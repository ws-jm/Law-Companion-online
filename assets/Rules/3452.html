Where interlineations, alterations, erasures, or obliterations appear in the Will (unless duly executed or recited in or otherwise identified by the attestation clause), an affidavit in proof of their having existed in the Will before its execution shall be filed. If no satisfactory evidence is adduced respecting the time when an erasure or obliteration was made, and the words erased or obliterated are not entirely effaced, and can, on inspection of the Will, be ascertained, they shall form part of the probate.
