<p>ISSUES</p>

<p>1. Whether the alleged bias against the appellants by the learned trial Judge in the course of the trial within trial ought to have vitiated the entire trial?</p>

<p>2. Whether the appellants ought to have been discharged and acquitted upon the finding of the Court of Appeal that Exhibits 4, 5 and 6 were wrongly admitted in evidence.</p>

<p>3. Whether the offences of conspiracy and armed robbery were proved against the appellants beyond reasonable doubt?</p>

<p>FACTS</p>

<p>The Appellants, herein, on or about the 18/8/07 while armed with a local pistol attacked and robbed one Alabi and dis-possessed her of certain amount of money. She raised an alarm and her child and husband gave the appellants a hot chase. The 1st appellant, as a result, was arrested at a place close to the scene after the 1st appellant, Kayode Babarinde, had exhausted the pellets in his locally made pistol. The other two appellants were subsequently arrested.</p>

<p>At the close of the trial, the learned trial judge found the three appellants guilty of the offences of criminal conspiracy and Armed robbery and were all convicted for the offences charged contrary to section 97 of the Penal Code of Northern Nigeria and under section 2 of the Robbery and Fire Arms (Special Provisions) Act, Cap 11 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004.</p>

<p>Dissatisfied the appellants un-successfully appealed to the Court of Appeal Ilorin Division. The lower court, in a unanimous decision affirmed the judgment of the trial High Court and dismissed the appeal of the appellants.</p>

<p>The appellants were aggrieved further and appealed to the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>HELD (Unanimously dismissing the Appeal)</p>

<p>1. On Status of a trial within Trial.</p>

<p>Applying the principles to the circumstances of this case, it is necessary to reiterate the fact that a trial within trial is a complete process in itself within the substantive trial. The trial court halts the main trial to conduct a mini trial specifically to determine whether or not a confessional statement allegedly made by an accused person was made voluntarily. K.M.O. Kereke-Ekun, JSC at Page 369.</p>

<p>2. On Meaning of Conspiracy.</p>

<p>In Obiakor Vs The State (2002) 6 SC (Part II) 33 @ 39 - 40 this court held, per Kalgo, JSC:</p>

<p>&quot;Conspiracy as an offence is the agreement by two or more persons to do or cause to be done an illegal act or legal act by illegal means. The actual agreement alone constitutes the offence and it is not necessary to prove that the act has in fact been committed. Because of the nature of the offence of conspiracy, it is rarely or seldom proved by direct evidence but by circumstantial evidence and inference from certain proved acts.&quot; K.M.O. Kereke-Ekun, JSC at Page 379.</p>

<p>3. On when Identification Parade is not necessary.</p>

<p>It is not in every case that an identification parade must be held to determine the identity of the persons (s) who commit a crime. For instance where a suspect is caught at the scene of crime or at a place closely connected with the scene of crime, it would not be necessary to conduct an identification parade. It would also not be necessary where by his confession, an accused person identified himself or where there is circumstantial evidence showing his involvement in the commission of the offence. K.M.O. Kereke-Ekun, JSC at Page 383.</p>

<p>4. On When Evidence of a single Witness could be sufficient to ground a Conviction.</p>

<p>From the facts of the instant case, the appellants were arrested shortly after the commission of the offence, at a time when PW3's memory was still fresh. Furthermore she had the opportunity of seeing them clearly when they pointed a gun at her since the unchallenged evidence is that her house was illuminated at the time.</p>

<p>It is trite that the evidence of a single witness could be sufficient to ground a conviction where the evidence is credible, cogent and of high quality so long as the evidence is not required to be corroborated. K.M.O. Kereke-Ekun, JSC at Page 383.</p>

<p>5. On Attitude of the Supreme Court to concurrent Findings of Fact by Two lower Courts.</p>

<p>In the instant case, notwithstanding the expunging of Exhibits 4, 5 and 6, there was sufficient cogent and credible evidence before the trial court to establish the offence of conspiracy against each of the appellants. Where there are concurrent findings of fact by two lower courts, this court would not interfere unless the appellants can show that the findings are perverse, not supported by the evidence, that there is a wrongful application of the law or that there has been a miscarriage of justice. K.M.O. Kereke-Ekun, JSC at Pages 383 - 384.</p>

<p>6. On the Ingredients of the offence of Armed Robbery.</p>

<p>With respect to the charge of armed robbery, the law is settled that in order to secure a conviction, the prosecution must prove the following beyond reasonable doubt:</p>

<p>a. That there was a robbery or series of robberies.</p>

<p>b. That each of the robberies was an armed robbery.</p>

<p>c. That the accused person was one of those who took part in the armed robbery. K.M.O. Kereke-Ekun, JSC at Page 384.</p>

<p>7. On What the Prosecution must prove to secure a Conviction for Armed Robbery.</p>

<p>In order to secure a conviction for armed robbery, the prosecution must prove that the accused person was armed with an offensive weapon. The weapon may be a gun or any other object likely to induce fear of bodily harm in the victim such as a cutlass or machete. Where a gun or other offensive weapon is used in the commission of a offence, it is not essential to tender the weapon to secure a conviction, provided there is cogent eye witness evidence or in the absence of eye witness evidence, there is enough Unequivocal circumstantial evidence that points to the guilt of the accused. K.M.O. Kereke-Ekun, JSC at Page 385.</p>

<p>8. On Whether the Prosecution is bound to call all available Witnesses.</p>

<p>Learned counsel for the 2nd and 3rd appellants has argued that failure to call Sunday as a witness was fatal to the prosecution's case and urged us to invoke Section 167 (d) of the Evidence Act, 2011 against the prosecution and hold that his evidence would have been unfavourable. It must be noted here that Section 167 (1) of the Evidence Act, 2011 deals with withholding evidence and not the failure to call a particular witness. In any event the law is quite well settled that it is not every available witness that must be called to testify in a case so long as those who do testify are able to discharge the burden of proof in the case being made out by a party. In other words, the evidence of the witness or witnesses in a criminal trial must be sufficient to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. K.M.O. Kereke-Ekun, JSC at Page 387.</p>

<p>9. On When Contradiction will be Fatal to Prosecution's Case.</p>

<p>The law is that it is only material contradictions in the case of the prosecution that will raise a doubt, the benefit of which ought, to be resolved in favour of the accused. It is only contradictions that are substantial and fundamental to the main issue in question that would be fatal to the prosecution's case. For a contradiction to be material it must not only relate to a material fact, it must in addition lead to a miscarriage of justice. K.M.O. Kereke-Ekun, JSC at Page 389.</p>

<p>10. On Effect of a Conviction of an Accused not based solely on expunged Evidence.</p>

<p>The inadmissibility of exhibits 4, 5 and 6 which were the confessional statements of the appellants herein, is not enough or sufficient to vitiate the conviction and sentence of the appellants for the offences charged as there are sufficient independent evidence on record to sustain the conviction. Where a conviction of an accused person is not based solely on an inadmissible or expunged confessional statement, but also on independent pieces of evidence which, in effect, corroborate the expunged confessional statement(s) as in the instant case, the conviction and sentence can be, and is in effect sustained by the independent evidence on record.</p>

<p>It is only where the conviction is based solely on the expunged confessional statement that the conviction and sentence is vitiated as there will be no evidence to support the charge. W.S.N. Onnoghen, JSC at Page 391.</p>

<p>11. On Distinction between a ratio decidendi and Orbiter Dictum.</p>

<p>It is common place that an orbiter dictum is an expression of opinion made in a giving statement by the Judge, but not necessary to his decision and as such cannot form part of the ratio decidendi of the Judgment. In other words an orbiter dictum of a Court does not have the status of a ratio decidendi; it does not decide the live issue in the matter; a ratio decidendi does. S. Galadima, JSC at Page 402.</p>

<p>12. On Status of a Trial within Trial.</p>

<p>It is instructive to note that those passing comments were made at the trial within trial proceedings with its own peculiarities and circumstances, and is an independent and distinct trial. A trial will entail due examination of witnesses or documents placed before a Court or both; the truth of a point or questions in dispute; and finally the finding fact or applicable law is pronounced in a Judgment. Suffices it to say that the comments of the learned trial Judge was made in relation to his findings in trial-within- trial, which in itself is a complete trial. S. Galadima, JSC at Page 403.</p>

<p>13. On Attitude of the Supreme Court to concurrent Findings of Fact by Two lower Courts.</p>

<p>The foregoing passages are the two concurrent findings of the two Courts below, and are unassailable. I can not disturb these findings as they are not perverse. S. Galadima, JSC at Page 406.</p>

<p>14. On How Criminal Conspiracy can be Established.</p>

<p>The offence of criminal conspiracy is sustained by leading evidence from which the Court can deduce inference of certain criminal acts of the person accused, done in pursuance of criminal purpose. It can be inferred from the attainment of common end. The conspirators need not to know themselves or to be in direct communication in respect of the offence charged. The Court can infere Conspiracy from the criminal acts of the parties including of complicity. S. Galadima, JSC at Page 406.</p>

<p>15. O Purport of Proof beyond Reasonable.</p>

<p>The burden of proof of the guilt of the accused person beyond reasonable doubt by the prosecution in criminal cases should not be taken to mean that the prosecution must sustain its case beyond every shadow of doubt. Once the prosecutor has been able to prove that an offence has been committed and that no person other than the accused committed the offence, the prosecution is said to have established its case beyond reasonable doubt. S. Galadima, JSC at Page 407.</p>

<p>Lead Judgment As delivered by</p>

<p>KUDIRAT M. OLATOKUNBO KEKERE- EKUN, JSC</p>

<p>The appellants were charged before the High Court of Kwara State, Ilorin Division on a two-count charge of conspiracy to commit armed robbery and armed robbery contrary to Section 97 of the Penal Code and Section 1 (2) of the Robbery and Firearms (Special Provisions) Act, Cap. R 11 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria (LFN), 2004 respectively. They were alleged to have robbed one Mrs. Ruth Alabi of the sum of N50, 000 while armed with a locally made pistol on 18/8/2007 at Baba Oloya Street, Jebba, within the jurisdiction of the court. Each of the accused persons pleaded not guilty to each count of the charge. The prosecution called three witnesses and tendered exhibits while the appellants each testified on their own behalf and called no other witness. At the conclusion of the trial, the High Court on 26/9/09 found each of the accused persons guilty as charged on each of the counts. They were sentenced to two years imprisonment on the count of conspiracy and death by hanging on the count of armed robbery.</p>

<p>Being dissatisfied with their conviction and sentence they appealed to the Court of Appeal, Ilorin Division by their notice of appeal dated 12/5/2010. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal on 23/2/2012 and upheld the conviction and sentence passed on them by the trial court. They appealed to this court vide their original notice of appeal dated 23/3/2012. Subsequently they sought and obtained leave to file their Amended Notice of Appeal dated 26/7/2012, which was deemed filed on 4/7/2013.</p>

<p>The 1st appellant's brief was settled by M.J. ONIGBANJO ESQ. It was filed on 27/7/2012.The following two issues were formulated for the determination of this appeal:</p>

<p>1. Whether the bias demonstrated by the trial court against the 1st Appellant and his co-accused persons ought to have vitiated the entire trial? (Grounds 1 and 2).</p>

<p>2. Whether the offences of criminal conspiracy and armed robbery were proved beyond reasonable doubt before the trial court? (Grounds 3, 4 and 5).</p>

<p>The 2nd and 3rd appellants' brief of argument was settled by OLUMUYIWA AKINBORD ESQ. In the said brief filed on 30/10/2012 four issues were formulated thus:</p>

<p>1. Whether the statement of the learned trial Judge during the entire proceedings against the 2nd and 3rd appellants did not conclusively present the state of mind of the learned trial Judge towards the accused and thereby exhibiting bias against them and amounting to denial of fair hearing, which ought to have persuaded the learned Justices of the Court of Appeal as vitiating the entire trial. (Grounds 1 and 2).</p>

<p>2. Whether the learned Justices of the Court of Appeal having found that Exhibits 4, 5 and 6 the confessional statements were wrongly admitted and that it was wrong for the trial court to have convicted the accused persons based on them ought not to have discharged and acquitted the 2nd and 3rd appellants. (Ground 3)</p>

<p>3. Whether the evidence of PW3 was not hearsay evidence on the issue of Exhibit 2. (Ground 5).</p>

<p>4. Whether the offences of criminal conspiracy and armed robbery against 2nd and 3rd appellants were proved beyond reasonable doubt before trial court. (Ground 6).</p>

<p>The respondent's brief filed on 21/1/13 but deemed filed on 4/7/2013 was settled by KAMALDEEN AJIBADE ESQ., the Attorney General of Kwara State. He formulated two issues for determination to wit:</p>

<p>1. Whether the inadmissibility of Exhibits 4, 5 and 6 (Confessional statements of the appellants) was enough to vitiate the whole trial. (Grounds 1, 2 and 3).</p>

<p>2. Whether the Court of Appeal was right to have held that the prosecution proved the offences of Criminal Conspiracy and Armed Robbery against the appellants beyond reasonable doubt. (Grounds 4, 5 and 6).</p>

<p>At the hearing of the appeal on 3/10/2013 learned counsel for the parties adopted and relied on their respective briefs of argument. Learned counsel for the appellants urged the court to resolve the appeal in their clients' favour, while learned counsel for the respondent urged the court to dismiss it.</p>

<p>Having carefully examined all the issues formulated by the parties I am of the view that the following three issues are the issues that call for resolution in this appeal:</p>

<p>1. Whether the alleged bias against the appellants by the learned trial Judge in the course of the trial within trial ought to have vitiated the entire trial? (1st Appellant's and 2nd and 3rd appellants' Issue 1).</p>

<p>2. Whether the appellants ought to have been discharged and acquitted upon the finding of the Court of Appeal that Exhibits 4, 5 and 6 were wrongly admitted in evidence. (2nd and 3rd appellants' issue 2 and respondent's issue 1).</p>

<p>3. Whether the offences of conspiracy and armed robbery were proved against the appellants beyond reasonable doubt? (1st appellant's issue 2, 2nd and 3rd appellants' issues 3 and 4 and Respondent's issue 2).</p>

<p>The appeal shall be determined on these three issues.</p>

<p>Issue 1</p>

<p>Whether the alleged bias against the appellants by the learned trial Judge in the course of the trial within trial ought to have vitiated the entire trial?</p>

<p>In support of this issue, learned counsel for the 1st appellant referred to page 70 of the record where in the course of ruling on the trial within trial to ascertain the voluntariness or otherwise of the alleged confessional statements of the accused persons the learned trial Judge made the following remarks:</p>

<p>&quot;The accused persons in their tutured (sic) position of wandering around their adhered style of telling lies in a desultory fashion...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What could be observed on the 3rd accused (DW2) is an improved style of telling lies to block some loop holes created by his comrade in crime&quot;</p>

<p>He submitted that the reference to the appellants as &quot;comrades in crime&quot; and &quot;liars&quot; was highly prejudicial to the 1st appellant and demonstrated that he had little or no chance of enjoying the benefit of the doubt that he would otherwise have been entitled to. He submitted that a real likelihood of bias existed. He submitted that in such situations the likelihood of bias taints the entire proceedings and that contrary to the conclusion reached by the Court of Appeal it does not matter whether the proceedings were decided on the merit or not. He referred to: Pavex International Co. Ltd. Vs I.B.W.A. (1994) 5 NWLR (Pt.347) 685 @ 701 G. He disagreed with the view of the learned Justices of the Court of Appeal that since that court had expunged the wrongly admitted statements from the record, the utterances of the learned trial Judge became empty or hollow and at best could be construed as merely obiter dicta. He submitted that in determining whether or not an allegation of bias is made out, the important consideration is the impression created in the minds of right thinking members of the society. He relied on: Azuokwu Vs Nwokanma (2005) 11 NWLR (Pt.937) 537 @ 551 E - F: Yakubu Vs The State (2007) 9 NWLR (Pt.1038) 1 @ 24 C - P. He contended that having uttered the prejudicial statements in the course of the trial within trial it would be highly improbable that the learned trial Judge would have purged himself of the bias exhibited earlier by the time he returned to the substantive trial. He argued that the likelihood of bias could not be removed post trial with the expunging of the confessional statements by the Court of Appeal, the learned trial Judge having already heard and determined the entire case with the alleged bias operating in his mind. He submitted further that it is of no consequence if the remarks of the learned trial Judge were made obiter or constitute the raito decidendi in the case. He referred to the case of Metropolitan Properties Co. (F.G.C.) Ltd. Vs Lannon (1969) QB 577 @ 599 wherein Lord Denning, MR. stated inter alia that in considering whether there is a real likelihood of bias the court does not look at the mind of the justice himself but at the impression that would be given to other right-minded people observing the proceedings. He submitted that no matter how well the proceedings are conducted, once bias is established, any decision reached therein is vitiated.</p>

<p>Learned counsel for the 2nd and 3rd appellants submitted that the learned Justices of the lower court erred in holding that the utterances of the learned trial Judge were mere obiter dicta and confined to the trial within trial proceedings. He contended that the state of mind of the learned trial Judge did not abate with the trial within trial proceedings but lasted throughout the trial and therefore denied the appellants their fundamental right of the presumption of innocence as provided for in Section 36 (5) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (hereinafter referred to as the 1999 Constitution). He argued that by referring to the appellants as &quot;comrades in crime&quot; the learned trial Judge had already formed an opinion as to their guilt. He referred to: Yakubu Vs The State (2007) 9 NWLR (1038) 1 &amp; 18 G, 19 E &amp; 24 C - D. On the appellants' right to fair hearing he referred to Section 36 (4) of the 1999 Constitution and cited the case of: Mohammed Vs Kano (1968) 5 NSCC 325 @ 327; Obadara &amp; Ors. Vs The President Ibadan West District Council Grade B Customary Court (1965) NMLR 39 (5) 44.</p>

<p>Learned counsel submitted that the issue of bias cannot be compartmentalised to an aspect of the trial and that once it is established that there is a real likelihood of bias an appellate court would intervene. He referred to: Azuokwu Vs Nwokanma (2005) 11 NWLR (Pt.937) 537 @ 551 E also cited earlier by learned counsel for the 1st appellant. He submitted that the duty on the court to intervene is even greater in a capital offence where the life of the accused is at stake. He relied on: Ijeoma Vs The State (1990) 6 NWLR (Pt.158) 567 (5) 586: Nwosu Vs The State (1986) 4 NWLR (Pt. 351) 348 @)359.</p>

<p>In reply to the above submissions, the learned Attorney General reproduced in extenso the finding of the court below on this issue. He submitted; that the allegation of bias was made in respect of the ruling of the learned trial Judge in the trial within trial on the voluntariness of Exhibits 4, 5 and 6. He submitted that the lower court expunged these documents from the record before affirming the judgment of the trial court based on the overwhelming evidence adduced by the prosecution. He submitted that evidence of bias on the part of a trial Judge or tribunal other than on the basis of pecuniary interest, as in the instant case, must be clear, direct, positive and unequivocal from which a real likelihood of bias could be inferred and not mere suspicion. He referred to: Hon. Justice Ayebe Vs Hon. Justice Adesiyuba &amp; Ors, (1997) 5 NWLR (Pt. 505) 403: Akoh Vs Abuh (1988) 3 NWLR (Pt. 85) 696. He submitted that there is no clear, positive, direct or unequivocal evidence upon which the allegation is premised other than the passing statement of the learned trial Judge. He conceded that the court is concerned not with the mind of the judge but with the impression created in the mind of a prudent, reasonable and right minded person in the circumstances of the case. He relied on: Onigbede Vs Balogun (2002) 6 NWLR (Pt.762) 1 @ 22 - 23. He asserted that the impression of any right minded person who had the opportunity of viewing and listening to the evidence led by the prosecution and defence would be no different from that of the learned trial Judge. He argued that this is why, in spite of expunging Exhibits 4, 5 and 6, the lower court reached the same conclusion as the trial court.</p>

<p>Learned counsel submitted further that a trial within trial is independent and distinct from the substantive trial in criminal proceedings and therefore observations, conclusions and findings made therein ought not to be viewed within the context of the main trial. He referred to the dictum of Oputa, JSC in Garba &amp; Ors. Vs The University of Maiduguri (1986) 2 SC 128 @ 268. He noted that in a trial within trial oaths are taken afresh, witnesses are called and counsel address the court before a ruling is delivered. He submitted that the trial Judge is expected to examine the conduct of the witnesses before making his findings. He contended that whatever comments the learned trial Judge made in the trial within trial in relation to the confessional statements went with the decision of the lower court to expunge them.</p>

<p>From paragraphs 2.20 to 2.27 of his brief, learned counsel addressed the issues raised under issue no. 2, which was dealt with separately by the appellants. I shall consider these submissions when dealing with issue 2.</p>

<p>In considering this issue it must be stated at the outset that all the parties are ad idem as to the position of decided authorities on what amounts to bias or likelihood of bias.</p>

<p>In a case where the learned trial Judge is accused of bias either during the course of proceedings or after the delivery of judgment, the court considering the issue would be guided by the decision in cases such as The Secretary Iwo Central LG Vs Adio (2000) 8 NWLR (Pt. 667) 115 where Ogundare, JSC at 133 F - G cited with approval the view of Lord Denning M.R. in Metropolitan Properties Co. (F.G.C.) Ltd. Vs Lannon (1969) 1 QB 577 @ 599, as follows:</p>

<p>&quot;There must be circumstances from which a reasonable man would think it likely or probable that the justice, or chairman, as the case may be, would, or did, favour one side unfairly at the expense of the other. The court will not enquire whether he did, in fact, favour one side unfairly. Suffice it that reasonable people might think he did. The reason is plain enough. Justice must be rooted in confidence', and confidence is destroyed when right-minded people go away thinking: &quot;The judge was biased&quot;.</p>

<p>In Womiloju Vs Anibire (2010) 10 NWLR (Pt.1203) 545 @ 571 G - H, His Lordship, Adekeye, JSC considered the terms &quot;judicial bias&quot; and &quot;bias&quot; as defined in Black's Law Dictionary 8th edition thus:</p>

<p>&quot;Black's Law Dictionary defines judicial bias as - &quot;A Judge's bias towards one or more of the parties to a case over which the judge presides. Judicial bias is usually insufficient to justify disqualifying a Judge from presiding over a case. To justify disqualification, the judge's bias usually must be personal or based on some extrajudicial reason. In the case Kenon Vs Tekam (2001) 14 NWLR (Pt. 732) 12, bias is defined as-</p>

<p>&quot;An opinion or feeling in favour of one side in a dispute or argument resulting in the likelihood that the court so influenced will be unable to hold an even scale3 (Emphasis supplied)</p>

<p>His Lordship went on to consider the test for determining the real likelihood of bias by referring, inter alia to the case of Metropolitan Properties Co. (F.G.C.) Ltd. Vs Lannon (supra). Also in Womiloju's case (supra), I.T. Muhammad, JSC stated at page 566 G:</p>

<p>&quot;The question [whether there is a real likelihood of bias] is always answered by inference drawn from the circumstances of the case. The reason for this attitude of the court is that it would be unseemly for the court to purport to pry into the state of mind of any judicial officer. See: Abiola Vs Federal Republic of Nigeria (1995) 7 NWLR (405) 1.&quot;</p>

<p>The effect of these decisions is that where the conduct of a trial Judge is impugned, a court looking into the matter would be guided by the inference that could be drawn by an ordinary bystander observing the proceedings. Applying the principles to the circumstances of this case, it is necessary to reiterate the fact that a trial within trial is a complete process in itself within the substantive trial. The trial court halts the main trial to conduct a mini trial specifically to determine whether or not a confessional statement allegedly made by an accused person was made voluntarily. See: Adelarin Lateef &amp; Ors. Vs F.R.N. (2010) 37 WRN 85 @ 107 lines 25 - 45; Jimoh &amp; Anor. Vs The State (2011) LPELR 4357 (CA) 1 @ 19 - 20 F - D. As submitted by learned counsel for the respondents, the witnesses in a trial within trial are re-sworn. They testify, call additional witnesses if necessary, and tender exhibits; the witnesses are subjected to cross-examination and at the conclusion of the trial, counsel to the parties address the court. The court delivers a considered ruling on the voluntariness or otherwise of the statements sought to be tendered. In the course of delivering that ruling the court, which had the opportunity of listening to and observing the witnesses for both sides, is obliged to give reasons for the conclusion reached. This will include the court's opinion on the credibility of the witnesses. An examination of the entire ruling shows that the learned trial Judge, after according the evidence led the necessary scrutiny, found that the appellants were not witnesses of truth and for this reason concluded that the statements attributed to them were made voluntarily. While the choice of language in the instant case leaves much to be desired, I am unable to agree with learned counsel for the appellants that the comments showed a likelihood of bias against the appellants in respect of the substantive trial. This issue is therefore resolved against the appellants.</p>

<p>Issues 2 and 3</p>

<p>Whether the appellants ought to have been discharged and acquitted upon the finding of the Court of Appeal that Exhibits 4, 5 and 6 were wrongly admitted in evidence?</p>

<p>Whether the offences of conspiracy and armed robbery were proved against the appellants beyond reasonable doubt?</p>

<p>These issues shall be considered together, as they are intertwined.</p>

<p>Mr. Onigbanjo, learned counsel for the 1st appellant submitted that in affirming the appellants' convictions and sentences and holding that the offence of conspiracy was proved, the lower court relied on the evidence of PW3 to the effect that the 1st accused was arrested first and that he was the one who mentioned the names of the other accused persons. He submitted that having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, PW3's evidence on how the appellants were arrested amounted to hearsay. On what amounts to hearsay, he referred to Section 37 (a) of the Evidence Act, 2011. He also relied on: FRN Vs Mohammed Usman (alias YaroYaro) &amp; Anor. (2012) LPELR SC. 28/2011 @ 17. He submitted further that since the fact of the 1st appellant's arrest and his subsequent implication of the other appellants in the commission of the offence was contained in the rejected confessional statements, the main plank upon which the lower court based its finding on &quot;agreement of minds&quot; between the appellants has been destroyed. He submitted that the lower court ought to have discharged and acquitted the appellants on the count of conspiracy.</p>

<p>On the charge of armed robbery, relying on the case of Attah Vs The State (2010) 10 NWLR (Pt.1201) 190, learned counsel submitted that in order to secure a conviction the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt that there was a robbery; that the robbery was an armed robbery and that the accused took part or was one of those who took part in the armed robbery. He submitted that the prosecution failed to prove the charge against the 1st appellant beyond reasonable doubt. He submitted that the Court of Appeal erred in relying on testimony based on confessional statements, which it had expunged from the record. He referred to the evidence of PW2 at page 251 of the record. He also referred to alleged inconsistencies in the evidence of PW3 (the complainant) regarding, among other things, the number of guns used in the commission of the offence; the exact amount of money stolen from her; the description of the clothes worn by the appellants; and where and how the appellants were arrested. He disagreed with the position of the lower court that the said contradictions were not material enough to warrant the setting aside of the decision of the trial court. He submitted further that the evidence of PW3 regarding the recovery of the gun (Exhibit 2) was hearsay while the evidence of PW2 in respect of the same issue was based on the 1st appellant's alleged confessional statement, which had since been expunged by the lower court. He submitted that in the absence of any evidence linking the 1st appellant with possession or ownership of Exhibit 2, a crucial ingredient of the offence (i.e. that the robbery was an armed robbery) was missing and therefore the prosecution had failed to establish its case against the 1st appellant beyond reasonable</p>

<p>It was argued on behalf of the 2nd and 3rd appellants that once the confessional statements, Exhibits 4, 5, and 6 were expunged from the record there was no surviving evidence upon which to base their conviction. Learned counsel, Mr. Akinboro, observed that PW1 (the exhibit keeper) only testified in respect of the exhibits in his custody and admitted under cross-examination that he was not present when the appellants were arrested. He contended further that the evidence of PW2 (the investigating police officer) was essentially to corroborate the contents of Exhibits 4, 5 and 6 and that once the lower court had expunged those exhibits his evidence ceased to have any value. He referred to aspects of PW2's evidence that indicated that he did not conduct a proper investigation once the 1st accused person allegedly confessed that he shot the gun.</p>

<p>He argued that if this court agrees that the evidence of PW1 and PW2 was lacking in substance, the only evidence upon which the conviction of the appellants could be upheld or quashed is the sole, uncorroborated evidence of PW3 (the complainant). While conceding that the court could safely base a conviction upon the evidence of a single witness, he submitted that such evidence must be of sufficient probative value. He referred to: Mohammed Vs The State (1991) 5 NWLR (Pt.192) 438 @ 451; Igbo Vs The State (1975) 9 - 11 SC 129. He submitted further that such evidence must be of such quality that it could only lead to a conclusion of the accused person's guilt.</p>

<p>On the quality of evidence required to prove a charge beyond reasonable doubt he referred to: Akalezi Vs The State (1993) 2 NWLR (Pt.273) 1; Bakare Vs The State (1987) 1 NWLR (Pt.52) 579 @ 595. He contended that the evidence of PW3 is full of contradictions and that the court cannot rely on it to convict the appellants in the absence of corroboration. He referred to various aspects of PW3's evidence, which in his view, demonstrated inconsistency and lack of credibility, some of which were highlighted earlier by learned counsel for the 1st appellant. He urged the court to discountenance her evidence and discharge and acquit the appellants. He contended that the learned Justices of the lower court erred in law when, having rejected and overturned the decision of the trial court on the admissibility of the confessional statements, it proceeded to rely on the testimony of one of the witnesses, founded on the rejected statements, to uphold the conviction.</p>

<p>He made similar submissions as those made by learned counsel for the 1st appellant and the issue of alleged hearsay evidence given by PW3 regarding the circumstances of the arrest of the 1st appellant and the recovery of Exhibit 2. On the need for a witness to testify in respect of matters within his personal knowledge and what amounts to hearsay evidence, he cited the cases of: Utteh Vs The State (1992) 2 NWLR (Pt.223) 257 &amp; 273: Judicial Service Commission Vs Omo (1990) 6 NWLR (Pt.157) 407: Adekea Vs Vattia (1987) 1 NWLR (Pt.48) 134: Jolayemi Vs Alaoye (2004) 12 NWLR (Pt.887) 322 @ 341: James Vs Nigerian Air Force (2000) 13 NWLR (Pt.684) 406 @ 422. He observed that PW3's son who allegedly saw the gun (Exhibit 2) drop from 1st appellant and apprehended him was not called to testify and therefore the evidence of PW3 regarding the recovery of the gun amounted to hearsay and was inadmissible. He submitted further that PW3's son was a material witness and that failure to call him to testify in proof of the fact that the robbery was an armed robbery was fatal to the prosecution's case. He relied on: Usufu Vs The State (2007) 1 NWLR (Pt.1020) 94 @ 118 C - D. On the failure of the prosecution to call PW3's son to testify, learned counsel urged us to invoke the provision of Section 167 (d) of the Evidence Act, 2011 against it and to presume that his evidence would have been unfavourable. He contended that having failed to prove the charge of armed robbery against the appellants the best that they could be convicted of is the offence of robbery. He submitted that in the circumstances the death sentence imposed on them ought to be commuted to 21 years imprisonment.</p>

<p>On proof of the offence of conspiracy, learned counsel referred to Section 96 of the Penal Code, which defines &quot;conspiracy&quot; as follows:</p>

<p>3 when two or more persons agree to do or cause to be done:</p>

<p>a. an illegal act; or</p>

<p>b. an act which is not illegal by illegal means.</p>

<p>Such an agreement is called conspiracy,&quot;</p>

<p>He conceded that proof of the offence of armed robbery against the appellants beyond reasonable doubt would sustain a conviction for the offence of conspiracy to commit the offence on the ground that proof of the offence charged is proof of confederacy by the accused persons to commit the said offence. He however contended that the essential ingredients of the offence were not proved beyond reasonable doubt. He maintained his earlier submission that once Exhibits 4, 5 and 6 were expunged from the record there was no evidence left upon which to base the conviction of the appellants for armed robbery. He submitted that the numerous doubts created in the mind of the court by the evidence of PW3 ought to be resolved in the appellants' favour. He relied on: Opara Vs The State (2006) 9 NWLR (Pt.986) 508 @ 527; Obiosa Vs Nigeria Air Force (2000) 12 NWLR (Pt.680) 112; Abdullahi Vs The State (2008) 17 NWLR (Pt.1115) 203 @ 221 - 222; Attah Vs The State (supra). He submitted that in the circumstances the conviction and sentences of the appellants are liable to be set aside and they are entitled to be discharged and acquitted. He referred to: Egbe Vs King (1950) 13 WACA 105: Alonge Vs IGP (1956) SCNLR 516.</p>

<p>As noted earlier learned counsel for the respondent addressed the issue of the fate of the prosecution's case upon Exhibits 4, 5 and 6 being expunged in paragraphs 2.20 - 2.27 of his brief under issue 1. He submitted that having regard to the &quot;irresistible&quot; evidence led by the prosecution coupled with the fact that the appellants merely asserted that they did not commit the crime without specifically denying any of the direct evidence led against them, the learned trial Judge had no alternative than to find the appellants guilty as charged and convict them accordingly. He submitted that, contrary to the submission of learned counsel for the appellant, the evidence of PW1 and PW2 was not based on the expunged statements but on their respective actions and findings in the course of the investigation. He submitted that their evidence was admissible and corroborated the evidence of PW3. He submitted that the appellants neither denied nor rebutted the evidence of PW2 as to what he saw and observed at the scene of crime. He referred to several authorities and submitted that in the circumstances the learned trial Judge was entitled to rely on the evidence.</p>

<p>I now return to learned counsel's arguments in opposition to the submissions of learned counsel for the appellants in respect of issues 2 and 3, which are being considered together. On proof of conspiracy learned counsel referred to the judgment of the lower court at pages 247 - 248 of the record wherein the learned Justices reviewed the evidence on the point and concluded that the offence of conspiracy had been proved beyond reasonable doubt. He also referred to the finding of the learned trial Judge at pages 120 - 122 of the record. He urged this court not to disturb the two concurrent findings of fact on the issue. He submitted that the prosecution need not prove that the conspirators met before carrying out their illegal act, as long as evidence is led from which the court could draw the inference of certain criminal acts done in pursuance of an apparent criminal purpose in common between them. He cited a recent decision of this court in support of his submission: Onyenye Vs The State (2012) ALL FWLR (Pt. 643) 1810 @ 1832 1833. He also referred to: Iwuneve Vs The State (2000) 5 NWLR (Pt. 658) 550 @ 560 - 561: Osondu Vs FRN (2000) 12 (Pt. 682) 483 @ 501 - 502. He submitted further that from the evidence of PW3 facts and circumstances surrounding the incident demonstrate all the necessary ingredients of conspiracy. He urged us to uphold the finding of the lower court that the offence of conspiracy was proved beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p>In reaction to the contention of learned counsel for the appellants that the evidence of PW3 was hearsay, learned counsel referred to her testimony at page 97 of the record. He submitted that having been confronted by the appellants' before they ran away she was able to identify them owing to the light in front of her house, which was on at the time. He submitted that PW3's identification of Exhibit 2 could also not amount to hearsay because from her evidence it was the weapon used to attack her and deprive her of her possessions. He submitted that her evidence in response to questions put to her during cross-examination revealed that the gun was pointed directly at her. On the contention that the prosecution failed to prove that the robbery was an armed robbery he referred to the concurrent findings of fact of the two lower courts as contained at pages 114 - 120 and 251 - 256 of the record and urged this court not to disturb the findings. He submitted further that proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond a shadow of a doubt. He submitted that the requirement of Section 138 (1) of the Evidence Act is that the prosecution must prove that an offence has been committed and that no other person other than the accused committed the offence. He submitted that the absence of reasonable doubt does not mean certainty of truth but a high degree of probability that the accused committed the offence. He cited the case of: Miller Vs Minister of Pension (1947) 2 ALL ER 371 @ 373 per H. Denning, J. (as he then was), and adopted by this Court in Ilori Vs The State (1980) 8 - 11 SC 81 @ 99: Akalezi Vs The State (1993) 2 NWLR (Pt. 273) 1 @ 13 C-D.</p>

<p>He submitted that the cogent and compelling direct evidence against the appellants, particularly the evidence of PW3, met the required standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt. He submitted that in the circumstances although there was no duty on the appellants to prove their innocence, the facts required some explanation from them. He referred to: Adepetu Vs The State (1998) 9 NWLR (Pt.565) 185 @ 207. He noted that each of the appellants merely testified that he did not commit the offence without more. He was of the view that failure to react to the damning evidence against them left the trial court with no alternative than to convict them as it did. In reaction to the contention of learned counsel for the 1st appellant that the lower court relied on the expunged statements in making its findings, learned counsel referred to page 251 of the record and submitted that the lower court based its findings on the testimony of PW2 as to his observations in the course of the investigation and not on the contents of the expunged statements.</p>

<p>On the contention that there were discrepancies in certain aspects of the prosecution's case learned counsel submitted that for such discrepancies or alleged contradictions to be fatal to the prosecution's case they must be substantial. He referred to: Shurumo Vs The State (2010) 16 NWLR (Pt. 1218) 65 @ 81: Abogede Vs The State (1996) 5 NWLR (Pt. 448) 270; Nasiru Vs The State (1999) 2 NWLR (Pt.589) 87. He submitted that alleged discrepancies are characteristic of a true story as opposed to a rehearsed tale. On the distinction between contradiction and discrepancies in the evidence of witnesses he referred us to the case of: Jerry Ikuepenikan Vs The State (2011) 1 NWLR (Pt. 1229) 449 @ 454. He urged us to discountenance the submissions of the respective learned counsel in this regard and to resolve the appeal in favour of the respondent.</p>

<p>It is the contention of learned counsel for the appellants that having expunged the confessional statements, Exhibits 4, 5 and 6, there was no credible evidence left upon which the lower court could have based its decision to uphold the convictions and sentences passed on the appellants by the trial court. It is therefore necessary to consider the findings of the lower court vis a vis the evidence on record before the trial court.</p>

<p>Section 96 of the Penal Code, which defines &quot;criminal conspiracy&quot;, has been reproduced earlier in this judgment. It is trite that conspiracy is seldom proved by direct evidenced. In Obiakor Vs The State (2002) 6 SC (Part II) 33 @ 39 - 40 this court held, per Kalgo, JSC:</p>

<p>&quot;Conspiracy as an offence is the agreement by two or more persons to do or cause to be done an illegal act or legal act by illegal means. The actual agreement alone constitutes the offence and it is not necessary to prove that the act has in fact been committed. Because of the nature of the offence of conspiracy, it is rarely or seldom proved by direct evidence but by circumstantial evidence and inference from certain proved acts.&quot; (Emphasis mine)</p>

<p>On the nature of proof required to establish criminal conspiracy, Achike, JSC had this to say in Oduneye Vs The State (2001) 1 SC (Part I) 1 @ 6 - 7:</p>

<p>&quot;A conviction for conspiracy is not without its inherent difficulties.... a successful conviction for conspiracy is one of those offences predicated on circumstantial evidence which is &quot;evidence not of the fact in issue but of other facts from which the fact in issue can be inferred......Evidence in this connection must be of such quality that irresistibly compels the court to make an inference as to the guilt of the accused.&quot; (Emphasis mine) also: Patrick Njovens Vs The State (1973) 5 SC 17: Dabo &amp; Anor. Vs The State (1977) 5 SC 22: Kaza Vs The State f 2008) 1 - 2 SC 151 a 164 - 165: Onyenye Vs The State (2012) ALL FWLR (Pt.643) 1810.</p>

<p>In challenging the judgment of the lower court on proof of conspiracy, learned counsel for the 1st appellant referred to a portion of the judgment from page 247 line 22 to page 248 line 2 of the record, wherein the court quoted the evidence of PW3 regarding the arrest of the appellants, and submitted that the said evidence was hearsay and therefore inadmissible. The portion of the judgment referred to reads thus:</p>

<p>&quot;Under cross-examination she answered: 2 It was the 1st accused who was first arrested before he mentioned the names of the other accused persons'.&quot; (Underlining by the lower court).</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that the portion of the judgment complained of is not a reflection of the entire finding of the court on the issue. Before considering the evidence of PW3 given under cross-examination, the lower court reproduced part of her evidence in chief, starting from page 247 line 14 as follows:</p>

<p>&quot;On 18/8/07 at about 9.30pm I was coming from my shop to my house when I took a motor bike home being ridden by a motor cyclist. As I came down on the motor cycle, I moved 2 (two) steps on the stair case and I saw the attackers with gun pointed at me. They asked if I will surrender my bag with money or my life. The people who attacked me are the accused persons standing trial. They snatched the bag from me and I started shouting as I ran to the door....&quot;(Underlining by the lower court).</p>

<p>Having reviewed the evidence of PW3 the lower court held at page 248 lines 3 - 22 of the record:</p>

<p>&quot;It can be gleaned from these pieces of evidence, particularly the underlined portions, that the appellants had an agreement or confederacy, overt or covert, to attack or rob the victim, PW2 (sic). This is demonstrable from the meteoric manner they swooped on the victim contemporaneously with their lethal club or weapon to dispossess her of her bag. Their joint or communal attack on their prey, the victim indicated that they were consensus ad idem prior to the onslaught on her. Their concurrent close in for the PW3 was not spontaneous or a fluke. Moreover the bald fact, based on the evidence, that the first appellant, mentioned the names of the other appellants shows that they had a previous unlawful pact over the attack on PW3 otherwise he (sic) would not have mentioned their names. Although they are not direct evidence of conspiracy they are impregnable and point irresistibly to the guilt of the appellants vis a vis the crime of conspiracy. To give greater verve to these pieces of evidence, they are both unchallenged and uncontroverted viva voce testimony. &quot;(Emphasis mine).</p>

<p>It is evident from the reasoning of the court reproduced above that the lower court did not rely solely on PW3's evidence that the 1st appellant was arrested first and that it was he who gave the names of the other appellants. The court took into consideration the fact that PW3's evidence as to how she was attacked by three persons at gun point, raised the inference that there must have been a meeting of the minds between them and that the attack was neither spontaneous nor a fluke. It was on this basis that the lower court upheld the finding of the trial court that the offence of conspiracy had been made out by the prosecution. Thus even if it were conceded that the evidence elicited from PW3 under cross-examination was hearsay and therefore inadmissible, her evidence in chief stating how she was robbed and her vivid account of the incident was sufficient proof of the offence of conspiracy.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I do not agree with the contention that PW3's evidence regarding the 1st appellant's arrest amounts to hearsay. The lower court at page 253 of the record referred to her evidence under cross-examination where she stated inter alia:</p>

<p>&quot;I was already at the police station before the accused persons were arrested. It was the 1st accused who was first arrested before he mentioned the names of the other persons.&quot;</p>

<p>The evidence indicates clearly that although PW3 was not present when the appellants were arrested she was already at the police station when the 1st appellant was brought in. Her testimony that he was arrested first before the other two appellants is therefore direct evidence of what she personally observed. That evidence has not been rebutted. She identified the appellants as the persons who acted in concert and attacked her on the fateful day. It was contended by learned counsel for the 2nd and 3rd appellants that PW3 was only able to identify the appellants because they were pointed out to her by the police, as she had admitted under cross-examination that she did not know them before the incident. This issue was raised at the court below. In resolving it the lower court held at page 255 of the record:</p>

<p>&quot;From the evidence, PW3 saw the appellants who pointed gun at her and snatched her bag at Baba Olaya, Jebba, the locus criminis. She identified them because the locus criminis was lit or illuminated by the electric light in her house and her surrounding mileu, which made her recognise them at the Jebba Police Station. There is evidence that the first appellant was arrested and handed over to the Police Divisional Headquarters, Jebba and he acted as a pointer to the apprehension of the second and third appellants. That confirmed that the appellants were associates-in-the-crime regarding the armed robbery. She was never shaken in her evidence that she was robbed with a gun on 18/8/2007. Her evidence further unveiled the colour of the dresses two of them wore on that fateful day - one wore white while the other was clad in red colour attire, short sleeve. PW1 gave unchallenged evidence of how the second appellant took them to where he kept the bag they collected from PW3.&quot; (Underlining mine).</p>

<p>It is not in every case that an identification parade must be held to determine the identity of the persons (s) who commit a crime. For instance where a suspect is caught at the scene of crime or at a place closely connected with the scene of crime, it would not be necessary to conduct an identification parade. It would also not be necessary where by his confession, an accused person identified himself or where there is circumstantial evidence showing his involvement in the commission of the offence. See: Ikemson Vs The State (1989) 3 NWLR (Pt.110) 455: Ebenehi Vs The State (2008) 10 NWLR (Pt. 1096) 596 at 607 G - H. From the facts of the instant case, the appellants were arrested shortly after the commission of the offence, at a time when PW3's memory was still fresh. Furthermore she had the opportunity of seeing them clearly when they pointed a gun at her since the unchallenged evidence is that her house was illuminated at the time.</p>

<p>It is trite that the evidence of a single witness could be sufficient to ground a conviction where the evidence is credible, cogent and of high quality so long as the evidence is not required to be corroborated. See: Oguonzee Vs The State (1998) 5 NWLR (Pt.551) 521: (1998) 4 SC 110: Effiong Vs The State (1998) 8 NWLR (Pt.562) 362: (1998) 5 SC 136. In the instant case, notwithstanding the expunging of Exhibits 4, 5 and 6, there was sufficient cogent and credible evidence before the trial court to establish the offence of conspiracy against each of the appellants. Where there are concurrent findings of fact by two lower courts, this court would not interfere unless the appellants can show that the findings are perverse, not supported by the evidence, that there is a wrongful application of the law or that there has been a miscarriage of justice. See: Igwego Vs Ezeugo (1992) 6 NWLR (Pt.249) 561: (1992) 7 SCNJ 284: Okoye Vs Obiaso (2010) 8 NWLR (Pt.1195) 145: Cameroon Airlines Vs Otutuizu (2011) 1 - 2 SC (Pt. III) 200, The appellants herein have failed to show that any of the named circumstance exists to warrant interference by this court.</p>

<p>With respect to the charge of armed robbery, the law is settled that in order to secure a conviction the prosecution must prove the following beyond reasonable doubt:</p>

<p>a. That there was a robbery or series of robberies.</p>

<p>b. That each of the robberies was an armed robbery.</p>

<p>c. That the accused person was one of those who took part in the armed robbery.</p>

<p>See: Bozin Vs The State (1985) 2 NWLR (8) 465; Afolalu Vs The State (2010) 16 NWLR (Pt.1220) 584; Eke Vs The State (2011) 3 NWLR (Pt.1235) 589; Bello Vs The State (2007) 10 NWLR (Pt. 1043) 564.</p>

<p>The fact that there was a robbery on 18/8/2007 at Jebba in Moro Local Government Area of Kwara State is not in dispute, which satisfies the first ingredient above. Learned counsel for the respective appellants however contend that the prosecution failed to prove the other two ingredients of the offence beyond reasonable doubt. As to whether or not the robbery was an armed robbery learned counsel for the appellants have laboured to assert that this ingredient of the offence could only be established by linking the gun, Exhibit 2, to any of the appellants. In order to secure a conviction for armed robbery, the prosecution must prove that the accused person was armed with an offensive weapon. The weapon may be a gun or any other object likely to induce fear of bodily harm in the victim such as a cutlass or machete. Where a gun or other offensive weapon is used in the commission of a offence, it is not essential to tender the weapon to secure a conviction, provided there is cogent eye witness evidence or in the absence of eye witness evidence, there is enough Unequivocal circumstantial evidence that points to the guilt of the accused. See: Alor Vs the State (1996) 4 NWLR (Pt.445) 726 @ 742 - 743 H - A. In the case of Dibie Vs the State (2004) 14 NWLR (Pt.893) 257 @ 280 - 281 H - A. it was held that whether it was a real pistol or something that looked like a pistol that was pointed at the witness was immateria . What was material was that either an actual pistol or what looked like a pistol was used to threaten the witness and induced fear in her. See also: Sele Vs State (1993) 1 NWLR (Pt.269) 276.</p>

<p>In the instant case the lower court reviewed the evidence of PW3 both in chief and under cross-examination to the effect that a gun was pointed at her during the robbery and the threat of the robbers to kill her if she failed to comply with their demands. Also considered was her evidence that after being threatened at gun point, they snatched her bag and left. With regard to the evidence of PW2, the court, at page 251 of the record, reproduced the following excerpt of his testimony:</p>

<p>&quot; I visited the scene of crime with both complainant [and] accused persons. At the scene of crime I discovered that the house of the 3rd accused is very close to the house of the complainant corroborating the evidence of the statement of the 1st accused that the 3rd accused withdrew to avoid recognition. The 2nd accused took us to where he abandoned the bag he collected from the victim when he was running away. My investigation revealed that the 3 accused persons did rob the complainant on gun point&quot; &quot;(Emphasis mine).</p>

<p>The lower court found as follows at page 254 of the record:</p>

<p>&quot;Flowing from the above excerpts of the evidence of PW2 and PW3, it is crystal clear that the PW3, a food vendor, was robbed by the appellants on 18/8/2007 around 9.30pm in front of her house at Baba Oloya, Jebba and dispossessed of her bag containing some money. There is no better evidence of robbery than the ones offered by the respondent.</p>

<p>Furthermore the testimonies show case that the robbery or larceny was armed robbery in the sense that the theft on the PW3, the victim, was actuated by the use of a locally made pistol, received in evidence as Exhibit 2. ... The pointing of the locally made pistol on PW3 by the appellants, from the evidence, rattled and instilled fear of losing her life in her. Hence PW3 who was a stranger to the likes of Exhibit 2, since her birth, was scared and obeyed the appellants in order to preserve her precious and priceless life. ... From the evidence, PW3 saw the appellants who pointed gun at her and snatched her bag at Baba Olaya, Jebba, the locus criminis.&quot;</p>

<p>The salient point here is that the evidence of PW3 that a gun was pointed at her during the robbery incident, which made her relinquish her handbag containing some amount of money was not controverted and remained unshaken under cross -examination. She testified that upon hearing her shout, her husband and son came out and pursued the robbers and that it was while her son, Sunday, was pursuing the 1st appellant that he (1st appellant) dropped the gun. Since she did not join in the pursuit of the robbers, it is correct, as contended by learned counsel for the 2nd and 3rd appellants that she could not have been present when the gun was recovered. Her evidence regarding the circumstances in which the gun was recovered is indeed hearsay and inadmissible. However, from her testimony she was able to describe and identify Exhibit 2 because she saw it at close range. Both the trial court and the court below found her evidence in this regard to be cogent and convincing. I see no reason to disturb their finding in this regard.</p>

<p>Learned counsel for the 2nd and 3rd appellants has argued that failure to cal party. In other words, the evidence of the witness or witnesses in a criminal trial must be sufficient to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. See: Aliyu Vs The State (20131 LPELR-SC.104/2011 @ 18 B G; Akalonu Vs The State (2002) 6 SC (Pt.II) 107 @ 112 113; Alonge Vs I.G.P. (1959) 4 F.S.C. 203. In the instant case the lower court was right when it held that Sunday's evidence was not vital in establishing whether the robbery was an armed robbery or not, particularly as he did not witness the robbery but only gave chase after he heard his mother's shout.</p>

<p>A lot of dust has been raised regarding the reliance by the lower court on the evidence of PW2 wherein he stated that upon investigation he discovered that the 3rd appellant's house was close to PW3's house, and that his discovery corroborated certain statements made in the alleged confessional statement of the 1st appellant, already expunged by that court. It is important to note that the lower court considered the entirety of the evidence before the trial court and did not rely solely on this aspect of PW2's testimony. PW2 stated categorically that the 2nd appellant took the team to the place where he abandoned the bag he collected from the victim when he was running away. This evidence when considered alongside the evidence of PW3 as to how her bag was snatched from her after being threatened at gun point, leaves one in no doubt that the robbery was an armed robbery. The appellants have failed to show that the findings of the two lower courts in this regard are perverse. Therefore the fact that Exhibits 4, 5 and 6 were expunged did not prevent the lower court from considering the case on its merits and making appropriate findings. As observed earlier there was sufficient evidence outside the confessional statements upon which the lower court could base its findings.</p>

<p>The third ingredient of the offence of armed robbery is whether the appellants were those who robbed PW3 or were among those who committed the offence. Both learned counsel for the respective appellants argued that there were many contradictions in the evidence of the prosecution witnesses, material enough to warrant the setting aside of their convictions and sentences. Some of the alleged contradictions are as follows:</p>

<p>1. That whereas in her evidence in chief PW3 stated that a gun was pointed at her, under cross-examination she stated that the robbers pointed two guns at her from both sides.</p>

<p>2. That while she stated in her evidence in chief and in her statements to the police (Exhibits 7 and 7A) that the robbers collected N50, 000 from her, under cross- examination she stated that the amount was N40,000.</p>

<p>3. That she was unable to state the colour of the clothes worn by her attackers.</p>

<p>4. That having stated that she was 40 years old, her testimony that her first son was 30 years old could not be true.</p>

<p>5. That PW2 and PW3 contradicted each other regarding the location where the 1st appellant was arrested.</p>

<p>6. That the prosecution failed to link Exhibit 2 to the 1st appellant having regard to the fact that PW2 relied on the 1st appellant's alleged confession and the said statement had been expunged.</p>

<p>The law is that it is only material contradictions in the case of the prosecution that will raise a doubt, the benefit of which ought, to be resolved in favour of the accused. It is only contradictions that are substantial and fundamental to the main issue in question that would be fatal to the prosecution's case. For a contradiction to be material it must not only relate to a material fact, it must in addition lead to a miscarriage of justice. See: Dibie Vs The State (2004) 14 NWLR (Pt.893) 257 at 280 A - P: Ikemson Vs The State (1989) 2 NSCC (Vol. 20) 471: Onubogu Vs The State (1974) 1 All NLR (Part II) 5: Okonji Vs The State (1987) 1 NWLR (Pt.52) 659: Shurumo Vs The State (2010) 10 NWLR (Pt.1218) 65 (5) 81. The lower court reviewed the alleged contradictions referred to above at pages 256 - 261 of the record and held, rightly in my view, that they are not material and do not detract from the facts established by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt, to wit: that there was a robbery on 18/8/2007, that the robbers were armed with an offensive weapon, that in the course of the robbery some money was stolen from PW3 and that the appellants were the ones who carried out the armed robbery.</p>

<p>In concluding its judgment the lower court held at pages 267 - 268 of the record:</p>

<p>&quot;When those Improperly received exhibits [Exhibits 4, 5 and 6] are excluded from the case, the unchallenged, uncontroverted and credible eye witness evidence of PW3 clearly demonstrated and fixed the appellants as the perpetrators of the heinous and rampant offences of criminal conspiracy and armed robbery levelled against them. Put starkly, the absence of Exhibits 4, 5 and 6 does not exculpate the appellants when the direct testimonies of PW3 establish beyond reasonable doubt their culpability for those offences of criminal conspiracy and armed robbery that are menaces to the fragile Nigerian society. In the circumstance I would be loath to upset the Judgment of the lower court since the expunction of those exhibits has left the judgment, unscathed.&quot;</p>

<p>In consequence thereof the lower court dismissed the appeal and affirmed the convictions and sentences of all the appellants. I find no reason to disturb the said finding and conclusion. Issues 2 and 3 are accordingly resolved against the appellants. In effect the appeal lacks merit and is hereby dismissed. The judgment of the Court of Appeal, Ilorin Division delivered on 23/2/2012 upholding the convictions and sentences of the appellants for conspiracy and armed robbery is hereby affirmed.</p>

<p>WALTER SAMUEL NKANU ONNOGHEN, JSC</p>

<p>I have had the benefit of reading in draft, the lead judgment of my learned brother KEKERE-EKUN, JSC just delivered.</p>

<p>I agree with his reasoning and conclusion that the appeal is without merit and should be dismissed.</p>

<p>The inadmissibility of exhibits 4, 5 and 6 which were the confessional statements of the appellants herein, is not enough or sufficient to vitiate the conviction and sentence of the appellants for the offences charged as there are sufficient independent evidence on record to sustain the conviction. Where a conviction of an accused person is not based solely on an inadmissible or expunged confessional statement, but also on independent pieces of evidence which, in effect, corroborate the expunged confessional statement(s) as in the instant case, the conviction and sentence can be, and is in effect sustained by the independent evidence on record.</p>

<p>It is only where the conviction is based solely on the expunged confessional statement that the conviction and sentence is vitiated as there will be no evidence to support the charge.</p>

<p>It is for the above and the detailed reasons contained in the said lead judgment of my learned brother that I too dismiss the appeal.</p>

<p>Appeal dismissed.</p>

<p>M. S. MUNTAKA-COOMASSIE, JSC</p>

<p>The Appellants, herein, on or about the 18/8/07 while armed with a local pistol attacked and robbed one Alabi and dis-possessed her of certain amount of money. She raised an alarm and her child and husband gave the appellants a hot chase. The 1st appellant, as a result, was arrested at a place close to the scene after the 1st appellant, Kayode Babarinde, had exhausted the pellets in his locally made pistol. The other two appellants were subsequently arrested.</p>

<p>At the close of the trial, the learned trial judge found the three appellants guilty of the offences of criminal conspiracy and Armed robbery and were all convicted for the offences charged contrary to section 97 of the Penal Code of Northern Nigeria and under section 2 of the Robbery and Fire Arms (Special Provisions) Act, Cap 11 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004.</p>

<p>Dissatisfied the appellants un-successfully appealed to the Court of Appeal Ilorin Division. The lower court, in a unanimous decision affirmed the judgment of the trial High Court and dismissed the appeal of the appellants.</p>

<p>The appellants were aggrieved further and appealed to the Supreme Court and filed a notice of appeal containing four (4) grounds of appeals. I reproduce the 4 grounds without their respective particulars.</p>

<p>GROUND ONE</p>

<p>The learned Justices of the Court of Appeal erred in law when it failed to discharge and acquit the Appellants after it had over ruled the trial court's admission of Exhibits 4, 5 and 6 as confessional statements.</p>

<p>GROUND TWO</p>

<p>The learned Justices of the Court of Appeal erred in law when they held the Appellants guilty of the count of criminal conspiracy.</p>

<p>GROUND THREE</p>

<p>The learned Justices of the Court of Appeal erred in law when they held that the Appellants were guilty of the offence of armed robbery.</p>

<p>GROUND FOUR</p>

<p>The learned Justices of the Court of Appeal erred in law when they convicted the Appellants of the offence of armed robbery on the basis that the evidence of the prosecution's evidence was unchallenged and uncontroverted.</p>

<p>The 1st appellants formulated two (2) issues thus:-</p>

<p>1. Whether the bias demonstrated by the trial court against the 1st Appellant and his co-accused persons ought to have vitiated the entire trial?</p>

<p>2. Whether the offences of the criminal conspiracy and armed robbery were proved beyond reasonable doubt before the trial court?</p>

<p>While the 2nd and 3rd Appellants formulated four (4) issues as follows:-</p>

<p>1. Whether the statements of the learned trial Judge during the entire proceeding against the 2nd and 3rd appellants did not conclusively present the state of mind of the learned trial judge towards the accused hereby exhibiting bias against them and amounting to denial of fair hearing which ought to have persuaded the learned Justice of the Court of Appeal as vitiating the entire trial.</p>

<p>2. Whether the learned Justices of the Court of Appeal having found that Exhibits 4, 5 and 6 the confessional statement were wrongly admitted and that it was wrong for the trial court to have convicted the accused persons based on them ought not to have discharged and acquitted the 2nd and 3rd appellants.</p>

<p>3. Whether the evidence of PW3 was not hearsay evidence on the issue of Exhibit 2.</p>

<p>4. Whether the offences of Criminal Conspiracy and armed robbery against the 2nd and 3rd appellants were proved beyond reasonable doubt before the trial court&quot;</p>

<p>I was privileged to have read in a draft form the illuminating lead judgment of my learned brother Kekere-Ekun, JSC. The reasons and conclusion are agreeable to me. I adopt them; with tremendous respect, as mine. Without much ado, I will say that my lord Kekere-Ekun JSC has painstakingly thrashed out all the issues submitted to us amicably and correctly too.</p>

<p>I therefore agree entirely with my learned brother. I too accept that the appeal is devoid of any merit and same is hereby dismissed.</p>

<p>SULEIMAN GALADIMA, JSC</p>

<p>The draft of the lead judgment in this appeal just delivered by my learned brother KEKERE-EKUN JSC was made available to me. I entirely agree with his detailed reasoning leading to the conclusion dismissing this appeal.</p>

<p>The Appeal is against the Judgment of the Court of Appeal Ilorin Division, delivered on 23/2/2012 affirming the decision of the trial High Court Kwara State Coram L.B. Garba (J) in which the Appellants were convicted for the offences of Criminal Conspiracy and Armed Robbery contrary to section 97 of the penal Code and section (2) of the Robbery and Fire Arms (Special provisions) Act, cap 111, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004.</p>

<p>Briefly the facts are these: On or about the 18th day of August, 2007, the Appellants at Baba Olaya Area of Jebba town in Kwara, while armed with a locally made pistol attacked and robbed one Ruth Alabi and dispossessed her of certain amount of money. She immediately raised alarm after the robbery incident. This attracted the attention of her husband and her grown up child who pursued the Appellants. This yielded results. The 1st Appellant was arrested at a place close to the scene of crime after he had exhausted the pellets in his pistol. His arrest led to the apprehension of the other two Appellants.</p>

<p>In the course of their trial the statement of the three Appellants were admitted in evidence after a trial-within-trial was conducted by the learned trial Judge. At the close of the hearing of the case the Judge found the Appellants guilty and accordingly convicted them. Dissatisfied with the Judgment of the trial Court, the Appellants appealed to the Court of Appeal, which in its unanimous decision affirmed the judgment of the trial High Court. Hence this appeal is in furtherance of the Appellants' quest to exhaust all avenues opened to them to save themselves from being guillotined.</p>

<p>In their amended Notice of Appeal deemed filed on 4/7/2013, the Appellants set out six grounds.</p>

<p>The grounds shorn of particulars read as follows:</p>

<p>GROUND ONE</p>

<p>The learned Justices of the Court of Appeal erred in Law when they held that the prejudicial utterances and statements of the trial judge were passing remarks which did not form the ratio decidendi and as such did not taint the proceedings with bias.</p>

<p>GROUND TWO</p>

<p>The learned Justices of the Court of Appeal erred in Law when they held that the prejudicial and biased statements of the trial judge uttered during the trial-within-trial had no effect on the outcome of the substantive proceedings conducted by the same trial judge.</p>

<p>GROUND THREE</p>

<p>The learned Justices of the Court of Appeal erred in Law when it failed to discharge and acquit the Appellants after it had over-ruled the trial Court's admission of exhibits 4, 5, and 6 as confessional statements.</p>

<p>GROUND FOUR</p>

<p>The learned Justices of the Court of Appeal erred in Law when they held the Appellants guilty of the count of Criminal Conspiracy.</p>

<p>GROUND FIVE</p>

<p>The learned Justices of the Court of Appeal erred in Law when they held that the Appellants were guilty of the offence of armed robbery.</p>

<p>GROUND SIX</p>

<p>The learned Justices of the Court Appeal erred in Law when they convicted the Appellants of the offence of armed robbery on the basis that the evidence of the prosecution's witness was unchallenged and uncontroverted.</p>

<p>The 1st Appellant formulated two issues as follows:</p>

<p>1. &quot;Whether the bias demonstrated by the trial Court against the 1st Appellant and his co-accused persons ought to have vitiated the entire trial.</p>

<p>2. Whether the offences of Criminal Conspiracy and armed robbery were proved beyond reasonable doubt before the trial Court.&quot;</p>

<p>2nd and 3rd Appellants issues submitted for determination run as follows:</p>

<p>(1) whether the statements of the learned trial Judge during the entire proceeding against the 2nd and 3rd Appellants did not conclusively present the state of mind of the learned trial judge towards the accused hereby exhibiting bias against them and amounting to denial of fair hearing which ought to have persuaded the learned Justices of the Court of appeal as vitiating the entire trial.</p>

<p>(2) Whether the learned Justices of the Court of Appeal having found that Exhibits 4, 5 and 6 the confessional statement were wrongly admitted and that it was wrong for the trial Court to have convicted the accused persons based on them ought not to have discharged and acquitted the 2nd and 3rd Appellants.</p>

<p>(3) Whether the evidence of PW3 was not hearsay evidence on the issue of Exhibit 2</p>

<p>(4) Whether the offences of Criminal Conspiracy and armed robbery against the 2nd and 3rd Appellants were proved beyond reasonable doubt before the trial Court.&quot;</p>

<p>The appeal came up for hearing on the 3/10/2013. Learned Counsel for the 1st Appellant J. M. M. Majiyagbe Esq. identified and adopted the brief deemed filed on 4/7/2013 and urged the Court to allow the appeal. The 2nd and 3rd Appellants' brief of argument was deemed filed also on 4/7/2013. Learned Counsel Olumuyiwa Akinboro Esq. relied on this brief and urged the Court to dismiss the appeal. Kamaldeen Ajibade Hon. Attorney-General Kwara State, learned Counsel for the Respondent also adopted and relied on the Respondent's brief of argument deemed filed on 4/7/2013.</p>

<p>I have carefully studied the issues formulated by the Counsel in this appeal. From the three amended Notice and Grounds of Appeal the relevant issues that are apt to the determination of the appeal are those two issues distilled by the 1st Appellant and the Respondent in their respective briefs of argument. Issue 3 of the 2nd and 3rd Respondents' brief in my view do not arise from any of their Grounds of appeal.</p>

<p>On the first issue 1st Appellant's Counsel submitted that the statements of the trial judge referring to the Appellants as &quot;Comrades in Crime and &quot;liars&quot; was highly prejudicial to the 1st Appellant. In other words that the Statement demonstrated that the 1st Appellant had little or no chance of enjoying the benefit of any doubt he would have otherwise been entitled to. Relying on the case of Pavex Int. Co. Ltd v. IBWA (1994) 5 NWLR (Pt 347) 685 at 701, learned Counsel contended that the real likelihood of bias taints the entire proceedings, and destroys the foundation of the decision reached by the trial Court. Further reliance was placed on the cases of Azuokwu V. Nwokanma (2005) II NWLR (Pt 937) 537 at 551 and Obadara &amp; Ors V. The President Ibadan West District Council Grade &#96;B' Customary Court (1965) NMLR 39 at 44.</p>

<p>On the second issue, the contention of the learned Counsel for the 1st Appellant is that, considering the definition of &quot;Criminal Conspiracy&quot; in Section 96 of the Penal Code Law Cap P.4 Laws of Kwara State, 2006, the prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that there was a meeting of minds between the 1st Appellant and the 2nd 3rd Appellants to rob the victim.</p>

<p>On their part on issue 1, the 2nd and 3rd Appellants have advanced their arguments critical of the statements of the learned trial Judge during the entire proceedings against the 2nd and 3rd Appellants. Their grouse is that whilst admitting Appellants' confessional Statement, the learned trial Judge stated at page 70 of the records thus:</p>

<p>&quot;the accused persons in their tutored position of wandering around their adhered style of telling lies in a desultory fashion.&quot;</p>

<p>The Court on the same page further stated thus as follows.</p>

<p>&quot;What could be observed on the 3rd accused (DW2) is an improved style of telling lies by trying to block some loop holes created by COMRADE in Crime (2nd - accused - DW1 who gave evidence before him.</p>

<p>It is the foregoing statements the 2nd and 3rd Appellants consider as exhibiting bias against them and accounting to denial of fair hearing which ought to have persuaded the Learned Justices of the Court below to vitiate the entire trial. The Court below however, held that the utterances of the learned trial Judge were made obiter dictum and are restricted to the trial-within-trial proceedings and therefore could not have contaminated the whole trial in order for same to be nullified.</p>

<p>On issue 2, it is submitted by the learned Counsel for the 2nd and 3rd Appellants that Exhibits 4, 5 and 6 having been expunged, the evidence of PW3, which is the sole evidence left on the records being incoherent, contradictory, unreliable and of no probative value or credibility cannot be relied upon to convict or uphold the conviction of the Appellants, so much so that the charge of criminal conspiracy was based on the inadmissible evidence in Exhibits 4, 5, and 6.</p>

<p>It is finally urged on this Court to hold that there was no proof beyond reasonable doubt that the 2nd and 3rd Appellants committed the offences with which they were charged.</p>

<p>On its part the Respondent, on the first issue, contended that the Court below was right to have held that the inadmissibility of exhibits 4, 5 and 6 (the Confessional Statements of the Appellants) was not enough to vitiate the whole trial. It is submitted on the second issue that the prosecution proved the offences of Criminal Conspiracy and Armed Robbery against the Appellants beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p>Having regard to the six grounds appeal filed by the Appellants herein, the two issues presented by the Respondent, are apt and quite appropriate to dispose of the appeal.</p>

<p>The first issue is whether the Court below was right to have come to the conclusion that the passing remarks made by the learned trial Judge in the trial-within-trial were obiter dicta, enough to vitiate the whole trial, having regard to the ruling of that Court on the inadmissibility of Exhibits 4, 5 and 6 (Confessional Statements of the Appellants).</p>

<p>The Court below resolved this issue in great details on pages 241 - 244 of the records, particularly pages 241-242, thus:-</p>

<p>That brings me to the resolution of issue two. The fulcrum of that issue is that the appellants' right of presumption of innocence was violated during the trial-within-trial proceedings. To begin with, I must place on record that the issue has nexus with the first issue just determined. This is because it is still a vitriolic attack on the observations or comments made by the lower Court in the trial within trial proceeding. In the light of this affinity, the resolution of issue one dovetails with it. In this wise, my finding or conclusion on issue one rears its head here and becomes relevant. It will be recalled that Exhibits 4, 5 and 6 were dispensed with, as unwanted documents from the appeal for reason of involuntariness. Having removed them, the undoubted end products of that trial within trial proceeding, it seems clear to me that this issue, which is hosted or warehoused in that mini-trial adjudication, becomes totally nude. It has no pedestal to stand or proceeding to be anchored to, Exhibits 4, 5 and 6, the desiderata in that proceeding, have been removed as in admissible.&quot;</p>

<p>The Court below further concluded to the trial Court's comments on page 70 of the records. The relevant passage of that Judgment reads as follows:</p>

<p>&quot;The accused persons in their tortured (sic) position of wondering around their adhered style of telling lies in a desultory fashion, they left an otherwise yarning gap that detonated their position which they could not fill.&quot;</p>

<p>The trial Court on the same page proceeded to give a few instances of these &quot;gaps&quot; thus:</p>

<p>&quot;(a) the 2nd accused (DWL Akeem Haruna) when cross-examined said: that his statement was taken in the torture chambers where there was no light and window. The above is hard to believe considering his answer to another question when he said &quot;it was before beating that my statement was taken&quot;</p>

<p>this no doubt suggest that he (2nd accused) was not tortured at all before his statement was recorded and therefore cannot complain of his statement not being voluntarily made.</p>

<p>(b) the 3rd accused (DW2 Yusuf Nurudeen) on how his statement was recorded said: &quot;My statement was taken in a small room.... there was a small window but locked and there was light while the door was left unlocked.&quot;</p>

<p>The Court below critically looked into the above observations of the trial Court and nevertheless held thus:</p>

<p>&quot;In any event, these.... Observations on which the issue is predicted are mere comments that are miles away from being classified as the rationes (sic) decidendi of that trial-within-trial proceedings at worst they came squarely within the realm of obiter dicta.&quot;</p>

<p>As rightly observed, by the Court below, the comments made by the trial Court at the trial -within-trial proceedings were mere obiter dicta. It is common place that an orbiter dictum is an expression of opinion made in a giving statement by the Judge, but not necessary to his decision and as such cannot form part of the ratio decidendi of the Judgment. In other words an orbiter dictum of a Court does not have the status of a ratio decidendi; it does not decide the live issue in the matter; a ratio decidendi does: see Oshodi V. Eyifunmi (2000) 7SC (Pt II) 145 and Orgbo V. Una (2002) 9-10 SC 61.</p>

<p>The ratio decidendi in this case not predicated on the inadmissibility of the Appellants' statements to the police in Exhibits 4, 5 and 6. I do not see how those passing remarks uttered by the learned trial Judge could offend the Appellants' right to presumption of innocence as enshrined in section 36 of the 1999 Constitution.</p>

<p>It is instructive to note that those passing comments were made at the trial within trial proceedings with its own peculiarities and circumstances, and is an independent and distinct trial. A trial will entail due examination of witnesses or documents placed before a Court or both; the truth of a point or questions in dispute; and finally the finding fact or applicable law is pronounced in a Judgment. Suffices it to say that the comments of the learned trial Judge was made in relation to his findings in trial-within- trial, which in itself is a complete trial.</p>

<p>To ascribe bias to the learned trial Judge because of those comments he had made during trial within trial is certainly unfair.</p>

<p>The evidence led by the prosecution against the accused persons is cogent and compelling. Appellant could not deny any of the direct incriminating evidence of the prosecution witnesses. The evidence led by the prosecution left the trial Judge to irresistibly conclude that prosecution had proved its case. In paragraphs 3.41 - 3.42 of their brief of argument, the 2nd and 3rd Appellants argued extensively that the evidence of PWI and PW3 should also have been expunged from the record in view of the excision of Exhibits 4, 5 and 6 by the lower Court and that evidence of PW3 alone was not sufficient in the circumstance to secure the conviction of the appellants. There is no merit in this argument. PWI was the Exhibit keeper, who merely tendered Exhibits 1 (life red cartridge), Exhibit 2 (locally made pistol), Exhibit 3 (bond dated 5/11/2007) Exhibit 4 (Confessional statement of 2nd Appellant) and Exhibit 5 (Confessional statement of 3rd Appellant) and nothing more. He kept custody of these items recorded by PW2 (IPO). Their evidence was not based on the expunged Exhibits, but on their respective actions and findings in the course of investigation, particularly PW2 (the IPO). Their evidence, therefore are admissible and corroborative of the evidence of the victim (PW3).</p>

<p>On page 95 of the record PW2 gave detailed and sufficient account of what he saw and observed at the scene of crime. In continuation of his evidence he stated on that page thus:</p>

<p>&quot;I visited the scene of crime with both complainant and accused persons. At the scene of crime I discovered that the house of the 3rd accused is very close to the house of the complainant, corroborating the evidence of the statement of the 1st accused that the 3rd accused withdraw (sic) to avoid recognition. The 2nd accused took us to where he abandoned the bag collected from the victim when he was running away.</p>

<p>I was also shown where they were standing when the complainant was being dropped on a motor cycle in front of her house. My investigation revealed that the 3rd accused person did rob the complainant on gun point. It also revealed that while running away the 1st accused shot the gun. Consequent upon this prudent investigation the accused persons were arraigned before the Court.&quot;</p>

<p>These pieces of evidence of PW2 were neither denied nor rebutted by any of the Appellants in the course of their defence. In law these evidence are deemed compelling and credible and the Courts below were right to have acted on them.</p>

<p>In view of the foregoing I resolve this issue in favor of the Respondent.</p>

<p>On the second issue, the Appellants in their respective briefs submitted that there was no agreement on the part of the Appellants to do an illegal act, to wit, rob PW3 at the scene of Crime. This submission, with due respect to their learned Counsel is erroneous and baseless.</p>

<p>The learned trial Judge found on this issue, on pages 120 of the Record thus:</p>

<p>&quot;On the charge of criminal conspiracy, can it be said that the three accused persons agreed to rob and that each of them participated in the act of armed robbery? Realizing the fact that it may not always be easy to prove the actual agreement, Courts usually consider it sufficient if it be established by evidence of circumstances, from which the Courts would consider it safe and reasonable to infer the proof of criminal conspiracy charge.&quot;</p>

<p>On page 122 the learned trial Judge found thus:</p>

<p>&quot;I therefore find as a fact that the accused Persons conspired to rob PW3 and they are convicted having found them guilty as charged.&quot;</p>

<p>Dealing with the same issue the Court below found also at pages 247 - 248 of the record thus:</p>

<p>&quot;Against the background of these Elements of criminal conspiracy, did the prosecution establish the offence against the Appellants? At dawn of examination- in- chief of PW3 she testified as follows:</p>

<p>&#96;I know the accused persons on 18/8/2007 at about 9.30pm; I was coming from my shop to my house when I took a motor bike home, being ridden by a motor cyclist. As I came down on the motor cycle, I moved 2 (two) steps on the stair case and I saw the attackers with gun pointed at me. They asked if I will surrender my bag with money or my life the people who attacked me are the accused persons standing trial. They snatched the bag from me and I started shouting as I ran to the door. ...It was the 1st accused who was first arrested before he mentioned the names of the other persons' (underlining mine).</p>

<p>The foregoing passages are the two concurrent findings of the two Courts below, and are unassailable. I can not disturb these findings as they are not perverse.</p>

<p>The offence of criminal conspiracy is defined in section 96 of the Penal Code Law, Cap. P4, Laws of Kwara State of Nigeria, 2006 thus:</p>

<p>&quot;96 (1) - when two or more persons agree to do or cause to be done</p>

<p>(a) An illegal act, or</p>

<p>(b) An act which is not illegal by Illegal means,...&quot;</p>

<p>The offence of criminal conspiracy is sustained by leading evidence from which the Court can deduce inference of certain criminal acts of the person accused, done in pursuance of criminal purpose. It can be inferred from the attainment of common end. The conspirators need not to know themselves or to be in direct communication in respect of the offence charged.</p>

<p>The Court can infere Conspiracy from the criminal acts of the parties including of complicity. The evidence of PW3 is clear as regards the way and manner she was robbed by the Appellants. Appellants, in the circumstance, cannot be heard that the offence of Conspiracy was not established. From the pieces of evidence of PW3, particularly the underlined they had an agreement to attack her and they did dispose her of her bag. The pieces of evidence are unchallenged and uncontroverted.</p>

<p>The Appellants in their respective arguments in their briefs contended that the evidence of PW3 on how the 1st accused was arrested and how he mentioned the names of the two other persons amounted to hearsay in law.</p>

<p>I agree with the learned counsel for the Respondent that the learned counsel for the Appellants failed to appreciate the position of evidence before the trial Court. PW3, the victim of the robbery in her evidence said &quot;It was the 1st accused who was first arrested before he mentioned the names of the other accused persons.&quot; PW3 having been confronted by the Appellants before running away had positively identified them from the rear light in front of her house. Also the identification of Exhibit 2 (the gun) by PW3 cannot by any stretch of imagination amount to hear say evidence against the background that she was attacked and dispossessed of her bag. PW3 vividly narrated her ordeal in the hands of the Appellants based on what she knows, saw, perceived, experienced and suffered directly. Such evidence could not amount to hearsay in law.</p>

<p>The burden of proof of the guilt of the accused person beyond reasonable doubt by the prosecution in criminal cases should not be taken to mean that the prosecution must sustain its case beyond every shadow of doubt. Once the prosecutor has been able to prove that an offence has been committed and that no person other than the accused committed the offence, the prosecution is said to have established its case beyond reasonable doubt, see Miller V. Minister of Pension (1947) 2 ALLER 371 at 373. Lori V. The State (1980) 8-11 SC 81 at 99; Akalezi V. The State (1993) 2NWLR (Pt 273) 1 at 13 and Emeila V. The State (2001) 6 SC. 227.</p>

<p>In view of the foregoing reasons and the detailed ones in the lead Judgment, I also find no merit in this appeal. I too dismiss the appeal.</p>

<p>I have read in draft the lead judgment of my learned brother, Kekere-Ekun, JSC. I adopt the lucid and exhaustive reasoning and conclusion reached and based on same; I also dismiss the appeal for want of merit.</p>
