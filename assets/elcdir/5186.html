<p>ISSUES</p>

<p>1. Whether, having made intention to defraud an element of the offences charged, the prosecution was bound to prove that element in the brief of the decision of the Supreme Court in Agumadu V. The Queen (1963) 1 All NLR 203 to the effect that the onus is upon the prosecution to prove the offence as charged irrespective of the provisions of the statute creating the offence and if so whether their lordships of the court below were wrong to holding that because the statute creating various offences did not make intention to defraud an element of the offences charged, the prosecution was not bound to prove that element even though it was made an element of the offences charged and in spite of the fact that the Appellants were thereby gravely prejudiced. (Arising from ground 1 of the grounds of Appeal).</p>

<p>2. Whether their lordships of the court below failed to consider at all or to consider adequately the defence of the appellants and numerous fundamental contradictions in the case of the prosecution which case grave doubt on the guilt of the Appellant and showed that the case of the prosecution had not been proved beyond reasonable doubt. (Arising from ground 7 of the grounds of Appeal).</p>

<p>3. Whether the learned Justices of the court below erred in law when they affirmed the decision of the learned trial Judge to the effect that the prosecution prove, beyond reasonable doubt. The allegation of conspiracy to disobey lawful orders contained in count 8 of the amended information in spite of the fact that there was no evidence whatsoever that the appellant had met to achieve a criminal objective and in spite of the failure of the prosecution to prove the elements of that offence as charged. (Arising from ground 2 of the grounds of Appeal).</p>

<p>4. Whether the learned Justices of the court below erred in law when they affirmed the decision of the learned trial judge to the effect that the prosecution prove, beyond reasonable doubt, the charge of disobedience of lawful orders made in counts 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 19, 20 - 44, 46, 49 and 50 - 57 of the amended information, in spite of the fact that the ingredients of the offences charged were not proved. (Arising from grounds 55, 6 and 8 of the grounds of Appeal).</p>

<p>5. Whether the learned Justices of the court below erred in law in affirming the decision of the learned trial Judge that the Prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt, the allegations contained in counts 59, 60, 61, 64, 65 and 67 of the amended information that the appellant abused the authority of their offices by splitting contracts in spite of the fact that virtually all the prosecution witnesses testified either that no contracts were split or that if contracts were split at all they were not split by the appellant as the contracts all originated from the management of the authority and were awarded exactly in the form in which they were presented. (Arising from ground 4 of the grounds of appeal).</p>

<p>6. Whether the learned Justices of the court below erred in law when they affirmed the decision of the learned trial Judge in relying on Section 7 of the Criminal Code to convict the appellant (Arising from ground 3 of the grounds of Appeal).</p>

<p>7. Whether the learned Justices of the court below erred in law when they held that the trial judge had jurisdiction to try the Appellants on the charges on which they were convicted in spite of the fact that the charges were laid under the wrong law. (Arising from grounds 9 and 10 of the grounds of Appeal).</p>

<p>8. whether the learned Justices of the Court of Appeal erred in law in holding that there was a valid delegation of prosecutorial powers from the Attorney-General of Lagos State to the Attorney-General of the Federation and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission who in turn were alleged to have delegated their authority to Festus Keyamo, a private Legal Practitioner to take over and continue the prosecution initiated by the Attorney - General of the Federation. (Arising from grounds 11,12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 of the grounds of Appeal).</p>

<p>FACTS</p>

<p>The appellant was arraigned before the High Court of Justice Lagos State on the 8th of August, 2008 on a 163 count information. The charges were all read and explained to each and everyone of the accused persons. All of them pleaded not guilty. Later the prosecution reduced the charges and came up with 68 counts on 24/10/2008. Again the Appellant and other accused persons pleaded not guilty to the 68 counts - charge.</p>

<p>The alleged offences against the Appellant and others in the trial court are mainly conspiracy.</p>

<p>It appears that ten (10) witnesses testified for the prosecution. They were duly cross-examined and re-examined. The prosecution also tendered 20 Exhibits. The 1st defendant Chief Olabode George testified for the defence and tendered nine (9) Exhibits.</p>

<p>Learned counsel for both the prosecution and defence addressed the High Court. After the conclusion of the counsel addresses in a reserved judgment Hon. Justice J. O. K. Oyewole delivered his judgment on 26th day of October, 2009. The trial court found that some of the counts were not proved against the appellant and other accused persons and acquitted and discharged the appellant. However the trial court found that some of the charges were proved by the prosecution and found the appellant guilty. The appellant was convicted for those charges proved and sentenced accordingly.</p>

<p>Aggrieved by the decision of the trial High Court the Appellant herein with others unsuccessfully appealed to the Court of Appeal Lagos Division herein after referred to as court below. The Appellant herein, Engineer Sule Aliyu, filed a Notice of Appeal containing nine grounds of appeal.</p>

<p>HELD (Unanimously Allowing the Appeal)</p>

<p>1. On Duty on the Prosecution to prove Intention where it made Intention an Element of the Offence Charged.</p>

<p>The learned counsel to the respondent alleged that all the counts of the information charged were committed with INTENT TO DEFRAUD. But one will be amazed and disappointed to discover that throughout the trial the prosecution was not able to prove that intent to defraud by evidence. There was no shred of evidence indicating that intention after closely analysing the submissions of both counsel and the record of proceedings, I hold that, without much ado, that there was no evidence adduced to support the existence of intention to defraud against the appellant. The position of the law is that the prosecution must prove the offences as charged irrespective of the provisions of the statute creating the offence. Since the prosecution in this case made &quot;intention to defraud&quot; an element of the offence charged they must go ahead to prove by evidence that element. The prosecution cannot be heard to state otherwise. M. S. Muntaka-Coomassie, JSC at Page 570.</p>

<p>2. On when the Supreme Court will interfere with Concurrent findings of two Lower Courts.</p>

<p>I hold in a nutshell that the trial court judgment was wrongly delivered. There was no iota of evidence to support the conviction and sentence. The court below unfortunately affirmed that wrong decision. The decision of the court below being perverse the Supreme Court is entitled to interfere with both decisions of the two lower courts. M. S. Muntaka-Coomassie, JSC at Page 571.</p>

<p>3. On Validity of Convictions for a wrong for which there is no Penal Sanction in a written Law.</p>

<p>None of the offence of Abuse of office by splitting contracts, disobedience to lawful orders and conspiracy to disobey lawful orders were proved by evidence some of the offences charged were never defined by any law codifying same and no where can one trace where the punishments thereof were prescribed. The said disobedience, if any of a ministerial directive in Exhibit P3, is not and cannot be an offence contained in a written and or codified in a written law for which punishment is prescribed in the same written law as enjoined by Section 36 (12) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as amended. I think when the provision of Section 203 and of the Criminal Code is juxtaposed it would be clear that it is a direct affront to the provisions of Section 36 (12) of the 1999 Constitution.</p>

<p>Consequently there is no where disobedience to Exhibit P3 (new guidelines) is penalised or codified in a written law. The so called offence of disobedience to lawful order is therefore non-existence and assuming, without conceding, that it exists, no punishment was prescribed against the offenders. The conviction and sentence of two years imprisonment dished out against the Appellant are nullities. M. S. Muntaka-Coomassie, JSC at Pages 571 - 572.</p>

<p>4. On Effect of Provisions of Statutes that are inconsistent with the Provision of the Constitution.</p>

<p>Both Section 203 and 104 of the Criminal Code were inconsistent with the provisions of the 1999 Constitution that makes both Sections unconstitutional. M. S. Muntaka-Coomassie, JSC at Page 572.</p>

<p>5. Notable Pronouncement.</p>

<p>It is, I think rudimentary and elementary for anybody or persons having something to do with the dispensation of justice in this country to know that no citizen can be made to face any criminal trial for an act which is not qualified as offence, not defined or stated (codified) in any law and punishment thereof prescribed. All courts, so named, cannot claim ignorance of these facts. The trial therefore ab initio was not right. The trial, conviction and sentences meted out against the Appellant, are null and void. The conviction is simply un-warranted; No iota of legal evidence was adduced against any of the accused persons not to talk about lawful trial.</p>

<p>I must therefore, regrettably condemn the attitude of both the prosecution and the lower courts for allowing these unrealistic trial and convictions to happen. M. S. Muntaka-Coomassie, JSC at Page 573.</p>

<p>6. On when the Supreme Court will interfere with Concurrent findings of two Lower Courts.</p>

<p>The judgment was absolutely un-maintainable. That being the case, the said two concurrent decisions of the lower courts cannot possibly be sustained. This court would be failing in its sacred duty if it does not quickly disturb the findings of facts of the two lower Courts. The appeal against the judgment of the lower court is allowed without any regret. M. S. Muntaka-Coomassie, JSC at Page 574.</p>

<p>LEAD JUDGMENT As Delivered By</p>

<p>MUHAMMAD S. MUNTAKA-COOMASSIE, JSC.</p>

<p>The Appellant herein Engineer Sule Aliyu now before this court on appeal was appointed a member of the Board of Directors of Nigerian Ports Authority. The Board on which the appellant served was in office from 2001 - 2003.</p>

<p>In any reputable organisation there shall be guidelines to assist it achieve its goals. In the Authority there are guidelines in use until 12th day of November, 2002 when Alhaji W. M. Kurawa, who was the representative of the Ministry of Transport on the Board announced the existence of Exhibit P3, the new guideline for the award of contracts by the authority. This representative is now Pw4 allowed sometime until when all the contracts listed for award had been awarded before he drew the attention of the Chairman and Board members. This revelation was made known to the Court of Appeal but that court fails to take that fact into consideration. This new guidelines was supposed to be in writing but alas this time around there was no such written correspondence. Thirdly, the said Exhibit Pw3 was the photocopy of a document which bore the stamp of the Ministry of Water Resources and not that of the Ministry of Transport which document appeared to have been received by the Ministry of Water Resources even before it came into being. The Authority as it were continuing using the valid and reliable guideline and ignored the so called new guideline pending further clarification on the new guideline Exhibit D4 so far, can one lawfully say that the continued use of the existing guideline there was a conspiracy by the appellant and Minister's representative? Or better still can one say that the action of the Appellant Engineer Sule Aliyu, amounts to disobedience to the lawful order by the Appellant and Pw4?</p>

<p>The appellant was arraigned before the High Court of Justice Lagos state on the 8th of August, 2008 on a 163 count information. The charges were all read and explained to each and everyone of the accused persons. All of them pleaded not guilty. Later the prosecution reduced the charges and came up with 68 counts on 24/10/2008. Again the Appellant and other accused persons pleaded not guilty to the 68 counts - charge.</p>

<p>The alleged offences against the Appellant and others in the trial court are mainly conspiracy.</p>

<p>It appears that ten (10) witnesses testified for the prosecution. They were duly cross-examined and re-examined. The prosecution also tendered 20 Exhibits. The 1st defendant Chief Olabode George testified for the defence and tendered nine (9) Exhibits.</p>

<p>Learned counsel for both the prosecution and defence addressed the High Court. After the conclusion of the counsel addresses, in a reserved judgment Hon. Justice J. O. K. Oyewole delivered his judgment on 26th day of October, 2009. The trial court found that some of the counts were not proved against the appellant and other accused persons and acquitted and discharged the appellant. However the trial court found that some of the charges were proved by the prosecution and found the appellant guilty. The appellant was convicted for those charges proved and sentenced accordingly.</p>

<p>On page 1736 of volume 5 of the record of proceedings the learned trial judge state thus:-</p>

<p>&quot;In totality therefore, I find each of the defendants not guilty on counts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 13; 14, 17, 18, 30, 31, 45, 47, 48, 58, 62, 63, 66 and 68, respectively and I hereby discharge and acquit each of them on each of those counts. While I find each of the defendants guilty as charged on each of count 8, 9, 10,11,12, 15, 16, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 59, 60, 61, 64, 65 and 67 respectively and I hereby convict each one of them of the said counts respectively&quot;.</p>

<p>Aggrieved by the decision of the trial High Court the Appellant herein with others unsuccessfully appealed to the Court of Appeal, Lagos Division herein after referred to as court below. The Appellant herein, Engineer Sule Aliyu, filed a Notice of Appeal containing nine grounds of appeal.</p>

<p>The court below was full of praises for the learned trial Judge for doing an excellent job. On pages 95 - 96 the court below in affirming the trial court's decision and dismissing the appellant's appeal has this to say:-</p>

<p>&quot;The findings and conclusions arrived at by the learned trial Judge supra, is analytical, critical, revealing as well as being through to the point of not leaving any stone unturned. The inadequacy and deficiency of the cross appellant's evidence in providing the ingredient in question is self defeating and this had been clearly sunshine printed by the learned trial judge in his judgment. I endorse the findings which l find as unassailable.</p>

<p>The evidence tendered during the trial that all the investigations were carried out in 2005 even though it was to cover the period 2001 - 2003. Exhibit P1 relating to the prices for &quot;period under review is not sufficient. The absence of anything tendered or presented by the Respondents to the cross-appeal during cross-examination or during their case in rebuttal of the evidence is immaterial. The argument by the cross appellant in that behalf is of no moment. The board approves but does not fix prices but the user department. This charge is distinguishable from the splitting contract situation especially having regard to Exhibit P3 the Financial Limit, which was held to be within the knowledge of the cross respondents but nevertheless deliberately refused to obey and thereby conspired to side tract a lawful order. Exhibits D1; D2 and D3 also confirm Exhibit P3 and makes it remarkably distinguishable from the charge the subject of review.</p>

<p>The learned trial judge has in a nutshell said it all and I will therefore say no more. The cross appeal at hand is devoid of any merit and it is dismissed while the conclusion arrived at by the lower court in discharging and acquitting the appellants on counts 1-7 of the amended information dealing with inflation of contracts prices contrary to Section 22 (3) of the Corrupt Practices and other Related Offences Act, 2000 is affirmed. The cross appeal is therefore dismissed.</p>

<p>On the totality of the main appeal by the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th appellants it is devoid of any merit and is hereby dismissed, in the same vein the cross-appeal by the cross-appellant also fails and is dismissed.</p>

<p>The judgment of the lower court delivered on 26th October, 2009 by Honourable Justice Oyewole of the High Court Lagos State, Ikeja Division is hereby affirmed.&quot;</p>

<p>The above is clearly the unanimous decisions of the court below. The appellant with others were dissatisfied with that judgment of the court below and appealed to the Supreme Court of Nigeria on a Notice of Appeal containing sixteen (16) grounds of appeal.</p>

<p>The appellant herein Engineer Sule Aliyu was one of the six (6) accused persons arraigned before J. O. K. Oyewole J. He pleaded not guilty. The trial court as revealed by the records of proceeding had found the appellant and others guilty, convicted and sentenced the Appellant and others to two years imprisonment. The appellant herein and others were not satisfied and appealed to the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal unanimously agreed with the trial court's decision and dismissed the appeal. I have already, in this judgment, reproduced the judgment of the court below.</p>

<p>Learned counsel for the Appellant Yinka Farounbi Esq., filed his Appellant's brief of argument which was deemed filed on 9th day of January, 2013. I have now stated the issues formulated by the appellant, Engineer Sule Aliyu as follows:-</p>

<p>ISSUES:</p>

<p>1. Whether, having made intention to defraud an element of the offences charged, the prosecution was bound to prove that element in the brief of the decision of the Supreme Court in Agumadu V. The Queen (1963) 1 All NLR 203 to the effect that the onus is upon the prosecution to prove the offence as charged irrespective of the provisions of the statute creating the offence and if so whether their lordships of the court below were wrong in holding that because the statute creating various offences did not make intention to defraud an element of the offences charged, the prosecution was not bound to prove that element even though it was made an element of the offences charged and in spite of the fact that the Appellants were thereby gravely prejudiced. (Arising from ground 1 of the Grounds of Appeal).</p>

<p>2. Whether their lordships of the court below failed to consider at all or to consider adequately the defence of the appellants and numerous fundamental contradictions in the case of the prosecution which cause grave doubt on the guilt of the Appellant and showed that the case of the prosecution had not been proved beyond reasonable doubt. (Arising from ground 7 of the Grounds of Appeal).</p>

<p>3. Whether the learned Justices of the court below erred in law when they affirmed the decision of the learned trial Judge to the effect that the prosecution prove, beyond reasonable doubt the allegation of conspiracy to disobey lawful orders contained in count 8 of the amended information in spite of the fact that there was no evidence whatsoever that the appellant had met to achieve a criminal objective and in spite of the failure of the prosecution to prove the elements of that offence as charged. (Arising from ground 2 of the Grounds of Appeal).</p>

<p>4. Whether the learned Justices of the court below erred in law when they affirmed the decision of the learned trial judge to the effect that the prosecution proved, beyond reasonable doubt, the charge of disobedience of lawful orders made in counts 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 19, 20 - 44, 46, 49 and 50 - 57 of the amended information, in spite of the fact that the ingredients of the offences charged were not proved. (Arising from grounds 55, 6 and 8 of the grounds of Appeal).</p>

<p>5. Whether the learned Justices of the court below erred in law in affirming the decision of the learned trial Judge that the Prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt, the allegations contained in counts 59, 60, 61, 64, 65 and 67 of the amended information that the appellant abused the authority of their offices by splitting contracts in spite of the fact that virtually all the prosecution witnesses testified either that no contracts were split or that if contracts were split at all they were not split by the appellant as the contracts all originated from the management of the authority and were awarded exactly in the form in which they were presented. (Arising from ground 4 of the grounds of appeal).</p>

<p>6. Whether the learned Justices of the court below erred in law when they affirmed the decision of the learned trial Judge in relying on Section 7 of the Criminal Code to convict the appellant (Arising from ground 3 of the grounds of Appeal).</p>

<p>7. Whether the learned Justices of the court below erred in law when they held that the trial judge had jurisdiction to try the Appellants on the charges on which they were convicted in spite of the fact that the charges were laid under the wrong law. (Arising from grounds 9 and 10 of the grounds of Appeal).</p>

<p>8. whether the learned Justices of the Court of Appeal erred in law in holding that there was a valid delegation of prosecutorial powers from the Attorney-General of Lagos State to the Attorney-General of the Federation and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission who in turn were alleged to have delegated their authority to Festus Keyamo, a private Legal Practitioner to take over and continue the prosecution initiated by the Attorney - General of the Federation. (Arising from grounds 11,12,1, 14,15 and 16 of the grounds of Appeal).</p>

<p>The respondent adopted its brief of argument and formulated three (3) issues thus:-</p>

<p>1. Whether the High Court of Lagos State had the requisite jurisdiction to try the Appellant for the offences for which they were convicted (grounds 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 of the Appellant's Notice of Appeal).</p>

<p>2. Whether the concurrent findings of facts of the two courts below in this case are so perverse and unsupportable by evidence so as to warrant interference by the supreme Court (Grounds 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the Appellant's Notice of Appeal).</p>

<p>3. Whether the Court of Appeal was wrong to have relied on Section 7 of the Criminal Code, Cap C17, laws of Lagos state, 2003, to uphold the conviction of the appellant (Ground 3 of the Appellant's Notice of Appeal)</p>

<p>I have gone through the arguments and issues formulated by both parties and held that there is evidence of deep research by Festus Keyamo Esq., counsel for the Respondent. However some of the submissions are misplaced as they lack cogent and acceptable evidence to back them.</p>

<p>The learned counsel to the respondent alleged that all the counts of the information charged were committed with INTENT TO DEFRAUD. But one will be amazed and disappointed to discover that throughout the trial the prosecution was not able to prove that intent to defraud by evidence. There was no shred of evidence indicating that intention after closely analysing the submissions of both counsel and the record of proceedings, I hold that, without much ado, that there was no evidence adduced to support the existence of intention to defraud against the appellant. The position of the law is that the prosecution must prove the offences as charged irrespective of the provisions of the stature creating the offence. Since the prosecution in this case made &quot;intention to defraud&quot; an element of the offence charged they must go ahead to prove by evidence that element. The prosecution cannot be heard to state otherwise- see the case of Agumadu v. The Queen (1963) 1 All NLR 203, 205 (1963) 1 SCNLR 379 or (1963) NSCC (pt. 153) at 154. See also Oguani V. Nigerian Navy (2007) 8 NWLR (pt. 1037) at 472 per Salami JCA. This case followed the Supreme Court's decision in Agumadu v. The Queen supra. That being the case, issue 1 as framed by the Appellant is resolved in his favour. The whole issue 1 therefore was answered in affirmative. The court below erred in law when they affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</p>

<p>On issue No. 2 distilled by the Appellant's counsel and response by the Respondent, I hold in a nutshell that the trial court judgment was wrongly delivered. There was no iota of evidence to support the conviction and sentence. The court below unfortunately affirmed that wrong decision. The decision of the court below being perverse the Supreme Court is entitled to interfere with both decisions of the two lower courts. I rely on the case of Igala v. Okusin (2010) 10 NWLR (pt. 1128) 378. However in the appeal at hand, the two courts improperly handled the matter. The evidence placed before the two courts were not sufficient to ground any offence charged against the appellant. None of the offence of Abuse of office by splitting contracts, disobedience to lawful orders and conspiracy to disobey lawful orders were proved by evidence some of the offences charged were never defined by any law codifying same and no where can one trace where the punishments thereof were prescribed. The said disobedience, if any of a ministerial directive in Exhibit P3, is not and cannot be an offence contained in a written and or codified in a written law for which punishment is prescribed in the same written law as enjoined by Section 36 (12) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as amended. I think when the provision of Section 203 and of the Criminal Code is juxtaposed it would be clear that it is a direct affront to the provisions of Section 36 (12) of the 1999 Constitution.</p>

<p>Consequently there is no where disobedience to Exhibit P3 (new guidelines) is penalised or codified in a written law. The so called offence of disobedience to lawful order is therefore non-existence and assuming, without conceding, that it exists, no punishment was prescribed against the offenders. The conviction and sentence of two years imprisonment dished out against the Appellant are nullities.</p>

<p>Having therefore considered all the issues formulated by both counsel I resolved all the issues so distilled against the respondent. The trial court, l emphasise, lacked jurisdiction to try the case ab initio, therefore trial itself, I agree was a nullity. Both Sections 203 and 104 of the Criminal Code were inconsistent with the provisions of the 1999 Constitution that makes both Sections unconstitutional.</p>

<p>Having considered the contentious arguments and submissions of both counsel in this appeal and having considered the records of proceedings I hold that:-</p>

<p>a) That there is no acceptable evidence of unjust enrichment, fraud or stealing of public funds against the Appellant. The prosecution simply did not adduce any reliable evidence to prove any of the alleged offences. The appellant is merely a Director in a Federal Parastatal he is therefore never a public officer, sitting as a board member to approve or disapprove of recommendations of management, who are mainly public officers. The investigations by the prosecution agency who turned to be prosecutors could not reveal any element of fraud or corruption in the 68 court charge against the Appellant and the other accused persons, what the prosecution was able to produce against the Appellant were not offences, or criminal offences of abuse of power and disobediences of lawful orders.</p>

<p>They are in effect unconstitutional and grossly in-appropriate which can never be termed as criminal acts. Where in our constitution or law does the so call splitting of contracts become an offence? Where was it defined and where punishment for such so called offences prescribed? There is none at the time the Appellant was tried and convicted. The Appellant could not have been tried for contravening of the local laws of Lagos State unless and until he was charged with &quot;theft&quot; (Stealing) or &quot;affray&quot;. There must be a specific offence known to law and punishable by the Criminal Procedure Code (C.P.C.) or Criminal Procedure Act - (C.P.A.) it is really not right to say that the Appellant was charged for disobedience to &quot;a Federal order&quot; splitting a Federal contract not the contract of Lagos State Government and at the same time &quot;abusing his authority as a Director in a Federal Parastatal&quot;. This can never happen. It is, I think rudimentary and elementary for anybody or persons having something to do with the dispensation of justice in this country to know that no citizen can be made to face any criminal trial for an act which is not qualified as offence not defined or stated (codified) in any law and punishment thereof prescribed. All courts, so named, cannot claim ignorance of these facts. The trial therefore ab initio was not right. The trial, conviction and sentences meted out against the Appellant, are null and void. The conviction is simply un-warranted; No iota of legal evidence was adduced against any of the accused persons not to talk about lawful trial.</p>

<p>I must therefore, regrettably condemn the attitude of both the prosecution and the lower courts for allowing these unrealistic trial and convictions to happen. The appeal therefore is heavily pregnant with a lot of merits and must be allowed.</p>

<p>The Appellant Engineer Sule Aliyu has no business appearing before the Lagos State High Court. That Court simply lacked jurisdiction to try the Appellant. That Court should have declined jurisdiction. The trial and conviction/sentences are therefore null and void. The decisions of the lower Courts' judgment cannot be saved. There is no evidence of conspiracy to commit any offence.</p>

<p>The judgment was absolutely un-maintainable. That being the case, the said two concurrent decisions of the lower courts cannot possibly be sustained. This court would be failing in its sacred duty if it does not quickly disturb the findings of facts of the two lower Courts. The appeal against the judgment of the lower court is allowed without any regret.</p>

<p>The judgment of the Court below in which judgment of the trial High Court was affirmed cannot stand and it is hereby set aside. The conviction and sentence of the Appellant Engineer sule Aliyu, by the Lagos State High Court are hereby quashed. The Appellant is accordingly discharged and acquitted instantly of the said offences.</p>

<p>Appeal allowed.</p>

<p>MAHMUD MOHAMMED, JSC</p>

<p>I have read before today the judgment just delivered by my learned brother Muntaka-Coomassie, JSC. I entirely agree with him that this appeal is meritorious and therefore deserves to succeed. Accordingly, I also allow the appeal. The conviction and sentence of two years imprisonment without option of fine passed on the Appellant by the trial Court and affirmed by the Court of Appeal, are hereby set aside. In place of the conviction and sentence there shall be substituted an order acquitting and discharging the Appellant.</p>

<p>JOHN AFOLABI FABIYI, JSC</p>

<p>I have had a preview of the judgment just delivered by my learned brother - Muntaka-Coomassie, JSC. I agree with the pungent reasons therein advanced to arrive at the conclusion that the appeal is meritorious and should be allowed.</p>

<p>I seek leave to adopt the reasons adumbrated in the lead judgment in allowing the appeal. I join my brother in setting aside the judgment of the court below. The appellant is hereby acquitted and discharged forthwith.</p>

<p>NWALI SYLVESTER NGWUTA, JSC</p>

<p>I read in draft the lead judgment just delivered by my learned brother, Muntaka-Coomassie, JSC and I agree with the views expressed therein.</p>

<p>Appellant is one of the six accused who were tried and convicted and sentenced to terms of imprisonment by the High Court of Lagos State. They filed a single appeal in the Court of Appeal. The said Court dismissed their joint appeal. Before the Supreme Court, each filed a separate appeal. In the six separate appeals, the issues and arguments are the same. This being the case, I adopt my reasoning in my lead judgment in SC.182/2012 and my contributions in SC.180/2012, SC. 176/2012 and based on the same and the more comprehensive reasoning in the lead judgment of my learned brother, Muntaka-Coomassie, JSC, I also allow the appeal and set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal affirming the judgment of the trial Court. Appeal allowed. Appellant acquitted and discharged.</p>

<p>KUMAI BAYANG AKAAHS, JSC</p>

<p>My learned brother, Muntaka-Coomassie, JSC obliged me in advance with a copy of his judgement. I agree that there is merit in the appeal and it is hereby allowed. The conviction and sentence are set aside. There was no justifiable reason for putting the appellant on trial.</p>

<p>(APPEAL ALLOWED)</p>
