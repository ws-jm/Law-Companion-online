(3)	There shall be an Executive Secretary to the Board who shall be a public officer in the Federal Ministry of Commerce.

2.	Price Control Committees

(1)	There shall continue to be for each State a Committee to be known as the Price Control Com-mittee.

(2)	The Committee in each State shall consist of—

(а)	the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Trade and Industries of the State, who shall be chairman of the Committee and State Price Controller;

(б)	the Commissioner of Police for the State, or his representative;

(3)	The representative in the State of the Federal Ministry of Commerce, shall be the secretary to the Committee.

(4)	It shall be the principal function of the Committee to advise and assist the Board on the imple-mentation of this Act in the State for which the Committee is established.

(5)	If in any State any office mentioned in subsection (2) above does not exist, the paragraph in question shall be construed as referring to the office which in the opinion of the Governor most nearly corresponds to the office so mentioned.

(b)	fix the permitted variation for the commodity in respect of any State in accordance with sub-section (3) of this section.

(2)	The basic price is the price which in the opinion of the Board properly represents—

(a)	in the case of goods produced in Nigeria, the cost of production of the commodity plus the manufacturer’s profit; and

(b)	in the case of imported goods, the duty-paid landed cost in Nigeria plus the importer’s profit.

(3)	The permitted variation, in relation to any particular commodity, is the amount representing transport and other costs plus the distributor’s profit which in the opinion of the Board ought properly to be added to the basic price in order to represent a fair controlled price (wholesale or retail, as the case may be) in any State.

6.	Prohibition of sale above controlled price

(1)	If shall be unlawful for any person to sell, agree to sell or offer to sell any or employ any other person, whether or not that other person is of full age, to sell any controlled commodity at a price which exceeds the controlled price.

(ii)	in the case of a manufacturer, wholesaler or major distributor, be liable to a fine of not less than ₦1,000 and not more than ₦10,000, or to imprisonment for not less than twelve months, or to both such fine and imprisonment; and

(b)	the stock of the controlled commodity shall be liable to forfeiture.

(3)	Where a person is convicted of any offence under subsection (2) of this section in respect of any commodity the court shall make an order forfeiting the stock of the commodity; and, where such an order is made, the commodity shall be disposed of by the Board as it thinks fit, any proceeds of the dis-posal being paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Federation.

(4)	Where proceedings under subsection (2) of this section do not result in conviction the court shall make an order for the disposal at the controlled price of any commodity to which the proceedings relate and the proceeds of such disposal shall be applied as follows—
