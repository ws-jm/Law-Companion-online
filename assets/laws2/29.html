[Date of commencement: 10th April, 1972]

1.	The Comptroller-General and his staff

There shall be in the civil service of the Federation a Comptroller-General, who shall have the general charge and superintendence of the prisons system in Nigeria to be known as the 'Nigerian Prisons Service”, and such officers subordinate to the Comptroller-General as may be necessary for the proper operation of the service.

2.	Establishment and classification of prisons

(1)	The Minister may, by order in the Federal Gazette, declare any building or place in Nigeria to be a prison and by the same or a subsequent order specify the area for which the prison is established.

(2)	Every prison shall include—

(a)	the grounds and buildings within the prison enclosure; and

(b)	any lock-up house for the temporary detention or custody of prisoners newly apprehended or under remand which is declared by the Minister by order in the Federal Gazette to be part of the prison.

(3)	Subject to subsection (4) of this section, every prison shall be a prison for the imprisonment of prisoners of every description.

(4)	The Minister may, for effecting the separation of classes of prisoners or for the training of any class of prisoner or for any other purpose, by order in the Federal Gazette appropriate any prison or part of a prison to particular classes of prisoners; and any prisoner of the class to which any prison or part of a prison has been appropriated may lawfully be conveyed thereto and imprisoned therein, whether or not the warrant or order for his imprisonment has been issued by a court having jurisdiction in the place where the prison is situated.

3.	Legal custody of prisoners

(1)	Subject to subsection (2) of this section, every prisoner confined in a prison shall be deemed to be in the legal custody of the superintendent, and shall be subject to prison discipline and regulations made under this Act whether or not he is within the precincts of the prison.

(2)	In the case of a prisoner under sentence of death, the superintendent shall, at such time on the day on which the sentence is to be carried out as may be fixed by the sheriff, hand over the legal cus-tody of the prisoner to the sheriff, and from that time until the actual carrying out of the sentence—

(a)	the prisoner shall be in the legal custody of the sheriff; and

(b)	the sheriff shall have jurisdiction and control over that portion of the prison where the pris-oner is confined and the prison officers serving therein so far as may be necessary for the safe custody of the prisoner during that period and for the purpose of carrying out the sen-tence and for any purpose relating thereto. 

(3)	Subject to this Act, every superintendent is authorised and required to keep and detain all per-sons duly committed to his custody by any court, judge, magistrate, justice of the peace or other author-ity lawfully exercising civil or criminal jurisdiction, according to the terms of any warrant or order by which any such person has been committed, until that person is discharged by due course of law.

4.	Hard labour

(1)	Subject to this section, the effect of a sentence of imprisonment with hard labour passed upon a prisoner shall be that the prisoner shall be imprisoned for the period of the sentence and during his im-prisonment shall work at such labour as may be directed by the superintendent.

(2)	So far as practicable, the labour referred to in subsection (1) of this section shall take place in association or outside cells.

(3)	The medical officer may order any prisoner to be excused labour or to perform light labour, and any prisoner ordered to perform light labour shall be required to do work for which he is certified by the medical officer to be fit.

(4)	This section is without prejudice to any provision of this Act or regulations made thereunder providing for the remission of sentences.

5.	Removal of prisoners

(1)	The Comptroller-General or, if so authorised in writing by the Comptroller-General, any Assistant Director of the Nigerian Prisons Service, may by order under his hand direct that any person in prison under the sentence of a court for an offence committed by him shall be removed from die prison in which he is confined to another prison; and where a person is removed to a prison other than that named in the warrant or order together with the order of removal (which may be endorsed on or separate from the warrant or order), shall be sufficient authority—

(a)	for the removal of the prisoner to the prison named in the order of removal and his detention there; and

(b)	for the carrying out of the sentence described in the warrant or order, or for any part of the sentence which remains unexecuted.

(2)	Where it appears to the Comptroller-General—

(a)	that the number of prisoners in a prison is greater than can conveniently be kept there and that it is not convenient to transfer the excess number of prisoners to another prison; or

(b)	that by reason of the outbreak within the prison of disease or for any other reason it is desir-able to provide for the temporary shelter and safe custody of any prisoners,

the Comptroller-General may by order under his hand direct that so many of the prisoners as may be indicated in the order shall be kept and detained in a building or place which is outside the prison and is specified in the order; and that building or place shall be deemed to form part of the prison for the pur-pose of this Act until the order is cancelled.

6.	Production of prisoners before courts, etc.

(1)	Where the presence of a prisoner is required before a court, the court may issue an order ad-dressed to the superintendent requiring the prisoner to be produced before the court in proper custody at the time and place specified in the order, and may by endorsement on the order require that person to be brought up again at any adjourned hearing.

(2)	In subsection (1) of this section, 'proper custody' means the custody of prison officers.

(3)	If a prisoner charged with an offence is brought before a court under this section, the same pro-cedure shall be followed with respect to the offence as would have been followed if he had been brought before the court on a warrant.

(4)	The Comptroller-General, if he is satisfied that it is in the public interest so to do, upon receipt of a request or subpoena that the presence of a prisoner is required at any place in Nigeria, may by writing under his hand order the prisoner to be taken to that place; and a prisoner taken from a prison in pursuance of any such order shall be kept in such custody while outside the prison as the Comptroller- General may by writing under his hand direct and, so long as he is in that custody, shall be deemed to be in lawful custody.

7.	Insanity of prisoners

(1)	Where it appears to the superintendent of a prison that a prisoner undergoing a sentence of im-prisonment or under sentence of death is of unsound mind, he shall forthwith report the matter to the Minister who—

(a)	shall appoint two or more qualified medical practitioners (one of whom may be the medical officer of the prison) to inquire into the prisoner’s soundness of mind; and

(b)	may if he thinks it necessary order the removal of the prisoner from the prison to another prison or to a hospital.

(2)	The medical practitioners appointed under subsection (1) of this section shall—

(a)	forthwith examine the prisoner and inquire as to his soundness of mind;

(b)	give their opinion therein in a written report to the Comptroller-General, who shall forward the report to the Minister; and

(c)	if they or a majority of them are of the opinion that the prisoner is of unsound mind, include a certificate to that effect in the report.

(3)	Where a prisoner into whose soundness of mind an inquiry has been ordered under subsection (1) of this section is under sentence of death, the following provisions shall apply—

(a)	the superintendent shall as soon as possible report the circumstances to the relevant authority who, on receipt of the report, shall order the execution of the sentence to be suspended until the report of the medical practitioners has been received;

(b)	if the prisoner is certified to be of unsound mind, the relevant authority shall order execution of the sentence of death to be stayed and may, by order in writing under his hand directed to the superintendent direct that the prisoner shall be removed to a suitable mental hospital;

(c)	on the making of a removal order under paragraph (b) of this subsection, the prisoner shall be removed to the mental hospital in question and, subject to the mental health laws, shall be detained there (or in any other such place to which he may be transferred) during the relevant authority’s pleasure;

(d)	if a prisoner so detained is certified by two medical practitioners to be no longer of unsound mind, the relevant authority shall make such order as seems to him to be just or, if he is satis-fied that it is proper for him to do so, may by order in writing under his hand direct that the prisoner shall be removed to prison to be dealt with according to law.

(4)	Where a person other than a prisoner under sentence of death is certified to be of unsound mind under subsection (2) of this section, the following provisions shall apply—

(a)	the Minister shall by order in writing under his hand addressed to the superintendent, direct that the prisoner shall be removed to a suitable mental hospital;

(b)	a prisoner removed to a mental hospital pursuant to an order made under paragraph (a) of this subsection shall, subject to the mental health laws, be detained therein (or in any other mental hospital to which he may be transferred) until he is certified by two medical practitio-ners to be of sound mind or until the sentence of imprisonment to which he is subject deter-mines, whichever first occurs;

(c)	if the prisoner is certified to be of sound mind, he shall by order in writing under the hand of the Minister be removed to prison to serve so much of his sentence as remains;

(d)	if the prisoner is still detained in a mental hospital when his sentence of imprisonment is about to determine, it shall be the duty of the officer in charge of the mental hospital to give such information as may be necessary under the mental health laws to secure consideration of the question whether the prisoner should be detained under those laws as a person of unsound mind from the date of the determination of his sentence.

8.	Removal of sick prisoners to hospital

(2)	So long as a prisoner removed to a hospital under subsection (1) of this section remains in the hospital, the medical superintendent or other person in charge of the hospital shall certify at the end of every month that it is in his opinion necessary that the prisoner should remain in the hospital and shall transmit this certificate to the superintendent.

(3)	The medical superintendent or other person in charge of a hospital to which a prisoner has been removed from a prison under subsection (1) of this section, if in his opinion it is no longer necessary for the prisoner to remain in the hospital, shall forward to the superintendent a certificate to that effect; and the superintendent shall thereupon cause the prisoner forthwith to be returned to the prison if the prisoner is still liable to be confined therein.

(4)	If a prisoner escapes while he is in the hospital under this section, no prison officer shall be held answerable unless the prisoner was in his personal custody.

(5)	All reasonable precautions shall be taken by the medical officers and other officers of a hospital to prevent the escape of prisoners removed there for treatment, and it shall be lawful for those officers to take such measures for preventing the escape of prisoners as may be necessary:

Provided that nothing shall be done under this subsection which is likely to be prejudicial to the health of a prisoner.

(6)	Where in view of the gravity of the offence for which a prisoner is in custody or for any other reason the superintendent considers it to be desirable to take special measures for the security of the prisoner while he is under treatment in a hospital—

(a)	the superintendent may give the prisoner into the charge of fit and proper persons (not being less than two in number) one of whom at least shall always be with the prisoner day and night, or he may place the prisoner in the charge of a military guard; and

(b)	any person or military guard in whose charge a prisoner has been placed under paragraph (a) of this subsection, shall be vested with full power and authority to do all things necessary to prevent the prisoner from escaping and shall be answerable for his safe custody until he is handed over to the superintendent on his discharge from the hospital or until his sentence ex-pires, whichever first occurs.

(7)	So far as any of the foregoing provisions of this section imposes functions upon officers or State Authorities, the functions shall not be exercised except with the consent of the State Authority in ques-tion or such other person or authority to whom the power to exercise such functions has been conferred.

9.	Discharge of prisoners

(1)	Where it appears to the Comptroller-General to be advisable in the public interest or in the in-terest of the prisoner that a prisoner undergoing a sentence of imprisonment should on discharge be sent back to the area in which he has his usual place of abode or the area in which the court which passed sentence on him has jurisdiction, the Comptroller-General may, on the expiry of the sentence, direct that the prisoner shall be sent back to either of those areas, and may further direct that all necessary and proper precautions shall be taken to ensure the prisoner’s arrival in the area in question.

(2)	If a prisoner’s sentence expires on a public holiday, he shall be discharged on the immediately preceding day or, if the immediately preceding day is also a public holiday, on the latest preceding day which is not a public holiday.

(1)	Subject to subsections (4) and (6) of this section, a prison officer may use weapons against a prisoner escaping or attempting to escape, but resort shall not be had to the use of weapons unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that he could not otherwise prevent the escape.

(3)	Subject to subsection (6) of this section, a prison officer may use weapons against a prisoner us-ing violence to the officer himself or to any other prison officer or person if the officer using the weapons has reasonable grounds to believe that he or that other officer or person, as the case may be, is in danger of life or limb or that other grievous hurt is likely to be caused to him.

(4)	Before using firearms against a prisoner under subsection (1) of this section, a prison officer shall give warning to the prisoner that he is about to fire.

(5)	No prison officer, if there is a superior officer present, may use weapons of any sort against a prisoner under subsection (2) of this section except under the orders of the superior officer.

(6)	The use of weapons under this section shall as far as possible be to disable and not to kill.

PARTI

Prisoners

Admission and discharge

2.	No person may be admitted into a prison unless accompanied by a warrant of arrest, a warrant or order of detention, or a warrant of conviction or commitment; and the superintendent shall verify that the prisoner is the person named in the warrant or order, that the crime, sentence, and date of conviction are recorded therein, and that the warrant or order bears the signature of the proper authority:

[No. 12 of 1921.]

Provided always that the child of a female prisoner may be admitted into a prison with its mother if it is at the breast and less than eighteen months old.

3.	Prisoners on admission shall be searched by persons of their own sex, apart from all other prisoners. All money, effects, and articles whatsoever, except necessary clothing, shall be taken from criminal prisoners, but nothing shall be taken from debtors and other non-criminal prisoners, except knives, weapons, articles calculated to facilitate escape, prohibited articles and money.

4.	All money, effects or articles taken from prisoners, or sent to the prison for their use, and not allowed to be received and retained by them, shall be taken charge of by the superintendent of the prison, and an inventory of them shall be made in the prison register.

5.	The name, age, height, weight, features, particular marks, and general appearance of each convicted prisoner, shall be noted in the prison register.

6.	The prisoner shall, as soon as possible, be examined by the medical officer, who shall enter in the prison register a record of the state of health of the prisoner, whether it is requisite that he should be vaccinated, and any observations which he may deem it expedient to make.

7.	The prisoner shall be cleansed in a bath, and, if a male and convicted, have his hair cut, or on the recommendation of the medical officer, closely cropped or shaved. Female prisoners shall have their hair cut only as shall be necessary for health or cleanliness.

[No. 13 of 1951.]

8.	All prisoners, prior to being removed or discharged, shall be examined by the medical officer, and no prisoner shall be discharged except at his own request, while labouring under any acute or dangerous disorder, nor until the medical officer shall certify that such discharge is safe.

9.	On the discharge of a prisoner, the clothes in which he was admitted, and any other articles he brought with him on his admission, shall be returned to him, unless it has been found necessary to destroy the clothes, in which case suitable clothing shall be provided at Government expense.

10.	No prisoner can, in consequence of misconduct while in prison, be detained in prison beyond the expiration of the term of imprisonment to which he was sentenced by a court of law, unless he has been again brought before a court of law and received a fresh sentence.

11.	Should it become expedient to release a prisoner for repatriation outside Nigeria before the expira-tion of his sentence, in order that he may take ocean or air passage on a given date, the superintendent shall make application to the Minister, through the Director of Prisons, and the Minister may at his dis-cretion sanction such release and order the prisoner’s warrant to be endorsed accordingly.

[No. 13 of 1951.]

12.	If a convict is ill in mind or body, and his life is endangered by further confinement, or his illness is likely to terminate fatally within a brief period and before the expiration of his sentence or is of such a nature as to endanger the health of other prison inmates, the superintendent and medical officer shall act in the following manner—

{a) so soon as the medical officer informs the superintendent of the prison, in writing, that a prisoner’s life is endangered by further confinement or that a prisoner’s illness is likely to terminate fatally within a brief period and before the expiration of his sentence or is of such a nature as to endanger the health of other prison inmates, the superintendent shall at once make inquiries as to the ability and willingness of the prisoner’s friends or relatives to take charge of him. If satisfied that the prisoner’s friends or relatives will take charge and care of the sick prisoner the superintendent and medical officer shall fill in a warrant of release in the form in the Schedule and forward the same through the Director of Prisons to the Minister for his decision;

(b) if the case is urgent, communication by telegraph may be resorted to. Such telegrams must state fully and definitely the grounds which necessitate the request; the prisoner’s name and number, the place of confinement, his offence, the sentence, the unexpired time, the disease from which he is suffering, the names of friends or relatives willing to look after him, the fact that life is endangered by further imprisonment, and that release will prolong life, or that the prisoner’s illness is likely to terminate fatally within a brief period and before the expiration of his sentence or is of such a nature as to endanger the health of other prison inmates (as the case may be). Immediately after the dispatch of the telegram the superintendent and medical officer will fill in a warrant of release in the form aforesaid and forward the same through the Director of Prisons to the Minister for his decision.

[No. 25 of 1918 and No. 35 of 1926.]

13.	Such release will only be sanctioned by the Minister on the condition endorsed on the warrant for release, i.e., that it does not operate as a commutation of the sentence of imprisonment passed upon the prisoner, and that, at any time during the continuance thereof, the prisoner may be arrested by warrant issued by the Minister, and committed to prison until such time as the original sentence would in due course have expired. In case release is sanctioned, under the foregoing regulation, the warrant for release, duly signed by the Minister shall be filed with the prisoner’s commitment warrant in the prison in which he was last confined.

[No. 25 of 1918.]

14.	In the case of a prisoner who is suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis or leprosy not in itself serious enough to endanger his life under suitable conditions, but liable to endanger the health of other prison inmates, the medical officer shall inform the superintendent of the prison, in writing, who shall take, without unnecessary delay, measures to carry out the recommendations of the medical officer in order to maintain the health of prisoners. In the event of the medical officer recommending the transfer of a prisoner for reasons of health, the superintendent shall forward a detailed report of the case through the Director of Prisons to the Minister for his decision.

[No. 7 of 1933.]

Separation of prisoners

15.	Male and female prisoners shall be confined in separate parts of the prison.

16.	The prisoners of each sex shall, as far as the prison accommodation renders it practicable, be divided into distinct classes, namely—

(a)	prisoners before trial shall be kept apart from convicted prisoners;

(b)	juveniles under sixteen years of age, from adults;

(c)	debtors and other non-criminal prisoners, from criminal prisoners.

[No. 23 of 1932 and No. 13 of 1951.]

17.	Prisoners for whom separate cells are not provided shall be associated in rooms, with not less than three prisoners in each room.

Liquor and tobacco

18.	No spirituous liquor shall be admitted for the use of any prisoner, and no smoking shall be allowed, or tobacco in any form introduced, except under a written order of the medical officer.

19.	Any order by medical officer for the admission of spirituous liquors or tobacco shall specify the quantity to be admitted, and the name of the prisoner for whose use it is intended, and shall be entered by him in his journal.

20.	A debtor or other non-criminal prisoner may procure or receive at proper hours moderate quantities of food, wine, malt liquor, clothing, bedding, or other necessaries, but subject to examination.

21.	A criminal prisoner before trial may provide himself with food and other necessaries in the same way as a debtor; and if he does not desire to do so, he shall receive the regular prison allowance of food.

Diet

22.	Every prisoner shall be allowed a sufficient quantity of plain and wholesome food, regard being had to the nature of the labour to be performed by him; and the following are the scales of diet to be observed—

34.	The medical officer shall, from time to time, examine the criminal prisoners under sentence of penal servitude, or imprisonment with hard labour, and shall make an entry in his journal of the physical capabilities of every such prisoner. No prisoner shall be put to any kind of employment for which the medical officer shall have certified him to be unfit until he shall certify that he is fit for such em-ployment.

35.	No prisoner shall be employed at hard labour on a Sunday, or on Christmas Day, or on Good Fri-day; except that if in the interest of public health or of the Government service, it is found necessary to employ prisoners on the days mentioned they may be so employed.

Complaints

47.	(1) Prisoners may make complaints to a prison visitor or to the superintendent (or in the case of females to the wardress) but not to any subordinate officer except to report sickness. When a prisoner wishes to make a complaint to the superintendent he should inform the warder in charge of his gang that he wishes to make a complaint. When the prisoners are locked up for the night the warder shall report to the chief warder the name and number of the prisoner who wishes to see the superintendent and the chief warder shall arrange to parade the prisoner before the superintendent on the following morning, except when the following day falls on Sunday in which case he should be paraded on the Monday following.

[No. 35 of 1926.]

(d) in aggravated cases, to undergo any two of the above punishments for the same offence:

Provided that no sentence of two of the prescribed punishments for the same offence imposed by one visitor of prisons other than the Minister, the Attorney-General of the Federation, the Inspector- General of Police, the Deputy Governor of a State shall be executed unless and until it has been con-firmed by the Governor of the State except in cases where the visitor imposing the sentence is of opinion that the immediate execution of the sentence is necessary in the interests of discipline and in such case such sentence may by special order of such visitor be executed without such confirmation but in every such case the visitor making such special order shall record the reasons for making such order at the same time that the order is made and shall forward to the Governor a report on the case setting out the reasons for making such special order.

50.	(1) Where a person has been ordered to receive the punishment of whipping for any offence under regulation 48 of these Regulations, if the punishment is awarded under regulation 49 (1) of these Regu-lations not more than six strokes and if the punishment is awarded under regulation 49 (2) of these Regulations not more than twelve strokes shall be inflicted, and no prisoner shall be whipped twice for the same offence, nor be sentenced at any time to more than one whipping nor be whipped again until an interval of at least fourteen days shall have elapsed since the last whipping.

They shall give such orders for preventing injury to health as they may deem necessary, and may order the punishment to be discontinued at any time. Nothing in this or any other regulation shall be deemed to authorise the pun-ishment by whipping of any female prisoner, or of any prisoner under civil process.

51.	In cases of escaping from lawful custody, and in every case where it appears that the offence by reason of its gravity, or by reason of previous offences, would not be adequately punished under the preceding sections, the accused may be tried by a court and dealt with under the Criminal Code.

[Cap. C38J

52.	The superintendent of the prison shall enter in the record of punishments a statement of the date and nature of every offence punished under these Regulations, with the name of the offender and the punishment inflicted.

(c)	every forfeiture of the right to remission of sentence by a prisoner shall be supported by an entry in the prisoner’s punishment book.

[No. 24 of 1940.]

58.	Cumulative sentences, when imposed at the same time, together amounting to the minimum term of imprisonment prescribed by regulation 54 of these Regulations shall entitle a prisoner to be eligible for remission of sentence for the whole period of such sentences.

59.	Cumulative sentences when passed at different times, together amounting to the minimum term of imprisonment prescribed by regulation 54 of these Regulations shall entitle a prisoner to be eligible for remission of sentence from the date of passing of the sentence which brings the total sentences passed up to the required period; that is to say, in such a case, the prisoner is eligible for remission in respect of the sentence last passed and of any unexpired portion of his previous sentence or sentences but not in respect of that portion of his previous sentence or sentences which he has already served prior to the date of the passing of the sentence which brings the total sentences passed up to the minimum required.

The result of this examination shall be entered by the superintendent in his journal. The guard shall be searched daily when coming on duty.

[No. 35 of 1926.]

67.	The condemned convict should be exercised under a double guard for one hour daily.

69.	All executions are to take place at the place appointed by the Minister, or by the person nominated by the Minister. The sheriff, or deputy sheriff, the superintendent, the medical officer and the chief warder of the prison shall be present at every execution.

Signature of Declarant

DATED at	this	day of	20	

Director of Prisons, Superintendent or Magistrate

92.	(1) For the purpose of this Regulation the word 'warder' shall mean all Prison warders (or ward-resses) who are not depositors in the Fund established by the Nigerian Social Insurance Trust Fund Act, and are not pensionable under the Pensions Act.

[No. 49 of 1955, Cap. N90 and Cap. P4. ]

(2) Subject to the provisions of this Regulation a warder may be granted the following retiring benefits—

[No. 49 of 1955.]

(a) on completion of fifteen or more years continuous service an annual allowance calculated on the basis of 1/960th of his annual emoluments at the date of retirement for each completed

month of service prior to 1 January, 1946, and 1/800th of his annual emoluments at the date of retirement for each completed month of service after 31 December, 1945, or in lieu of such allowance a reduced allowance at the rate of three-fourths of such allowance and a gratuity equal to ten times the amount by which such allowance is reduced; or

(b) on completion of five years but less than fifteen years continuous service a gratuity calculated at l/20th of a month’s pay for each completed month of service prior to 1 January, 1946, and at 6/100ths of a month’s pay for each completed month of service after 31 December, 1945:

Provided that there shall not be taken into account for the purpose of computing an annual allow-ance or gratuity any service before a warder attains the age of eighteen years.

(3)	Where a warder has rendered at least twenty-five years’ good service and has attained the age of forty-five years but his service has not been continuous, the Minister may, in his discretion, treat such service as if it had been continuous for the purpose of the calculation of the annual allowance and gratu-ity for which the warder might otherwise have been eligible under paragraph (2) of this regulation on final discharge:

Provided that there shall be deducted from any annual allowance or gratuity so granted any sums previously paid to such warder by way of gratuities, and further provided that this paragraph shall only apply if any annual allowance previously granted under paragraph (2) of this regulation has been sus-pended during any such further period of service.

(4)	Where the service of a warder has not been such good service as to justify the payment of the full annual allowance or gratuity on discharge for which he would otherwise have been eligible, the Minister may, on the recommendation of the Director of Prisons, approve the award of such reduced annual allowance or gratuity as he may deem just.

(5)	Where a warder who has completed more than five years continuous service dies whilst still in the prison service, the gratuity which might have been payable in accordance with paragraph (2) of this regulation may be granted to his dependants, provided that such gratuity shall in no case exceed one year’s emoluments calculated on the final monthly rate of pay at the date of his death.

(6)	Every warder who joined the prison service prior to the commencement of the Act shall be enti-tled, if he so elect, to such pension or gratuity as he would have earned under the law in force when he enlisted in lieu of the annual allowance or gratuity hereby conferred.

(7)	If any warder to whom an annual allowance has been granted under this regulation is sentenced to a term of imprisonment before any competent court for any criminal offence then in every such case the Minister may direct that such allowance shall forthwith cease:

Provided always that the allowance shall be restored with retrospective effect in the case of a warder who, after conviction as above described, at any time receives a free pardon and provided further that where an allowance ceases by reason of the conviction of the warder to whom it was granted, the Minister may cause all or any part of it to be paid to or applied to the benefit of any wife, child or children of such warder, or, after the expiration of the sentence, to the warder.

(8)	This regulation shall be deemed to have come into operation on 1 November, 1947.

[No. 49 of 1955.]

93.	Leave of absence shall be granted to all warders on the same conditions as those applicable to offi-cials and employees in other Government departments, in accordance with the provisions made from time to time in the Federal Civil Service Regulations.

(a) the Nigeria Prison Service Cross;

(b)	the Long Service and Good Conduct Medal; and

(c)	the Meritorious Service Medal.

(2)	The number of Meritorious Service Medals awarded in any one year shall not exceed six (ex-clusive of medals issued as replacements under article 9 of this warrant) save that if the President is of the opinion that special circumstances justify an exceptional award he may exceed that number.

2.	Eligibility for award of medals

(1)	The Nigeria Prison Service Cross may be awarded to any member of the prison service for a most conspicuous act of gallantry in the course of duty.

(2)	The Long Service and Good Conduct Medal may be awarded to any member of the prison ser-vice who has completed eighteen years continuous service (exclusive of any period of service in the armed forces) with an exemplary record, that is to say, his conduct sheet shows that—

(i)	he has not suffered any punishment during the period of twelve years immediately pre-ceding the date of his recommendation for the award; or

(ii)	he has not suffered any punishment during the period of six years immediately preceding the date of his recommendation for the award and he has not suffered more than six punishments, of which none is a major punishment, during the whole period of his service.

(3)	The Meritorious Service Medal may be awarded to any prison officer for long and devoted ser-vice characterised by exceptional ability and exemplary record.

3.	Award of bar or clasp for additional services

(1)	If a person to whom the Nigeria Prison Service Cross has been awarded under article 2 (1) of this warrant, subsequently performs another act which, if he had not been awarded that medal, would have rendered him eligible for it, he may be awarded a bar to be affixed to the ribbon attached to the medal, and an additional bar may be awarded for every additional performance of such acts.

(2)	Where a holder of a Long Service and Good Conduct Medal completes a total of twenty-five years’ service (including his service before the award of the medal) with such exemplary record as is mentioned in article 2 (2) of this warrant, he may be awarded a clasp to be affixed to the ribbon at-tached to the medal, and he may be awarded another clasp at the completion of a further period of five years service thereafter with exemplary record.

4.	Recommendation for award of medals and clasps

The President shall not award a service medal, or a bar or clasp thereto to any person, unless the Di-rector of Prisons submits a recommendation for the award in respect of that person to the Immigration and Prisons Services Board and the Immigration and Prisons Services Board recommends that person to the President for the award.

[No. Hof 1986.]

5.	Mode of awarding medals, etc.

8.	Deprivation and restoration
