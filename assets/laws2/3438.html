     (7)  Where any property has been taken from a suspect under this section, and the suspect is not charged before a court but is released     on the ground that there is no sufficient reason to believe that he has committed an offence,    any property so taken from the suspect shall be returned to him, provided          the property is neither connected to nor a proceed of an offence.

     (3)  An authority under subsection (2) may only be given when the premises to be searched are, or within the preceding twelve months have been, in the   occupation of any person who has been convicted of receiving stolen       property or of harbouring thieves, or of any offence involving fraud or dishonesty, and punishable by imprisonment.

            (e)       a person is carrying a certain type of article at an unusual time or in a place where a number of burglaries or thefts are known to have taken place recently.

    (3)   If, in the course of a search, a police officer discovers an article which he has reasonable grounds for suspecting to be a stolen or prohibited article, he may seize it.

Action before a search takes place.

50.      (1) Where a police officer is exercising the powers under section 51 of this    Act he shall, before carrying out the search, question the person about his    behaviour or his presence in circumstances which gave rise to the suspicion.

            (2)       If the person to be searched has a satisfactory explanation which makes a search unnecessary or other circumstances come to the attention of the police officer that make the search unnecessary, no search may take place.

            (3)       Before any search of a detained person or vehicle may take place, the officer shall give the person to be searched or in charge of the vehicle:

                        (a)       his name and the name of the police station to which he is attached;

    (2)   The co-operation of the person to be searched shall be sought in every case.

     (3)  A forcible search may be used as a last resort only if it has been established that the person being searched is unwilling to co-operate      or resists.

      (4) The length of time for which a person or vehicle may be detained for a search depends on the circumstances, but this shall be within a reasonable time.

     (5)  Searches in public shall be restricted to superficial examination of outer clothing.

     (6)  Where it is considered necessary to conduct a more thorough search that requires a person to take off his cloth or headgear, it:

            (b)       may not be made in the presence of anyone of the opposite sex unless the person being searched requests it. 

Search of arrested suspect.

52.

            (a)       which he might use to assist him to escape from lawful custody; or

            (b)       instrument of violence or poisonous substance;

            (c)       tools connected with the kind of offence which he is alleged to have committed; or

            (d)       other articles which may furnish evidence against him in regard to the offence, which he is alleged to have committed.

     (4)  The power to search conferred under subsection (2) is only a power to search to the extent that is reasonably required for the purpose of discovering anything or evidence.

    (5)   The powers conferred under this section to search a person are not    to be construed as authorising a police officer to require a person to   remove any of his clothing in public.

 (6)      A Police Officer may not search premises in the exercise of the power conferred under subsection(2)          (b) unless he has reasonable grounds for believing that there is evidence for which a search is permitted under that paragraph on the premises.

                        (i)        could be used to cause physical injury to himself or others, and

                        (a)       believes that the person from whom it is seized may use it to:

                                    (i)        cause physical injury to himself or any other person,

            (b)       incapable of understanding what is said to him.
