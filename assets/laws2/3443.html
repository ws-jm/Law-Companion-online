          (a)     take or subscribe for more shares than he held at the date on which                             he became a member; or

          (b)     increase his liability to contribute to the share capital of the                                company; or

          (a)     a special resolution that it should be so re-registered is passed;

          (b)     the conditions specified under subsection (2) are met, and

          (c)      an application for re-registration is delivered to the Commission in                             accordance with section 60, together with—

                   (ii)     a statement of compliance.

   (2)  The conditions are—

          (a)     that the company has a share capital;

          (b)     that the requirements of section 57 are met as regards its share                                     capital;

          (c)      that the requirements of section 5 8 are met as regards its net assets;

          (d)     if section 59 applies, that the requirements of that section are met;                     and

          (e)      that the company has not previously been re-registered as an                                      unlimited company.

    (3) The company shall make such changes to its name and articles, as are      necessary in connection with its becoming a public company.

   (4)  If the company is unlimited it shall also make such changes in its articles as      are necessary in connection with its becoming a company limited by shares.

 

57.     Requirements as to share capital.

   (1)  The following requirements shall be met at the time the special resolution          is passed that the company should be re-registered as a public company—

          (a)     the nominal value of the company's allotted share capital shall be not                          less than the minimum specified in section 27 (2);

          (b)     the company's allotted shares shall be paid up at least one-quarter of                           the nominal value of that share and the whole of any premium on it;

          (c)      if any share in the company or any premium on it has been fully or                             partly paid up by an undertaking given by any person that he or                                  another should work or perform services (whether for the company                            or any other person), the undertaking shall have been performed or                            otherwise discharged; or

          (d)     if shares have been allotted as fully or partly paid up as to their                                   nominal value or any premium on them otherwise than in cash, and                            the consideration for the allotment consists of, or includes, an                                     undertaking to the company (other than one to which paragraph (c)                            applies), then either—

          (i)      the undertaking shall have been performed or otherwise discharged,                            or

          (ii)     there shall be a contract between the company and some person                        pursuant to which the undertaking is to be performed within five                       years from the time the special resolution is passed.

    (2) Shares allotted in pursuance of an employees' share scheme, by reason of           which the company would, but for this subsection, be precluded under    subsection (1) (b) from being re-registered as a public company, shall not        be regarded for the purpose of determining whether the requirements in     subsection (1) (b), (c) and (d) are met.

  (3)   No more than one-tenth of the nominal value of the company's allotted    share capital is to be disregarded under subsection (2) and for this purpose       the allotted share capital is treated as not including shares disregarded    under          the subsection.

   (4)  Shares disregarded under subsection (2) are treated as not forming part of         the allotted share capital for the purposes of subsection (1) (a).

  (5)   A company shall not be re-registered as a public company if it appears to         the Commission that—

          (a)     the company has resolved to reduce its share capital;

          (b)     the reduction is supported by a solvency statement in accordance                       with regulations made by the Minister; and

          (c)      the effect of the reduction is, or will be, that the nominal value of the                            company's allotted share capital is below the minimum specified in                             section 27 (2).

 

58.     Requirements as to net assets.

    (1) A company applying to re-register as a public company shall obtain—

          (a)     a balance sheet prepared as at a date not more than seven month                       before the date on which the application is delivered to the                                 Commission;

          (b)     an unqualified report by the company’s auditor on that balance                                   sheet; and

          (c)      a written statement by the company's auditor that, in his opinion at                            the balance sheet date, the amount of file company's net assets was                             not less than the aggregate of its called-up share capital and un-                                   distributable reserves.

   (2)  Between the date of the balance sheet and the date on which the      application for re- registration is delivered to the Commission, there shall     be no change in the company's financial position that results in the amount         of its net assets becoming less than the aggregate of its called-up share        capital and un-distributable reserves.

   (3)  In subsection (1) (b), an “unqualified report” means—

          (a)     if the balance sheet was prepared for a financial year of the                               company, a report stating without material qualification the auditor's                          opinion that the balance sheet has been properly prepared in                                       accordance with the requirements of this Act;

          (b)     if the balance sheet was not prepared for a financial year of the                                    company, a report stating without material qualification the auditor's                          opinion that the balance sheet has been properly prepared in                                       accordance with the provisions of this Act which would have applied                         if it had been prepared for a financial year of the company.

    (4) For the purpose of an auditor's report on a balance sheet that was not     prepared for a financial year of the company, the provisions of this Act        apply with such modifications as are necessary.

    (5) For the purposes of subsection (3), a qualification is material unless the   auditor states in his report that the matter giving rise to the qualification is          not material for the purpose of determining (by reference to the company's    balance sheet) whether at the date of the balance sheet the amount of the          company's net assets was not less than the aggregate of its called-up share   capital and un-distributable reserves.

    (6) In this Part -

          (a)     “net assets” means the aggregate of the company's assets less the                       aggregate of its liabilities, and

          (b)     "un-distributable reserves" are its —

                   (i)      share premium account, and

                   (ii)     capital redemption reserve;

          (c)      the amount by which its accumulated or unrealised profits (so far as                          not previously utilised by capitalisation) exceed its accumulated or                             unrealised losses (so far as not previously written off in a reduction                            or reorganisation of capital duly made); and

          (d)     any other reserve that the company is prohibited from distributing                             by any enactment (other than one contained in this Part) or by its                      articles. The reference in subsection (6) (c) to capitalisation does not                            Include a transfer of profits of the company to its capital redemption                          reserve.

 

59.     Recent allotment of shares for non-cash consideration.

   (1)  This section applies where the shares are allotted —

          (a)     by the company in the period between the date the balance sheet                        required by section 58 is prepared and the passing of the resolution                             that the company should re-register as a public company; and

          (b)     as fully or partly paid up as to their nominal value or any premium on                        them otherwise than in cash.

  (2)   The Commission shall not entertain an application by the company for re-          registration as a public company unless the requirements of section 57    have been complied with, or the allotment is in connection with—

          (a)     a share exchange as described in subsections (3) - (5); or

          (b)     a proposed merger with another company as described in subsection                           (6).

   (3)  An allotment is in connection with a share exchange if—

          (a)     the shares are allotted in connection with an arrangement under

                   which the whole or part of the consideration for the shares allotted is                           provided by—

                   (i)      the transfer to the company allotting the shares of shares (or                                       shares of a particular class) in another company, or

                   (ii)     the cancellation of shares (or shares of a particular class) in                               another company; and

          (b)     the allotment is open to all the holders of the shares of the other                         company in question (or, where the arrangement applies only to                        shares of a particular class, to all the holders of the company's shares                          that class) to take part in the arrangement in connection with                                      which the shares are allotted.

   (4)  In determining whether a person is a holder of shares for the purposes of           subsection (3), there shall be disregarded—

          (a)     shares held by, or by a nominee of, the company allotting the shares;                           and

          (b)     shares held by, or by a nominee of—

                   (i)      the holding company of the company allotting the shares,

                   (ii)     a subsidiary of the company allotting the shares, or

                   (iii)    a subsidiary of the holding company of the company allotting                                     the shares.

    (5) It is immaterial, for the purposes of deciding whether an allotment is in           connection with a share exchange, whether or not the arrangement in           connection with which the shares are allotted involves the issue to the      company allotting the shares of shares (or shares of a particular class) in       the other company.

   (6)  There is a proposed merger with another company if one of the companies           concerned proposes to acquire all the assets and liabilities of the other in           exchange for the issue of its shares or other securities to shareholders of the other.

    (7) For the purposes of this section—

          (a)     the consideration for an allotment does not include any amount                                    standing to the credit of any of the company's reserve accounts, or of                          its profit and loss account, that has been applied in paying up (to any                        extent) any of the shares allotted or any premium on those shares;                     and

          (b)     “arrangement” means any agreement, scheme or arrangement                                       pursuant to Chapter 27.

          (a)     extinguish or reduce the liability on any of its shares in respect of                      share capital not paid up,

          (b)     either with or without extinguishing or reducing liability on any of its                         shares, cancel any paid-up share capital which is lost or                                              unrepresented by available assets, or

   (3)  A special resolution under this section shall in this Act be referred to as “a           resolution for reducing share capital”.

   (3)  Every creditor of the company who, at the date fixed by the court, is       entitled to any debt or claim which, if that date were the commencement         of the winding up of the company, would be admissible in proof against the          company, is entitled to object to the reduction of capital.

   (4)  The Court shall settle a list of creditors entitled to object, and for that      purpose—

          (a)     shall ascertain, as far as possible without requiring an application                      from any creditor, the names of those creditors and the nature and                     amount of the debts or claims; and

          (b)     may publish notices fixing a day or days within which creditors not                            entered on the list are to claim to be so entered or are to be                                 excluded from the right of objecting to the reduction of capital.

   (5)  If a creditor entered on the list whose debt or claim is not discharged or has      not been determined does not consent to the reduction, the Court may, if it    deems fit, dispense with the consent of that creditor, on the company    securing payment of his debt or claim by appropriating (as the Court may       direct) die following amount if the company —

          (a)     admits the foil amount of the debt or claim or, though not admitting                           it, is willing to provide for the foil amount of the debt or claim; or

          (b)     does not admit, and is not willing to provide for, the foil amount of                           the debt or claim, or if the amount is contingent or not ascertained,                             then an amount fixed by the court after the like enquiry and                               adjudication as if the company were being wound up by the Court.

   (6)  If a proposed reduction of share capital involves either the diminution of          any liability in respect of unpaid share capital or the payment to any    shareholder of any paid-up share capital, the Court may, if having regard to       any special circumstance of the case it considers proper to do so, direct         that subsections (3)- (5) shall not apply as regards any class or classes of      creditors.

                   Provided that the allotment shall be so voidable notwithstanding that                          the company is in the course of being wound up.

   (2)  If any director of a company knowingly contravenes, permits or authorises       the contravention of any of the provisions of this Act with respect to   allotment, he is liable to compensate the company and the allottee        respectively for any loss, damages or costs which the company or they may       have sustained or incurred thereby, but proceedings to recover any such       loss, damages, or costs shall not be commenced after the expiration of two     years from the date of the allotment

          (b)     in the case of shares allotted as fully or partly paid up otherwise than                          in cash—

                   Commission, but where the Commission requires that additional                        documents or particulars be submitted it shall grant the company                      additional time of at least seven days within which to provide the                      additional documents and particulars, and the additional time                                      granted is deemed to be an extension of the one month period in                        subsection (1).

155.   Prohibition of payments of commissions, discounts out of shares and   capital

   (1)  Except as provided in section 156, no company shall apply any of its shares    or capital money either directly or indirectly in payment of any commission,         discount or allowance to any person in consideration of his subscribing or   agreeing to subscribe, whether absolutely or conditionally, for any share in    the company, or procuring or agreeing to procure subscriptions, whether          absolute or conditional, for any share in the company, whether the shares      or capital money are so applied by being added to the purchase money of        any property acquired by the company or to the contract price of any work    to be executed for the company, or any such money is paid out of the           nominal purchase money or contract price, or otherwise.

   (2)  Nothing in this section affects the payment of any brokerage or agency fees           agreed between the company and a broker or agent of the company, for   services provided by such broker or agent in connection with the raising of the capital by the company.

CALL ON AND PAYMENT FOR SHARES

158.   Call on shares

   (1)  Subject to the terms of the issue of the shares and of the articles, the        directors may make calls upon the members in respect of any money   unpaid on their shares (whether on account of the nominal value of the shares or by way of premium) and not by the conditions of allotment of the     shares made payable at fixed times:

          Provided that no call shall exceed one fourth of the nominal value of the share or be payable at less than one month from the date fixed for the          payment of the last preceding call, and each member shall (subject to          receiving at least 14 days’ notice specifying the time or times and place of    payment) pay to the company at the time or times and place so specified    the amount called on his shares, so however that a call may be revoked or       postponed as the directors may determine.

   (2)  A call is deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the           directors authorising the call was passed, and may be required to be paid          by instalments.

   (3)  The joint holders of a share are jointly liable to pay all calls in respect of the           share.

   (4)  If a sum called in respect of a share is not paid before or on the day         appointed for payment, the person from whom the sum is due shall pay         interest on the sum from the day appointed for payment to the time of       actual          payment at such rate not exceeding the current bank rate per      annum, as   the directors may determine, but the directors are at liberty to   waive          payment of such interest wholly or in part.

   (5)  A sum which by the terms of issue of a share becomes payable on allotment or at any fixed date, whether on account of the nominal value of    the shares or by way of premium shall, for the purposes of these provisions,    is deemed to be a call duly made and payable on the date on which by the   terms of issue the same becomes payable, and in case of non- payment, all              the relevant provisions of this Act as to payment of interest and expenses,    forfeiture or otherwise apply as if such sum had become payable by virtue     of a call duly made and notified.

   (6)  The directors may, if they think fit, receive from any member willing to   advance the same, all or any part of the money uncalled and unpaid upon    any share held by him, and upon all or any of the money so advanced may      (until the same would, but for such advance, become payable) pay interest      at such rate not exceeding the current bank rate per annum as may be     agreed upon between the directors and the member paying such sum in         advance (unless the company in general meeting otherwise directs).

 

159.   Reserve liability of company having share capital

          A company limited by shares may, by special resolution determine that any           portion of its share capital which has not been already called up are not capable of being called up except in the event and for the purposes of the        company being wound up and thereupon, that portion of its share capital       shall not be capable of being called up, except in the event and for the    purposes specified in subsection (1).

 

 

160.   Payment for shares.

          Subject to the provisions of sections 161 and 162, the shares of a company      and any premium on them shall be paid up in cash, or where the articles so    permit, by a valuable consideration other than cash or partly in cash and partly by a valuable consideration other than cash.

 

161.   Meaning of payment in cash

   (1)  Shares are not deemed to have been paid for in cash except to the extent that the company shall have actually received cash for them at the time of, or subsequently to, the agreement to issue the shares.

   (2)  Where shares are issued to a person who has sold or agreed to sell property or rendered or agreed to render services to the company or to    persons nominated by him, the amount of any payment made for the   property or services shall be deducted from the amount of any cash       payment  made for the shares and only the balance (if any) shall be treated    as having been paid in cash for such shares notwithstanding any exchange           of cheques or other securities for money.

 

162.   Payment for shares of public companies other than in cash

   (1)  Where a public company agrees to accept payment for its shares otherwise       than wholly in cash, it shall appoint an independent valuer who shall     determine the true value of the consideration other than cash and prepare          and submit to the company a report on the value of the consideration.

   (2)  The valuer is entitled to require from the officers of the company such           information and explanation as he thinks necessary to enable him to carry        out the valuation or make the report under subsection (1).

   (3)  The company shall, not more than three days after it receives the valuer's           report, send a copy of the report to the proposed purchaser of shares, and           indicate to the proposed purchaser whether or not it intends to accept the           consideration as payment or part payment for its shares.

   (4)  A public company shall not accept as payment or part payment for its    shares           consideration other than cash unless the cash value of the      consideration as determined by the valuer is worth at least as much as may     be credited as paid up in respect of the shares allowed to the proposed     purchaser.

   (5)  A valuer who, in his report or otherwise, knowingly or recklessly makes a           statement which is misleading, false or deceptive in a material particular,           commits an offence and is liable to imprisonment for a term of 12 months         or a fine as shall be imposed by the court, or both.

    (6) For the purposes of this section, “valuer” means an auditor, a valuer,      surveyor, an engineer or accountant not being a person in the employment     of the company nor an agent or associate of the company or any of its   directors or officers.

 

163.   Power to pay different amounts on shares

          Where it is authorised by its articles, a company may—

          (a)     make arrangements on the issue of shares for a difference between                     the shareholders in the amounts and times of payment of calls on                      their shares;

          (b)     accept from any member the whole or a part of the amount                                remaining unpaid on any shares held by him, although no part of that                         amount has been called up; or

          (c)      pay dividends in proportion to the amount paid up on each share                      where a larger amount is paid up on some shares than on others.

 

164.   ( 1) A company has a first and paramount lien on every share, (not being a

          fully paid Lien on shares, share) for all money (whether currently payable or    not) called or payable at a fixed time in respect of that share, and the     company also has a first and paramount lien on all shares (other than fully          paid shares) standing registered in the name of a single person for all   money presently payable by him or his estate to the company, but the          directors may at any time declare any share to be wholly or in part exempt         from the provisions of this subsection.

   (2)  A company's lien, if any, on a share shall extend to all dividends payable on,    and any bonus shares issued in relation to such share.

  (3)   A company may sell, in such manner as the directors think fit, any share on           which the company has a lien, but no sale shall be made unless a sum in respect of which the lien exists is currently payable, nor until the expiration   of 14 days after a notice in writing, demanding payment of such part of the      amount in respect of which the lien exists as is currently payable, has been   given to the registered holder of the shares, or the person entitled to them         by reason of his death or bankruptcy.

  (4)   For the purpose of giving effect to any such sale, the directors may          authorise a person to transfer the shares sold to the purchaser of the    shares         and the purchaser shall be registered as the holder of the shares         comprised   in any such transfer.

  (2)   The purchaser is not bound to see to the application of the purchase money      and his title to the shares is not affected by any irregularity or invalidity in     the proceedings in reference to the sale.

    (3) The proceeds of the sale of any share pursuant to this section shall be      received by the company and applied in payment of such part of the amount in respect of which the lien exists as is presently payable, and the     residue, if any, shall (subject to a like lien for sums not presently payable as    existed upon the shares before the sale) be paid to the person entitled to the shares at the date of the sale.

 

165.   Forfeiture of shares

   (1) If a member fails to pay any call or instalment of a call on the day appointed    for payment, the directors may, thereafter during such time as any part of     the call or instalment remains unpaid, serve a notice on him requiring    payment of the sum of the cal 1 or instalment as is unpaid, together with          any interest which may have accrued.

   (2)  The notice shall state a further day (not earlier than the expiration of 14 days from the date of service of the notice) on or before which the          payment required by the notice is to be made, and it shall state that in the          event of non-payment at or before the time appointed, the shares in      respect of which the call was made are liable to be forfeited.

   (3)  If the requirements of the notice as is mentioned in subsections (1) and (2)         are not complied with, any share in respect of which notice was given may,   at any time thereafter, before the payment required by the notice is made,         be forfeited by a resolution of the directors to that effect.

 (4)    A forfeited share may be sold or otherwise disposed of on such terms and         in such manner as the directors think fit, and at any time before a sale or     disposition, the forfeiture may be cancelled on such terms as the directors      think fit.

   (5)  A person whose shares have been forfeited ceases to be a member in        respect of the forfeited shares, but shall, notwithstanding, remain liable to      pay to the company all money which, at the date of forfeiture, were        payable by him to the company in respect of the shares, but his liability ceases when the company receives payment in full of all money in respect of the shares.

   (6)  A statutory declaration that the declarant is a director or the secretary of           the company, and that a share in the company has been duly forfeited on a   date stated in the declarations, is primafacie evidence of the facts stated in        it as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the shares.

   (7)  The company may receive the consideration, if any, given for the share on        any sale or disposition of it and may execute a transfer of the share in   favour of the person to whom the share is sold or disposed of, and he shall      there upon be registered as the holder of the share, and is not bound to see         to the application of the purchase money, if any, nor shall his title to the          share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in          reference to the forfeiture, sale or disposal of the share.

   (8)  The provisions of this section as to forfeiture apply in the case of non-    payment of any sum which, by the terms of issue of a share, becomes payable at a fixed time, whether on account of the nominal value of the   share or by way of premium, as if the same had been payable by virtue of a         call duly made and notified.

 

CLASSES OF SHARES

166    Power to vary rights

   (1) If at any time the share capital of a company is divided into different classes     of shares under section 143, the rights attached to any class (unless    otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the shares of that class) may,        whether or not the company is being wound up, be varied- (a)         in       accordance with the provision in the company’s articles for the variation of       those rights; or

          (b)     where the company's articles contain no such provision, with the                       consent, in writing, of the holders of three- quarters of the issued                       shares of that class, or with the sanction of a special resolution                                    passed at a separate general meeting of the holders of the shares of                              the class.

   (2)  To every such separate general meeting as mentioned in subsection (1), the           provisions of this Act relating to general meetings apply, but the necessary           quorum shall be two persons at least holding or representing by proxy one-           third of the issued shares of the class and that any holder of shares of the           class present in person or by proxy may demand a poll.

   (3)  The rights conferred upon the holders of the shares of any class issued with           preferred or other rights are not, unless otherwise expressly provided by           the terms of issue of the shares of that class, be deemed to be varied by the    creation or issue of further shares ranking paripassu with them.

   (4)  Any proposed amendment of a provision contained in a company's articles      for the variation of the rights attached to a class of shares, or the insertion    of any such provision into the articles, shall be treated as a variation of   those rights and shall require the consent, in writing, of the holders of    three- quarters of the issued shares of that class, or the sanction of a special      resolution passed at a separate general meeting of the holders of the       shares         of the class, before the procedure for the amendment of the articles        can    proceed.

 

167. Application for cancellation of variation.

   (1)  Where in pursuance of section 166, the rights attached to any class of      shares are at any time varied, the holder of at least 15% of the issued    shares of that class, being persons who did not consent to or vote in favour         of the resolution for the variation, may apply to the Court to have the variation cancelled, and, where any such application is made, the variation    shall not have effect, unless it is confirmed by the court, and for the     purpose of this section, any share in the company's share capital that are          held by the company as treasury shares shall not be taken into account for      the purpose of computing the aggregate per cent of shares held by holders    seeking to make an application to the Court.

   (2)  An application to the court under this section shall, in a proper case, be made within 21 days after the date on which the consent was given or the         resolution was passed, as the case may be, and may be made on behalf of     the shareholders entitled to make the application or by such one or more      of them as they may appoint in writing for the purpose.

   (3)  If on any such application the court, after hearing the applicant and any other persons applying to it to be heard and appearing to be interested in         the application, is satisfied that the variation would unfairly prejudice the      shareholders of the class represented by the applicant, the Court, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, may disallow the variation, and         shall, if not satisfied, confirm the variation.

   (4)  The decision of the Court on any such application is final.

   (5)  The company shall, within 15 days after the making of an order by the    Court on an application to it under this section, forward a copy of the order to the Commission and if default is made in complying with the provisions      of this subsection, the company and each officer of the company is liable to         such fine as the Commission shall specify in the regulation for every day          during which the default continues.

    (6) Indus section, “variation” includes abrogation, and cognate expressions are           construed accordingly.

 

 

168.   Right of a preference share to more than one vote

   (1)  Notwithstanding the provisions of section 140, the articles may provide that preference shares issued after the commencement of this Act shall carry the rights to attend general meetings and on a poll at the meetings, to        more than one vote per share in the following circumstances, but not      otherwise, but upon any resolution—

          (a)     during such period as the preferential dividend or any part of it                                    remains in arrears and unpaid, such period starting from a date not                            more than 12 months or such lesser period as the articles may                                     provide, after the due date of the dividend;

          (b)     which varies the rights attached to such shares;

          (c)      to remove an auditor of the company or to appoint another person                             in place of such auditor; or

          (d)     for the winding up of the company or during the winding up of the                             company.

   (2)  Notwithstanding the provisions of section 140, any special resolution of a           company increasing the number of shares of any class, may validly resolve       that any existing class of preference shares shall carry the right to such votes additional to one vote per share as is necessary in order to preserve        die existing ratio which the votes exercisable by the holders of such     preference shares at a general meeting of die company bear to the total    votes exercisable at the meeting.

    (3) For the purposes of subsection (2), a dividend is deemed to be due on the         date appointed in the articles for die payment of the dividend for any year      or other period, or if no such date is appointed, upon the day immediately     following the expiration of the year or other period, and whether or not       such dividend shall have been earned or declared.

 

169. Construction of class rights.

          In construing the provisions of a company's articles in respect of the rights           attached to shares, the following rules of construction shall be observed—

          (a)     unless the contrary intention appears, no dividend is payable on any                          shares unless the company resolves to declare such dividend;

          (b)     unless the contrary intention appears, a fixed preferential dividend                             payable on any class of shares is cumulative, and no dividend shall be                         payable on any share ranking subsequent to them until all the arrears                          of the fixed dividend have been paid;

          (c)      unless the contrary intention appears, in a winding up arrears of any                          cumulative preferential dividend, whether earned or declared or not,                            are payable up to the date of actual payment in the winding up;

          (d)     if any class of shares is expressed to have a right to a preferential                      dividend, then, unless the contrary intention appears, such class has                            no further right to participate in dividends;

          (e)      if any class of shares is expressed to have preferential rights to                                   payment out of the assets of the company in the event of winding                      up, then, unless the contrary intention appears, such class has no                      further right to participate in the distribution of assets in the winding                          up;

          (f)      in determining the rights of the various classes to share in the                                      distribution of the company's property on a winding up. no regard                             shall be given, unless the contrary intention appears, to whether or                             not such property represents accumulated profits or surplus which                             would have been available for dividend while the company remained                          a going concern; and

          (g)     subject to this section, all shares rank equally in all respects unless                             the contrary intention appears in the company's articles.

 

NUMBERING OF SHARES

170.   Shares to be numbered

Each share in a company having a share capital shall be distinguished by its appropriate number:

Provided that, if at any time all the issued shares in a company, or all of its issued shares of a particular class, are fully paid up and rank paripassu for all purposes, none of those shares need thereafter have a distinguishing number so long as it remains fully paid up and ranks paripassu for all purposes with all shares of the same class for the time being issued and fully paid up.

 

SHARE CERTIFICATES

171.   Issue of share certificates

   (1)  Every company shall, within two months after the allotment of any of its           shares and within three months after the date on which a transfer of any such shares is lodged with the company, complete and have ready for    delivery the certificates of all shares allotted or transferred, unless the     conditions of issue of the shares otherwise provide.

   (2)  Every person whose name is entered as a member in the register of          members is entitled, without payment, to receive within three months of        allotment or lodgment of transferor within such other period as the       conditions of issue provide, one certificate for all his shares or several         certificates each for one or more of his shares upon payment of a fee as the directors shall determine.

   (3)  Every certificate issued by a company shall be under the company's seal (where the company has a common seal) or otherwise signed as a deed by       the company and shall specify the shares to which it relates and the       amount paid up on them:

          Provided that in respect of shares held jointly by several persons, the      company is not bound to issue more than one certificate, and delivery of a     certificate for shares to one of several joint holders shall be sufficient      delivery to all such holders.

   (4)  If a share certificate is defaced, lost or destroyed, it may be replaced on    such term, as to evidence and indemnity and the payment of out-of-pocket      expenses of the company of investigating evidence as the directors think        fit.

   (5)  If any company on which a notice has been served requiring it to make    good any default in complying with the provisions of subsection (1), fails to make good the default within 10 days after the service of the notice, the          Court may, on the application of the person entitled to have the certificate   delivered to him, make an order directing the company and any officer of     the company to make good the default within such time as may be        specified in the order, and the order may provide that all costs of and           incidental to the application shall be borne by the company or by any      officer of the company responsible for the default.

   (6)  If default is made in complying with this section, the company and each officer of the company is liable to such penalty as the Commission shall        specify in the regulation for every day during which the default continues.

 

172.   Effect of share certificate

   (1)  A certificate, under the common seal of the company (where the company         has a common seal) or otherwise signed as a deed by the company,       specifying any share held by any member, is a prima facie evidence of the    title of the member to the shares.

   (2)  If any person changes his position to his detriment in good faith on the    continued accuracy of the statements made in a certificate, the company         shall be stopped from denying the continued accuracy of such statements       and shall compensate the person for any loss suffered by him in reliance on           them and which he would not have suffered had the statements been or continued to be accurate.

   (3)  Nothing in subsection (2) shall derogate from any right the company may           have to be indemnified by any other person.

 

 

173.   Probate, etc., as evidence of grant

          The production to a company of any document which is by law sufficient           evidence of probate of the will, or letters of administration of the estate, or           confirmation as executor, of a deceased person having been granted to     some person, shall be accepted by the company as sufficient evidence of the grant, notwithstanding anything in its articles to the contrary.

 

174.   Prohibition of bearer shares.

          (1)     No company has the power to issue bearer shares.

          (2)     For the purposes of this Act, a “bearer share” means a share which is                         represented by a certificate, warrant or other document (in any form                           or by whatever name called) which states or indicates that the bearer                 of the certificate is the owner of the shares.

 

TRANSFER AND TRANSMISSION

175.   Transfer of shares.

   (1)  The transfer of a company's shares shall be by instrument of transfer and           except as expressly provided in the articles, transfer of shares shall be     without restrictions, and instruments of transfer shall include electronic       instrument of transfer.

   (2)  Notwithstanding anything in the articles of a company, a company shall not           register a transfer of shares in the company, unless a proper instrument of           transfer has been delivered to the company:

          Provided that nothing in this section shall prejudice any power of the      company to register as shareholder, any person to whom the right to any      share in the company has been transmitted by operation of law.

   (3)  The instrument of transfer of any share shall be executed by or on behalf of      the transferor and transferee, and the transferor is deemed to remain a holder         of the share until the name of the transferee is entered in the register of   members in respect of the share.

   (4)  Subject to any restrictions of a company's articles as may be applicable, any           member may transfer all or any of his shares by instrument in writing in any           usual or common form or any other form which the directors may approve.

 

176.   Entry in register of transfers.

   (1)  On the application of the transferor of any share or interest in a company,        the company shall enter, in its register of members, the name of the      transferee in the same conditions as if the application for the entry were         made by the transferee, and register of transfer includes electronic

          register of transfer.

   (2)  Until the name of the transferee is entered in the register of members in    respect of the transferred shares, the transferor is, so far as it concerns the     company, deemed to remain the holder of the shares.

   (3)  The company may refuse to register the transfer of a share (not being a    fully paid share) to a person of whom they do not approve, and may also      refuse to register the transfer of a share on which the company has a lien.

   (4)  The company may refuse to recognise any instrument of transfer unless—

          (a)     a fee, as the company may determine, is paid to the company in                                   respect of the instrument;

          (b)     the instrument of transfer is accompanied by the certificate of the                       shares to which it relates and such other evidence as the directors                      may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make

          (c)      the transfer; and the instrument of transfer is in respect of only one                            class of shares.

 

177.   Notice of refusal to register.

   (1)  If a company refuses to register a transfer of any share, it shall, within two           months after the date on which the transfer was lodged with it, send notice        of the refusal to the transferee.

   (2)  If default is made in complying with this section, the company and each officer of the company is liable to such penalty as the Commission shall        specify in the regulation.

 

178.   Transfer by personal representative

          A transfer of the share or other interest of a deceased member of a company made by his personal representative is, although the personal         representative is not himself a member of the company, as valid as if he         had been such a member at the time of the execution of the instrument of          transfer.

 

179.   Transmission of shares

   (1)  In case of the death of a member, the survivor or survivors where the      deceased was a joint holder, or the legal personal representative of the          deceased where he was a sole holder, is die only person recognised by the        company as having any title to his interest in the shares, but nothing in this    section shall release the estate of a deceased joint holder from any liability in respect of any share which had been jointly held by him with other   persons.

   (2)  Any person becoming entitled to a share in consequence of the death or           bankruptcy of a member may, upon such evidence being produced as may        be required by the directors and subject to this section, elect either to be       registered himself as holder of the share, or to have a person nominated by    him registered as the transferee of the share, but the company shall, in          either          case, have the same right to decline or suspend registration as they    would         have had in the case of a transfer of the share by that member          before his    death or bankruptcy, as the case may be.

   (3)  If the person becoming entitled elects to be registered himself, he shall      deliver or send to the company a notice in writing signed by him stating         that he so elects, and if he elects to have another person registered, he    shall testify his election by executing to that person a transfer of the share    in the          prescribed form.

   (4)  All the limitations, restrictions and provisions of this Act and the company's           articles relating to the rights to transfer and the registration of transfers of           share, are applicable to any such notice or transfer as mentioned in          subsection (3) as if the death or bankruptcy of the member had not        occurred and the notice or transfer were a transfer signed by that member.

   (5)  A person becoming entitled to a share by reason of the death or      bankruptcy           of the holder, is entitled to the same dividends and other        advantages to           which he would be entitled if he were the registered holder     of the share,           except that he is not, unless the articles otherwise provide,    before being           registered as a member in respect of the share, entitled in       respect of it to           exercise any right conferred by membership in relation to      meetings of the company:

          Provided that the directors may at any time give notice requiring any such           person to elect either to be registered himself or to transfer the share, and          if the notice is not complied with within 90 days, the directors may   thereafter withhold payment of all dividends, bonuses or other money       payable in respect of the share until the requirements of the notice have   been complied with.

 

180.   Protection of beneficiaries.

   (1)  Any person claiming to be interested in any share, dividend or interest on           them, may protect his interest by serving on the company concerned a     notice           of his interest.

   (2)  The company shall enter, on the register of members, the fact that such    notice has been served and shall not register any transfer or make any   payment or return in respect of the shares contrary to the terms of the   notice          until the expiration of 42 days' notice to the claimant to the    proposed    transfer or payment.

          In the event of any default by the company in complying with this section,        the company shall compensate any person injured by the default.

 

181.   Certification of transfers

   (1)  When the holder of any share of a company wishes to transfer to any      person only a part of the shares represented by one or more certificates,    the instrument of transfer together with the relevant certificates shall be delivered to the company with a request that the instrument of transfer be   recognised and registered and a certificate of transfer shall include a   certificate issued in electronic form.

   (2)  A company to which a request is made under subsection (1), may recognise      the instrument of transfer by endorsing on it the words, “certificate      lodged” or words to the like effect.

    (3) The recognition by a company of any instrument of transfer of shares in the           company shall be taken as a representation by the company to any person           acting on the faith of the recognition that there have been produced to the           company such documents as on the face of them show a prima facie title to       the shares in the transferor named in the instrument of transfer, but not as    a representation that the transferor has any title to the shares.

  (4)   Where any person acts on the faith of a false recognition by a company   made negligently, the company shall be under the same liability to that    person as if the recognition has been made fraudulently.

   (5)  For the purposes of this section—

          (a)     an instrument of transfer is deemed to be recognised if it bears the                      words, “certificate lodged” or words to the like effect;

          (b)     the recognition of an instrument of transfer is deemed to be made by                            a company if—

                   (i)      the person issuing the instrument is a person authorised to                                issue certificated instruments of transfers on the company's                                behalf, and

                   (ii)     the recognition is signed by a person authorised to recognise                                        transfers of shares on the company's behalf or by any officer or                                   servant either of the company or of a body corporate so                                              authorised; and

          (c)      a recognition is deemed to be signed by any person if—

                   (i)      it purports to be authenticated by his signature or initials                                             (whether handwritten or not), and

                   (ii)     it is not shown that the signature or initials was or were placed                                    there by any person other than him or a person authorised to                                      use the signature or initials for the purpose of transfers on the                                     company's behalf.

 

 

 

 

 

TRANSACTIONS BY COMPANY IN RESPECT OF ITS OWN SHARES

182.   Redemption of redeemable preference shares

   (1)  The provisions of this section apply with respect to the redemption by a company of any redeemable preference share issued by it under section         147.

   (2)  The shares are not redeemed unless they are fully paid, and redemption   shall be made only out of—

          (a)     profits of the company which would otherwise be available for                                   dividend; or

          (b)     the proceeds Of a fresh issue of shares made for the purposes of the                           redemption.

   (3)  Before the shares are redeemed, the premium, if any, payable on    redemption, shall be provided for out of the profits of the company or out         of the company's share premium account.

   (4)  Where shares are redeemed otherwise than out of the proceeds of a fresh issue, there shall, out of profits which would otherwise have been available       for dividend, be transferred to a reserve fund, to be called “the capital   redemption reserve account”, a sum equal to the nominal amount of the    shares redeemed, and the provisions of this Act relating to the reduction of      the share capital of a company shall, except as provided in this section,

          apply as if the capital redemption reserve fund were paid-up share capital        of the company.

   (5)  Subject to the provisions of this section, the redemption of preference      shares           may be effected on such terms and in such manner as are provided           by the           articles of the company or in the terms of issue of the relevant        preference           shares.

   (6)  The redemption of preference shares under this section by a company shall       not be taken as reducing the amount of the company's share capital.

   (7)  The capital redemption reserve fund may, notwithstanding anything in this           section, be applied by the company in paying up unissued shares of the   company to be issued to members of the company as fully paid bonus shares.

  (8)   Any redeemable share issued by a company is regarded as a preference    share and the provisions of this Act with respect to preference shares shall    apply to all redeemable shares.

 

183.   Prohibition of Financial Assistance by Company for acquisition of its

          shares

   (1)  In this section-

          (a)     'financial assistance means a gift, guarantee, any form of security or                            indemnity, a loan or any form of credit or any other financial                                      assistance given by a company, the net assets of which are thereby                             reduced by up to 50%, or which has no net assets;

          (f)      an assistance given by a company where its principal purpose

                   in giving the assistance is not to reduce or discharge any liability                        incurred by a person for the purpose of the acquisition of shares in                             the company or its holding company, or the reduction or discharge of                         any such liability, but an incidental part of some larger purpose of the                         company, and the assistance is given in good faith in the interests of                            the company.

   (4)  This section does not prohibit a private company from giving financial    assistance in a case where the acquisition of shares in question is or was an    acquisition of shares in the company or, if it is a subsidiary of another    private company, in that other company, provided that:

          (a)     the financial assistance may only be given if the company has net                       assets which are not thereby reduced or to the extent that they are                      reduced, if the assistance is provided out of distributable profits;

          (b)     the giving of assistance under this section must be approved by                        special resolution of the company in general meeting; and

   (5)  If a company acts in contravention of this section, the company and every           officer of the company who is in default shall be liable to such penalty as          the Commission shall specify by regulation.

TYPES OF DEBENTURES

196.   Perpetual debentures

          A company may issue perpetual debentures, and a condition contained in         any debenture, or in any deed for securing any debentures, shall not be invalid by reason only that the debentures are made irredeemable or      redeemable only on the happening of a contingency, however remote, or      on the expiration of a period, however long, any rule of equity to the     contrary notwithstanding.

 

 

197.   Convertible debentures Secured or unsecured debentures

          Debentures may be issued upon the terms that in lieu of redemption or           repayment, they may, at the option of the holder or the company, be       converted into shares in the company upon such terms as may be stated in     the debentures.

198.   (1) Debentures may either be secured by a charge over the company's

          property or may be unsecured by any charge.

   (2)  Debentures may be secured by a fixed charge on certain of the company's           property or a floating charge over the whole or a specified part of the           company's undertaking and assets, or by both a fixed charge on certain   property and a floating charge.

    (3) A charge securing debentures shall become enforceable on the occurrence          of the events specified in the debentures or the deed securing the same.

   (4)  Where legal proceedings are brought by a debenture holder to enforce the           security of a series of debentures of which he holds part, the debenture    holder shall sue in a representative capacity on behalf of himself and all    other debenture holders of that series.

 

199.   Redeemable debentures

          A company limited by shares may issue debentures which are, or at the   option of the company are, liable to be redeemed.

 

 

200.   Power to re-issue redeemed debentures in certain cases

   (1)  Where either before or after the commencement of this Act, a company    has redeemed any debenture previously issued, unless—

          (a)     any provision, express or implied, to the contrary is contained in the                          articles or in any contract entered into by the company; or

          (b)     the company has, by passing a resolution to that effect or by some                             other act, manifested its intention that the debentures shall be                             cancelled, the company shall have, and shall be deemed always to                      have had, power to re-issue the debentures, either by reissuing the                     same debentures or by issuing other debentures in their place.

   (2)  On a re-issue of redeemed debentures, the person entitled to the      debentures,           shall have, and shall be deemed always to have had, the same         priorities as           if the debentures had never been redeemed.

   (3)  Where a company has, either before or after the commencement of this    Act, deposited any of its debentures to secure advances, from time to time,     on current account or otherwise, the debenture shall not be deemed to    have been redeemed by reason only of the account of the company having        ceased to be in debit, whilst the debentures remained so deposited.

   (4)  The re-issue of a debenture or the issue of another debenture in its place under this section shall be treated as the issue of a new debenture for the         purposes of stamp duty, but it shall not be so treated for the purposes of any provision limiting the amount or number of debentures to be issued.

   (5)  Any person lending money on the security of a debenture re-issued under          this section which appears to be duly stamped, may give the debenture in       evidence in any proceeding for enforcing his security without payment of      the stamp duty or any penalty in respect thereof, unless he had notice of,        or but for his negligence, might have discovered, that the debenture was    not duly stamped, but in any such case the company is liable to pay the   proper stamp duty and penalty.

  (6)   Nothing in this section shall prejudice any power to issue debentures in   place of any debenture paid off or otherwise satisfied or extinguished          which, by its debentures or the securities for the same, is reserved to a       company.

 

201.   Rights of debenture

  (1)   The trustee of a debenture trust deed shall hold all contracts, stipulations         and undertakings given to him and all mortgages, charges and securities         vested in him holders, in connection with the debentures covered by the      deed, or some of those debentures, exclusively for the benefit of the       debenture holders concerned (except in so far as the deed otherwise         provides) and the trustee shall exercise due diligence in respect of the        enforcement of those contracts, stipulations, undertakings, mortgages,           charges and securities and the fulfilment of his functions generally.

   (2)  A debenture holder may sue—

          (a)     the company which issued the debentures he holds for payment of                     any amount payable to him in respect of the debentures; or

          (b)     the trustee of the debenture trust deed covering the debentures he                       holds for compensation for any breach of the duties which the                                     trustee owes him, and in any such action, it shall not be necessary for                          any other debenture holder of the same class, or if the action is                                     brought against the company, the trustee of the covering trust deed,                            to be joined as a party.

   (3)  This section applies notwithstanding anything contained in a debenture or           trust deed or other instrument, but a provision in a debenture or trust deed       is valid and binding on all the debenture holders of the class concerned in    so far as it enables a meeting of the debenture holders by a resolution     supported by the votes of the holders of at least three quarters in value of        the debentures of that class in respect of which votes are cast on the     resolution to-

          (a)     release any trustee from liability for any breach of his duties to the                              debenture holders which he has already committed, or generally                         from liability for all such breaches (without necessarily specifying                      them) upon his ceasing to be trustee;

          (b)     consent to the alteration or abrogation of any of the rights, powers                             or remedies of the debenture holders and the trustee of the                                  debenture trust deed covering their debentures (except the powers                     and remedies under section 233; or

          (c)      consent to the substitution for the debentures of a different class                       issued by the company or any other company or corporation, or the                           cancellation of the debentures in consideration of the issue to the                        debenture holders of shares credited as fully paid in the company or                            any other company.

 

202.   Meetings of debenture holders

   (1)  The terms of any debenture or trust deed may provide for the convening of           general meetings of the debenture holders and for the passing, at such,     meetings, of a resolution binding on all the holders of the debentures of the    same class.

   (2)  Whether or not the debenture or trust deed contain such provisions as are           referred to in subsection (1), the Commission may at any time direct a     meeting of the debenture holders of any class to be held and conducted in        such manner as the Commission deems fit to consider ancillary or    consequential direction as it shall deems fit

   (3)  Notwithstanding anything contained in a debenture trust deed, or in any debenture, contract or instrument, the trustee of a debenture deed shall, on the requisition of persons holding, at the date of the deposit of the    acquisition debentures covered by the trust deed which carry at least one- tenth of the total voting rights attached to all the issued and outstanding          debentures of that class, proceed to convene a meeting of that class of           debenture holders.

 

FIXED AND FLOATING CHARGES

203.   Meaning of floating and fixed charges

  (1)   A “floating charge” means an equitable charge over the whole or a specified part of the company's undertakings and assets, including cash and   uncalled capital of the company both present and future, but so that the         charge shall not preclude the company from dealing with such assets     until—

          (a)     the security becomes enforceable and the holder thereof, pursuant                      to a power in that behalf in the debenture or the deed securing the                      same, appoints a receiver or manager or enters into possession of                      such assets; or

          (b)     the Court appoints a receiver or manager of such assets on the                                     application of the holder; or

          (c)      the company goes into liquidation.

   (2)  On the happening of any of the events mentioned in subsection (1), the    charge shall be deemed to crystallise and become a fixed equitable charge on such of the company's assets as are subject to the charge, and if a receiver or manager is withdrawn with the consent of the charge, or the         charge withdraws from possession before the charge has been fully     discharged, the charge shall thereupon be deemed to cease to be a fixed charge and again to become a floating charge.

 

204.   Priority of fixed over floating charge

          A fixed charge on any property shall have priority over a floating charge           affecting that property, unless the terms on which the floating charge was           granted prohibits fire company from granting any later charge having      priority over the floating charge and the person in whose favour such later charge was granted had notice of that prohibition at the time when the       charge was granted to him:

          Provided that a person is deemed to have notice of such prohibition in a floating charge where a notice indicating the existence of such prohibition   is registered with the Commission.

 

205.   Powers of the court

  (1)   Whenever a fixed or floating charge has become enforceable, the Court    may appoint a receiver and in the case of a floating charge, a receiver and        manager of the assets subject to the charge.

   (2)  In the case of a floating charge, the Court may, notwithstanding that the charge has not become enforceable, appoint a receiver or manager if it is          satisfied that the security of the debenture holder is in jeopardy, and the          security of the debenture holder shall be deemed to be in jeopardy if the    Court is satisfied that events have occurred or are about to occur which         render it unreasonable in the interests of the debenture holder that the         company should retain power to dispose of its assets.

   (3)  A receiver or manager shall not be appointed as a means of enforcing           debentures not secured by any charge.

 

206.   Advertisement of appointment of receiver and manager.

          Where a receiver or manager is appointed by the Court, advertisement to          this effect shall be made by the receiver or the receiver and manager in the      Federal Government Gazette and in two daily newspapers.

 

207.   Preferential payment to debenture holders in certain cases

    (1) Where a receiver is appointed on behalf of the holders of any debenture of        a registered company secured by a floating charge, or possession is taken   by, or on behalf of those debenture holders of any property comprising of      subject to the charge, then if the company is not at the time in the course        of being wound up, the debts which in every winding up are under the         provisions relating to preferential payments in section 657 to be paid in priority to all other debts, shall be paid out of any assets coming to the           hands of the receiver or other person taking possession in priority to any           claim for principal or interest in respect of the debentures.

   (2)  In the application of the provisions relating to preferential payments—

          (a)     section 657 shall be construed as if the provision for payment of                        accrued holiday remuneration becoming payable on die termination                             of employment before or by the effect of the winding-up order or                       resolution, were a provision for payment of such remuneration                                    becoming payable on the termination of employment before or by                     the effect of appointment of the receiver or possession being taken;                         and

          (b)     the periods of time mentioned is reckoned from the date of the                                     appointment of the receiver or of possession being taken, as the case                           may be, and if such date occurred before the commencement of this                             Act, the provisions relating to preferential payments which would                     have applied but for this Act, shall be deemed to remain in full force.

   (3)  Any payment made under this section shall be recouped as far as may be          out of the assets of the company available for payment of general creditors.

   (4)  Notwithstanding any provision in this Act or any other law to the contrary,      the holder of a fixed charge shall have priority over other debts of the company including preferential debts.

 

DEBENTURE TRUST DEED

208.   Execution of debenture trust deed.

   (1)  Every company which offers debentures to the public for subscription or           purchase shall, before issuing any of the debentures, execute a debenture trust deed in respect of them and procure the execution of the deed by the       trustee for the debenture holders appointed by the deed.

  (2)   No debenture trust deed shall cover more than one class of debentures,    whether or not the trust deed is required by this section to be executed.

  (3)   Where a trust deed is required to be executed by this section but has not been executed, the Court, on the application of a debenture holder          concerned, may—

          (a)     order the company to execute a trust deed;

          (b)     direct that a person nominated by the Court to be appointed as a                       trustee; and

          (c)      give such consequential directions as it deems fit, as to the contents                            of the trust deed and its execution by the trustee.

   (4)  For the purposes of this Act, debentures shall belong to different classes if           different rights attach to them in respect of—

          (a)     the rate of, or dates for payment of, interest;

          (b)     the dates when, or the instalments by which, the principal of the                        debenture shall be repaid, unless the difference is solely that the                         class of debentures shall be repaid during a stated period of time and                           particular debentures may be repaid at different dates during that                       period according to selections made by the company or by drawings,                          ballot or otherwise;

          (c)      any right to subscribe for or convert the debentures into shares in, or                           other debentures of, the company or any other company; or

          (d)     the powers of the debenture holders to realise any security.

  (5)   Debentures further belong to different classes, if they do not rank equally          for payment when any security invested in the debenture holders under         any trust deed is realised or when the company is wound up, if, in the    circumstances mentioned in subsection (4) the subject matter of any such       security or the proceeds, or any assets available to satisfy the debentures,   is or are not to be applied in satisfying the debentures strictly in proportion     to the amount of principal, premiums and arrears of interest to which the    holders of them are respectively entitled.

   (6)  A debenture is covered by a trust deed if the holder of the debenture is     entitled to

          (a)     participate in any money payable by the company under the deed; or

          (b)     the benefit of any mortgage, charge or security created by the deed,                             whether alone or together with other persons.

  (7)   If a company issues debentures in circumstances in which this section      requires a debenture trust deed to be executed, without such a deed       having been executed in compliance with this section, or if the company issues debentures under a trust deed which covers two or more classes of          debentures, the directors of the company who are in default commit an          offence and are liable jointly on conviction to such fine as the court deems    fit and in addition, the directors of the company shall be jointly severally           liable to such fines as the Commission shall specify in the regulation.

 

209. Contents of debenture trust deed.

(1)     Every debenture trust deed, whether required by section 208 or not, shall           state—

          (a)     the maximum sum which the company may raise by issuing                               debentures of the same class;

          (c)      the nature of any asset over which a mortgage, charge or security is                            created by the trust deed in favour of the trustee for the benefit of                      the debenture holders equally, and except where such a charge is a                     floating charge, the identity of the assets subject to it;

          (d)     the nature of any asset over which a mortgage, charge or security has                          been or will be created in favour of any person other than the trustee                           for the benefit of the debenture holders equally, and except where                      such a charge is a floating charge, the identity of the assets subject to                           it;

          (f)      any prohibition or restriction on the power of the company to issue                            debentures or create mortgages, charges or any security on any of its                           assets ranking in priority to, or equally with the debentures issued                     under the trust deed;

          (g)     whether the company has power to acquire debentures issued under                            the trust deed before the date of their redemption and to re-issue                        the debentures;

          (k)     the circumstances in which the debenture holders are entitled to                         realise any mortgage, charge or security vested in the trustee or any                             other person for their benefit (other than the circumstances in which                            they are entitled to do so by this Act);

          (l)      the powers of the company and the trustee to call meetings of the                       debenture holders and the rights of debenture holders to require the                             company or the trustee to call such meetings;

          (m)    whether the rights of debenture holders may be altered or abrogated                             and if so, the conditions which shall be fulfilled, and the procedure                              which shall be followed, to effect such an alteration or abrogation;

   (3)  Subsection (2) shall not apply if the debenture is the only debenture of the           class to which it belongs which has been or may be issued, and the rights of      the debenture holder may not be altered or abrogated without his consent.

   (1)  Every debenture covered by a debenture trust deed shall state, either in    the body or in a note forming part of the same document or endorsed therein—

          (a)     the matters required to be stated in a debenture trust deed by                                       section 209 (1) (a), (b), (f), (h), (i), (j), (1) and(m);

          (b)     whether the trustee of the covering debenture trust deed holds the                     mortgages, charges and securities vested in him by the trust deed in                             trust for the debenture holders equally, or in trust for some only of                              the debenture holders, and if so, which debenture holders; and

          (c)      whether the debenture is secured by a floating charge vested in the                     trustee of the covering debenture trust deed or in the debenture                                    holders.

   (2)  A debenture issued by a company shall state on its face in legible print, that      it is unsecured if no mortgage, charge or security is vested in the holder of      the debenture or in any other person for his benefit as security for payment    of principal or interest.

   (3)  Any director of a company who issues debenture in violation of the         provisions of subsections (1) and (2) is liable to such finesa as the          Commission shall specify in the regulation.

 

211.   Trustees for debenture holders

   (1)  Whether or not a debenture is secured by a charge over the company's     property, there may be created in relation to such debenture, a trust deed       appointing trustees for the debenture holders.

   (2)  It is the duty of such trustee to safeguard the rights of the debenture         holders and, on behalf of and for the benefit of the debenture holders,         exercise the rights, powers and discretions conferred upon him by the trust        deed.

   (3)  Charges securing the debentures may be created in favour of the     debenture holders by vesting them in the trustees.

   (4)  Any provision contained in a trust deed or in any contract with the holders       of debentures secured by a trust deed is void if it would have the effect of    exempting a trustee from, or indemnifying him against, liability for any    breach of trust or failure to show the degree of care and diligence required     of him as trustee having regard to the powers, authorities or discretions     conferred on him by the trust deed.

   (5)  In subsection (4), nothing is deemed to invalidate any release otherwise   validly given in respect of anything done or omitted to be done by a trustee         on the agreement to such release of a majority of at least three quarters in        value of the debenture holders present in person, or where proxies are permitted, by proxy at a meeting summoned for the purpose.

   (6)  Notwithstanding any provision contained in the debentures or trust deed,         the Court may, on the application of any debenture holder or of the     Commission, remove any trustee and appoint another in his place if    satisfied that such trustee has interests which conflicts or may conflict with those of the debenture holders or that for any reason it is undesirable that      such trustee should continue to act:

          Provided that where any such application is made by a debenture holder,          the Court if it deems fit, may order die applicant to give security for the        payment of the costs of the trustee and may direct that the application be      heard in Chambers.

 

212.   Disqualification for appointment as trustee of debenture trust deed

   (1)  A person is not qualified for appointment as a trustee of a debenture trust       deed if he is—

          (a)     an officer or employee of the company which issues debentures                                    covered by the trust deed or of a company in the same group of                                  companies as the company issuing debentures;

          (b)     less than 18 years of age;

          (d)     an undischarged bankrupt; or

          (a)     disqualified under section 283 from being appointed as a director of                           a company, but a corporation shall not be disqualified from being                      appointed as a trustee.

  (2)   If a trustee becomes subject to any of the disqualifications mentioned in   subsection (1) after he has been appointed, he shall immediately cease to         be qualified to act as a trustee of the debenture trust deed.

  (3)   Any person who acts as a trustee of a debenture trust deed whose appointment is invalid under subsection (1) or who is disqualified from         acting under subsection (2), commits an offence and is liable on conviction    as the Court deems fit, or to such fines as the Commission shall specify in       the regulation.

 

213.   Liability of trustees for debenture holders

   (1)  Subject to the provisions of this section, anything contained in a trust deed       for securing an issue of debentures, or in any contract with the holders of      debentures secured by a trust deed, is void if it would have the effect of exempting a trustee from or indemnifying him against liability for breach of   trust, where he fails to show the degree of care and diligence required of him as trustee, having regard to the provisions of the trust deed conferring     on him any power, authorities or discretion.

   (2)  Subsection (1) does not invalidate—

          (a)     any release validly given in respect of anything done or omitted to be                           done by a trustee before the giving of the release; or

          (b)     any provision enabling such a release to be given—

                   (i)      on the agreement of a majority of not less than three quarters                                      in value of the debenture holders present and voting in person                                     or, where proxies are permitted, by proxy at a meeting                                                summoned for that purpose, and

                   (ii)     either with respect to specific acts or omissions or on the                                             trustee dying or ceasing to act.

   (3)  Subsection (1) does not operate to—

          (a)     invalidate any provision in effect at the commencement of this Act in                          any such trust deed or contract, provided that any person entitled to                           the benefit of that provision, or afterwards given the benefit thereof                            under subsection (4), remains a trustee of the trust deed in question;                            or

          (b)     deprive any person of any exemption or right to be indemnified in                     respect of anything done or omitted to be done by him, while any                      such provision was in effect.

   (4)  While any trustee of a trust deed remains entitled to the benefit of a

          provision exempted by subsection (3), the benefit of that provision may be           given—

          (a)     to all trustees of the deed, present and future; or

          (b)     to any named trustee or proposed trustee, by a resolution, passed by                           a majority of at least three-quarters in value of the debenture                                       holders present in person or, where proxies are permitted by proxy                            at a meeting summoned for that purpose in accordance with the                                   provisions of the trust deed or, if the trust deed makes no provision                            for summoning meetings, a meeting summoned for that purpose in                             any manner approved by the Court.

   (1)  Except as expressly provided in the terms of any debenture, debentures   shall be transferable without restriction by a written transfer in any usual or         common form, or any other form which the directors of the company may    approve, and that die transferee is entitled to the debenture and to the money secured thereby without regard to any equity, set-off or cross-claim      between the company and the original, or any intermediate, holder.

   (2)  The terms of any debenture may impose restrictions of any nature on the           transferability of debentures, including power for the company to refuse to           register any transfer and provisions for compulsory acquisition or rights of      first refusal in favour of other debenture holders, or members or officers of     the company:

          Provided that if any restriction is imposed on the right to transfer any     debenture, notice of the restriction shall be endorsed on the face of die    debenture or debenture stock certificate and in the absence of such          endorsement, the restriction shall be ineffective as regards any transferee         for value, whether or not he has notice of the restriction.

222.   Registration of charges created by companies

    (1) Subject to the provisions of this Part, every charge created by a company,

          being a charge to which this section applies, shall, so far as any security on       the company's property or undertaking is conferred, be void against the        liquidator and any creditor of the company, unless the prescribed       particulars of the charge (including any provisions in a floating charge that     prohibits or restricts the company from granting any further charge ranking in priority to or paripassu with the floating charge) together with the instrument, if any, by which the charge is created or evidenced, have been or are delivered to or received by the Commission for registration in the manner required by this Act or by any enactment repealed by this Act        within 90 days after the date of its creation, but without prejudice to any     contract or obligation for repayment of the money thereby secured, and     when a charge becomes void under this section, the money thereby      secured shall immediately become payable and registration under this   section shall give rise to constructive notice of the matters stated in the           particulars of charge

   (2)  The provisions of this section apply to a—

          (a)     charge for the purpose of securing any issue of debentures;

          (b)     charge on uncalled share capital of the company;

          (c)      charge created or evidenced by an instrument which if executed

                   by an individual would require registration as a bill of sale;

          (d)     charge on land, wherever situate, or any interest therein, but not

                   including a charge for rent or other periodical sum issuing out of                        land;

          (e)      charge on book debts of the company;

          (f)      floating charge on the undertaking or property of the company;

          (g)     charge on calls made but not paid;

          (h)     charge on a ship or aircraft or any share in a ship; and

          (i)      charge on goodwill, or on any intellectual property.

   (3)  Where a charge affects or relates to property situate in Nigeria and in      addition to registration under subsection (1), registration elsewhere in          Nigeria is necessary to make the charge valid or effectual, it shall, subject to    this subsection, be sufficient evidence of compliance with the requirements     of subsection (1), if, instead of delivery of the original instrument creating        or evidencing the charge, there is delivered to and received by the     Commission within the prescribed period of 90 days, or such extended time   as the Court may allow, a true copy of it duly certified as such by the      secretary to the company.

   (4)  A reference in any enactment to the date of execution of an instrument for         the purposes of computation of time within which registration is to be           effected with or without penalty, shall be construed as a reference to the        date of presentation of a copy of the instrument to the Commission under          this Act, and time shall be computed accordingly, and if a certified copy is delivered to the Commission under this subsection, the original of it shall     be produced to the Commission for inspection and comparison, if the          Commission so requires.

   (5)  In the case of a charge created out of Nigeria, affecting or in relation to    property situate outside Nigeria, the delivery to and the receipt by the Commission of a copy verified in the prescribed manner of the instrument       by which the charge is created or evidenced, shall have the same effect for    the purposes of this section as the delivery and receipt of the instrument         itself, and 90 days after the date on which die instrument or copy could, in      due course of post, and if dispatched with diligence, have been received in       Nigeria shall be substituted for 90 days after the date of the creation of the           charge as the time within which the particulars and instrument or copy are        to be delivered to the Commission.

   (6)  Where a charge is created in Nigeria but affects or relates to property       outside Nigeria, the instrument creating or purporting to create the charge maybe sent for registration under this section, notwithstanding that further   proceedings may be necessary to make the charge valid or effectual    according to the law of the country in which the property is situate.

  (7)   Where a negotiable instrument has been given to secure the payment of   any book debts of a company, the deposit of the instrument for the      purpose of securing an advance to die company shall not, under this      section, be treated as a charge on those book debts.

(8)     The holding of debentures entitling the holder to a charge on land is not, for the purposes of this section, deemed to be an interest in land.

(9)     Where a series of debentures containing, or giving by reference to any      other instrument, any charge to the benefit of which the debenture holders        of that series are entitled paripassu is created by a company, it is, for the        purposes of this section, sufficient if there are delivered to or received by the Commission within 90 days after the execution of the deed containing       the charge or, if there is no such deed, after the execution of any debenture      of the series, the following particulars—

          (a)     the total amount secured by the whole series;

          (b)     the dates of the resolutions authorising the issues of the series and                     the date of the covering deed, if any, by which the security is created                           or defined;

          (c)      a general description of the property charged; and

          (d)     the names of the trustees, if any, for the debenture holders,                                together with the deed containing the charge, or, if there is no such                     deed, one of the debentures of the series:

          Provided that, where more than one issue is made of debentures in the     series, there shall be sent to the Commission, for entry in the register,       particulars of the date and amount of each issue, but an omission to do this   does not affect the validity of the debentures issued.

  (10) Where any commission, allowance or discount has been paid or made      either directly or indirectly by a company to any person in consideration of       his subscribing or agreeing to subscribe, whether absolutely or   conditionally, for any debenture of the company, or procuring or agreeing   to procure subscriptions, whether absolute or conditional, for such      debentures, the particulars required to be sent for registration under this   section shall include particulars as to the amount or rate percent of           commission, discount or allowance paid or made, but an omission to do this does not affect the validity of the debentures issued.

  (11) The deposit of any debenture as security for any debt of the company shall       not, for the purposes of subsection (10), be treated as the issue of the    debentures at a discount.

  (12) The total fees payable to the Commission in connection with the filing,           registration or release of a charge with the Commission under this Part shall     not exceed 0.3 5 % of the value of the charge or such other amount as the      Minister may specify in the Federal Government Gazette.

          (d)     the collateral-provider and the collateral-taker are both non-natural                             persons.

   (1)  It is the duty of a company to send to the Commission for registration, the           particulars of every charge created by the company and of the issues of           debentures of a series requiring registration under section 222, but registration of any such charge may be effected on the application of any     person interested therein.

   (2)  Where registration is effected on the application of a person other than the           company, that person is entitled to recover from the company the amount        of any fees properly paid by him to the Commission on the registration.

   (3)  If any company defaults in sending to the Commission for registration, the           particulars of any charge created by the company or of the issues of           debentures of a series requiring registration, unless the registration has    been effected on the application of some other person, the company and          each officer of the company who is in default commits an offence and are    liable to such penalty as may be prescribed by the Commission..

 

225.   Duty of company acquiring property to register subsisting charges.

  (1)   Where a company acquires any property which is subject to a charge of any     such kind as would, if it has been created by the company after the         acquisition of the property, have been required to be registered under this         Part, the company shall cause the prescribed particulars of the charge,     together with a copy (certified in the prescribed manner to be a correct     copy) of the instrument, if any, by which the charge was created or is evidenced, to be delivered to the Commission for registration in the           manner required by this Act within 90 days after the date on which           acquisition is completed:

          Provided that, if the property is situate and the charge was created outside           Nigeria, 90 days after the date on which the copy of the instrument could in      due course of post, and if despatched with due diligence, have been       received in Nigeria shall be substituted for 90 days after the completion of          the acquisition, as the time within which the particulars and the copy of the instrument are to be delivered to the Commission.

   (2)  If default is made in complying with this section, the company and each officer of the company are liable to such penalty as may be prescribed by      the Commission for every day during which the default continues.

  (3)   It is sufficient compliance with this section in any case affecting land        registered under any enactment in a State, where the charge is registered         before the land is acquired by the company, if a true copy of the charge duly certified by the Registrar of Land is delivered to the Commission within        the time prescribed by this section.

 

226.   Existing charges

  (1)   Where, at the date of commencement of this Act, a company has property        on which there is a charge, particulars of which would require registration if          it had been created by the company after the date of such commencement,        then, unless the charge has been discharged or the property has ceased to        be held by the company prior to the expiration of six months from the date      of such commencement, the company shall, within that time, cause   particulars of the charge as prescribed by section 222 to be delivered to the     Commission for registration together with the document, if any, by which          the charge was created or a copy thereof, certified as required by that           section.

          (b)     at least three members present in person or by proxy;

          (c)      a member or members present in person or by proxy and                                   representing at least one tenth of the total voting rights of all the                        members having the right to vote at the meeting; or

   (4)  A poll demanded on the election of a chairman or on a question of adjournment is taken immediately, and on any other question is taken at       such time as the chairman of the meeting directs, and any business other         than that upon which a poll has been demanded may be proceeded with    pending the taking of the poll.

   (3)  A member of unsound mind, or in respect of whom an order has been      made by any court having jurisdiction in lunacy, may vote, whether on a      show of hands or on a poll, by his committee, receiver curator bonis, or          other person in the nature of a committee, receiver or curator bonis           appointed by that court, and any such committee, receiver, curator bonis    or other person may vote by proxy.

  (3)   Any provision contained in a company's articles is void in so far as it would           have the effect of requiring the instrument appointing a proxy or any other           document necessary to show the validity of the appointment of a proxy, to       be received by the company or any other person more than 48 hours before a meeting or adjourned meeting in order that the appointment may be effective at the meeting.

  (5)   A vote given in accordance with the terms of an instrument of proxy is valid           notwithstanding the previous death, insanity of the principal, revocation of      the proxy or of the authority under which the proxy was executed, the          transfer of the share in respect of which the proxy is given, where no intimation in writing of such death, insanity, revocation or transfer is     received by the company before the commencement of the meeting or adjourned meeting at which the proxy is used.

          (b)     send a copy of the representations to every member of the company                           to whom notice of the meeting is sent (whether before or after                            receipt of the representations by the company), and if a copy of the                             representations is not sent as required in this section because it is                       received too late or because of the company's default, the director                      may (without prejudice to his right to be heard orally) require that                             the representations are read out at the meeting:

                   Provided that copies of the representations need not be sent out and                  the representations need not be read out at the meeting if, on the                        application either of the company or any other person who claims to                          be aggrieved, the court is satisfied that the rights conferred by this                     section are being abused to secure needless publicity for defamatory                            matter and the court may order the company's costs on an                                 application under this section to be paid in whole or in part by the                              director, notwithstanding that he is not a party to the application.

  (4)   A vacancy created by the removal of a director under this section, if not filled at the meeting at which he is removed, may be filled as a casual          vacancy.

  (5)   A person appointed director in place of a person removed under this       section is treated, for the purpose of determining the time at which he or        any other director is to retire, as if he had become director on the day on          which the person in whose place he is appointed was last appointed a    director.

  (6)   Nothing in this section is taken as depriving a person removed under it of           compensation or damages payable to him in respect of the termination of          his appointment as a director or of any appointment terminating with that    as director, or as derogating from any power to remove a director which          may exist apart from this section.

          (a)     a director is acting as agent of a particular shareholder; or

          (b)     though, he is not an agent of any shareholder, such a shareholder or                           other person is dealing with the company's securities.

  (3)   A director shall act at all times in what he believes to be the best interests          of the company as a whole so as to preserve its assets, further its business, and promote the purposes for which it was formed, and in such manner as      a faithful, diligent, careful and ordinarily skilful director would act in the    circumstances and, in doing so, shall have regard to the impact of the      company's operations on the environment in the community where it       carries on business operations.

   (4)  The matters to which a director of a company is to have regard in the           performance of his functions include the interests of the company's          employees in general, as well as the interests of its members.

   (5)  A director shall exercise his powers for the purpose for which he is specified    and shall not do so for a collateral purpose, and the power, if exercised for    the right purpose, does hot constitute a breach of duty, if it, incidentally,      affects a member adversely.

  (6)   A director shall not fetter his discretion to vote in a particular way.

  (7)   Where a director is allowed to delegate his powers under any provision of

          this Act, such a director shall not delegate the power in such a way and   manner as may amount to an abdication of duty.        )

  (8)   No provision, whether contained in the articles, resolutions of a company,        or any contract, shall relieve any director from the duty to act in         accordance with this section or relieve him from any liability incurred as a   result of any breach of the duties conferred upon him under this section.

306.   Conflicts of duties and interests

          (a)     in the course of management of affairs of the company, or

  (4)   The duty not to misuse corporate information does not cease by a director        or an officer having resigned from the company, and he is still accountable and can be restrained by an injunction from misusing the information     received by virtue of his previous position.

  (5)   Where a director discloses his interests before the transaction and before the secret profits are made before the general meeting, which may or may      not authorise any resulting profits, he may escape liability, but he does not       escape liability if he discloses only after he has made the secret profits, and      in this case, he shall account for the profits.

 

 

307.   Multiple directorships

  (1)   The fact that a person holds more than one directorship shall not derogate           from, his fiduciary duties to each company, including a duty not to use the           property, opportunity or information obtained in the course of the           management of one company for the benefit of the other company, or to his own or other person's advantage.

  (2)   Failure to take reasonable care in accordance with the provisions of this section, is a ground for an action for negligence and breach of duty.

  (3)   Each director is individually responsible for the actions of the board in    which he participated, and the absence from the board's deliberations,           unless         justified, does not relieve a director of such responsibility.

   (4)  The same standard of care in relation to the director's duties to the          company shall be required for both executive and non-executive directors:

          Provided that additional liability and benefit may arise under the master and servant law in the case of an executive director if there is an express or    implied contract to that effect

          (d)     a person acting in his capacity as partner of that director or of any                             person who, by virtue of paragraphs (a), (b) or (c), is connected with                          that director.

313.   Prohibition of secret benefits.

   (1)  A director shall not accept a bribe, a gift, or commission either in cash or          kind

          (a)     a person acting in his capacity as partner of that director or of any                             person who, by virtue of paragraphs (a), (b) or (c), is connected with                          that director from any person or a share in file profit of that person                            in respect of any transaction involving his company in order to                                   introduce his company to deal with such a person.

  (2)   If a director contravenes the provisions of subsection (1), he commits a   breach of duty and the company shall recover from the director the actual     gift and sue him and the other person for damages sustained without any     deduction in respect of what the director has returned.

   (3)  Where the gift is made after the transaction has been completed in a form          of unsolicited gift as a sign of gratitude, the director may be allowed to        keep the gift, provided he declares it before the board and that fact shall    also appear in the minutes book of the directors.

  (4)   In all cases concerning secret benefits, the plea that the company    benefitted or that the gift was accepted in good faith is not a defence.

371.   Power to require information as to persons interested in shares, etc.

  (1)   Where it is made to appear to the Commission that there is good reason to           investigate the ownership of any share in or debenture of a company and          that it is unnecessary to appoint an inspector for the purpose, the         Commission may require any person who it has reasonable cause to believe      to —

          (a)     be or to have been interested in those shares or debentures;

          (b)     act or to have acted in relation to those shares or debentures as a                       legal practitioner or an agent of someone interested therein; or

          (c)      give to the Commission any information which the person has or                       might reasonably be expected to obtain as to the present and past                      interest in those shares or debentures and the names and addresses                              of the persons interested, and of any persons who act or have acted                             on their behalf in relation to the shares or debentures.

  (2)   For the purposes of this section, a person is deemed to have an interest in a           share or debenture if he has any right to acquire or dispose of the share or           debenture or any interest therein or to vote in respect thereof, or if his     consent is necessary for the exercise of any of the rights of other persons        interested therein, or if other persons interested therein can be required or       are accustomed to exercise their rights in accordance with his instructions.

372.   Power to impose restrictions on shares, etc.

   (1)  Where, in connection with an investigation under section 369 or 371, it   appears to the Commission that there is difficulty in finding out the        relevant facts about any share (whether issued or to be issued), and that   the difficulty is due wholly or mainly to the unwillingness of the persons       concerned, or any of them, to assist the investigation as required by this         Act the Commission may in writing direct that the shares shall, until further          notice, be subject to the restrictions imposed by this section.

   (2)  If shares are directed to be subject to the restrictions imposed by this       section

          (a)     any transfer of those shares, or in case of unissued shares, any                                    transfer of the right to be issued therewith and any issue thereof, is                             void;

          (b)     no voting rights are exercisable in respect of those shares;

          (c)      no further shares shall be issued in right of those shares or in                                      pursuance of any offer made to the holder of shares; and

          (d)     except in a liquidation, no payment shall be made of any sums due                             from the company on those shares, whether in respect of capital or                             otherwise.

  (3)   Where the Commission directs shares to be subject to restrictions under this section, or refuses to direct that shares shall cease to be subject       thereto, any person aggrieved thereby may appeal to the Court, and the     Court may, if it deems fit, direct that the shares shall cease to be subject to the said restrictions.

  (4)   Any direction or order of the Court that shares shall cease to be subject to           restrictions under this section, expressed to be made with a view to          permitting a transfer of those shares, may continue the restrictions         mentioned in subsection (2) (c) and (d), either in whole or in part, so far as    they relate to any right acquired or offer made before the transfer.

  (5)   Any person who—

          (a)     exercises or purports to exercise any right to dispose of shares                                    which, to his knowledge, are for the time being subject to restrictions                           under this section,

          (b)     votes in respect of such shares, whether as holder or proxy, or                                    appoints a proxy to vote in respect thereof, or

          (c)      being the holder of such shares, fails to notify that they are subject to                          the said restrictions, commits an offence and is liable to a penalty as                           the Commission shall specify in its regulations.

  (6)   Where shares in any company are issued in contravention of the said           restrictions, the company and each officer of the company who are in      default commits an offence and is liable to a penalty as the Commission     shall specify in its regulations.

   (7)  A prosecution shall not be instituted under this section except by or with          the consent of the Attorney-General of the Federation.

  (8)   This section applies in relation to debentures as it applies in relation to   shares.

   (8)  If, owing to special circumstances in the case of any company, compliance        with any such requirement in relation to the balance sheet or profit and loss account would prevent compliance with subsection (2), (even if additional information were provided in accordance with subsection (4)),       the directors shall depart from that requirement in preparing the balance    sheet or profit and loss account (so far as necessary) in order to comply       with subsection (2).

  (3)   A group financial statement may not deal with a subsidiary, if the directors       of the company are of the opinion that—

          (b)     it would involve expense or delay out of proportion to its value to                     members of the company;

          (c)      the result would be misleading, or harmful to the business of the                        company or any of its subsidiaries; or

          (d)     the business of the holding company and that of the subsidiary are so                different that they cannot reasonably be treated as a single                                  undertaking.

(4)     The group financial statements of a company shall consist of a       consolidated—

  (5)   If the directors are of the opinion that it is better for the purpose of          presenting the same or equivalent information about the state of affairs and profit or loss of the company and its subsidiaries, and that to so       present it may be readily appreciated by the members of the company, the     group financial statements may be prepared in a form not consistent with        subsection (1) and in particular the group financial statement may consist        of—

          (a)     more than one set of consolidated financial statements dealing                                      respectively with the company and one group of subsidiaries and                       with other groups of subsidiaries;

          (b)     all the requirements of this Act as to the matters to be included in                      group financial statements or in notes to those statements and                            accordingly subsections (4) and (5) shall have effect.

  (4)   If group financial statements are not in accordance with the requirements          of this Act by not providing sufficient information in compliance with         subsection (2), any necessary additional information shall be provided in, or          in a note to, the group financial statements.

  (5)   If, owing to special circumstances in the case of any company, compliance        with any such requirements in relation to its group financial statements would prevent the statements from complying with subsection (2), (even if        additional information were provided in accordance with subsection (4)),       the directors may depart from that requirement in preparing the group financial statements.

  (2)   The directors of the holding company may not under section 396 of this Act           deliver financial statements modified as for a small company, unless the group (that is to say, the holding company and its subsidiaries together) is         in that year a small group and the group is small if it qualifies under section        394 of this Act (applying that section as provided under subsections (3) and          (4), as if it were all one company).

  (3)   The figures to be taken into account in determining whether the group is small are the group account figures, that is—

  (4)   In the case of each subsidiary omitted from the group financial statements,        the figures relevant as regards turnover, and balance sheet total are those      which are included in the financial statements of that subsidiary prepared      in respect of its relevant year (with such adjustment as would have been        made if those figures had been included in group financial statements         prepared in consolidated form).

  (5)   For the purposes of subsection (4), the relevant year of the subsidiary is—

          (a)     if its year ends with that of die holding company to which the group                           financial statements relate, that year; and

          (b)     if not, the subsidiary's year ending last before the end of the year of                            the holding company.

          (a)     consolidated, may be in accordance with Part II of the Sixth Schedule                         (while otherwise comprising or corresponding with group financial                             statements prepared under section 379 of this Act); and

          (b)     not consolidated, may be such as (together with any notes) give the                             same or equivalent information as required by paragraph (a), and                      Part III to the Sixth Schedule to this Act applies to modified group                              financial statements whether consolidated or not.

          (b)     at no such time has it been the holding company of a company that                            was then limited.

  (2)   A small company is exempted from the requirements imposed by section          422 provided that it complies with the provision of section 394 of this Act.

  (3)   The general meeting has power to decrease the amount of dividend           recommended by the directors, but has no power to increase the     recommended amount.

  (4)   Where the recommendation of the directors of a company with respect to the           declaration of a dividend is varied in accordance with subsection (3) by the           company in general meeting, a statement to that effect shall be included in         the relevant annual return.

  (2)   The profits of a company available for payment of dividends are its           accumulated, realised profits (so far as not previously utilised by distribution   or capitalisation), less - its accumulated, realised losses (so far as not previously written off in a lawfully made reduction or reorganisation of         capital)

428.   Restriction on declaration and payment of dividends.

 (2)    After the expiration of three months of the publication and notice referred to    in subsection (1), the company may invest the unclaimed dividend for its     own benefit in investments outside the company and no interest shall accrue         on the dividends against the company.

  (3)   Where dividends have been sent to members and there is an omission to send to some members due to the fault of the company, the dividends shall          earn interest at the current bank rate from three months after the date on      which they ought to have been posted.

  (4)   For the purpose of liability, the date of posting the dividend warrant is    deemed to be the date of payment and proof of whether it has been sent is a    question of fact.

 

430.   Reserve and capitalisation

  (1)   The directors may, before recommending any dividend, set aside out of the           profits of the company such sums as they think proper as a reserve or     reserves which shall, at the discretion of the directors, be applicable for any          purpose to which the profits of the company may be properly applied, and     pending such application may, at the discretion, either be employed in the business of the company or be invested in such investments (other than         shares of the company) as the directors think fit, and the directors may         without placing the same to reserve, carry forward any profits which they   may think prudent not to distribute.

  (2)   The company in general meeting may upon the recommendation of the    directors resolve that it is desirable to capitalise any part of the amount, for the time being, standing to the credit of any of the company's reserve accounts or to the credit of the profit and loss account or available for      distribution.

  (3)   Such sum may be set free for distribution among the members who would           have been entitled to dividends in the same proportions on condition that the           same be not paid in cash but be applied either on or towards paying up any           amount unpaid on any shares held by such members respectively or paying      up in full unissued shares or debentures of the company to be allotted and    distributed to creditors as fully paid up.

  (4)   The company may decide by a resolution, what part shall be distributed in        cash or in shares and the directors shall give effect to such resolution.

  (5)   Share premium account and a capital redemption reserve fund may, for the           purposes of this subsection, only be applied in the paying up of unissued           shares to be issued to members of the company as fully paid bonus shares.

  (6)   Where a resolution under subsections (2) - (5) is passed, the directors shall            make all appropriations and applications of the undivided profits resolved to   be capitalised thereby, and all allotments and issues of fully- paid shares or debentures, if any, and generally do all acts and things required to give effect       to it.

  (7)   The directors shall have power to make such provision by the issue of     fractional certificates or by payment in cash or otherwise as they think fit in the case of shares or debentures becoming distributable in fractions.

  (8)   Any person may be authorised by the directors to enter on behalf of all the           members entitled under this section into an agreement with the company to           provide for the allotment to them respectively, credited as fully paid up, of       any further shares or debentures to which they may be entitled upon such      capitalisation, or (as the case may require) for the payment by the company    on their behalf, of the amount or any part of the amount remaining unpaid on         their existing shares, and any agreement made under such authority is    effective and binding on all such members.

 

431.   Employees’ shares and profit sharing.

          If under his contract of service, an employee is entitled to share in the profits    of the company as an incentive, he is entitled to share in the profits of the    company, whether or not dividends have been declared.

432.   Right of the shareholders to sue for dividends.

  (1)   Dividends are special debts due to and recoverable by shareholders within        12 years, and actionable only when declared.

  (2)   Dividends that are unclaimed after 12 years should be included in the profits    that should be distributed to the other shareholders of the company.

 

433.   Liability for paying dividend out of capital

  (1)   All directors who knowingly pay, or are party to the payment of dividend        out of capital or in contravention of this Part, are personally liable jointly      and severally to refund to the company any amount so paid.

          Such directors shall have the right to recover the dividend from shareholders    who receive it with knowledge that the company had no power to pay it.

          (b)     the objective specified in subsection (1) (b) would achieve a better                     result for the company’s creditors as a whole.

          (b)     that at the time it did so there were reasonable grounds for believing                           that the transaction would benefit the company.

  (7)   Where a company enters into a transaction at an undervalue at a time      mentioned in subsection (6) (a), that time is not a relevant time for the   purposes of this section unless the company—

          (a)     is at that time unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section                             572;or

          (b)     becomes unable to pay its debts within the meaning of that section in                          consequence of the transaction or preference, but the requirements of                          this subsection are presumed to be satisfied, unless the contrary is                     shown, in relation to any transaction at an undervalue which is entered             into by a company with a person who is connected with the company.

CHAPTER 27—ARRANGEMENTS AND COMPROMISE

710.   Definition of arrangement.

          In this Chapter, the word "arrangement" means any change in the rights or           liabilities of members, debenture holders or creditors of a company or any           class of them or in the regulation of a company, other than a change effected           under any other provision of this Act or by the unanimous agreement of all           parties affected.

 

711.   Arrangement or compromise between two or more companies.

  (1)   Where under a scheme proposed for a compromise, arrangement or           reconstruction between two or more companies or the merger of any two or           more companies, the whole or any part of the undertaking or the property of    any company concerned in the scheme (in this section referred to as "the        transfer of company") is to be transferred to another company, the Court        may, on the application in summary of any of the companies to be affected,      order separate meetings of the companies to be summoned in such manner as the Court may direct.

  (2)   If a majority representing at least three-quarter in value of the share of     members being present and voting either in person or by proxy at each of the         separate meetings, agree to the scheme, an application may be made to the   Court by one or more of the companies, and the Court shall sanction the       scheme.

  (3)   When the scheme is sanctioned by the Court, it becomes binding on the           companies, and the Court may, by the order sanctioning the scheme or by         any subsequent order, make provision for—

          (a)     the transfer to the transferee company of the whole or any part of the                         undertaking and of the property or liabilities of any transferor                                    company;

          (b)     the allotting or appropriation by the transferee company of shares,                             debentures, policies or other like interests in that company which                       under the compromise or arrangement are to be allotted or                                 appropriated by that company to or for any person;

          (c)      the continuation by or against the transferee company of legal                                     proceedings pending by or against any transferor company;

          (d)     the dissolution, without winding up, of any transferor company;

          (e)      the provision to be made for any persons who in such manner as the                          court may direct, dissent from the compromise or arrangement; and

          (f)      such incidental, consequential and supplemental matters as are                                   necessary to secure that the reconstruction or merger shall be fully and              effectively carried out.

  (4)   An order under subsection (3) (d) shall not be made unless—

          (a)     the whole of the undertaking and the property, assets and liabilities of              the transferor company are being transferred into the transferee                                   company; and

          (b)     the Court is satisfied that adequate provision by way of compensation                       or otherwise have been made with respect to the employees of the                      company to be dissolved.

  (5)   Where an order under this section provides for the transfer of property or           liabilities, that property or liabilities shall, by virtue of the order, be           transferred to and become the property or liabilities of the transferee       company, and in the case of any property, if the order so directs, freed from   any charge which is by virtue of the compromise or arrangement to cease to    have effect.

  (6)   Where an order is made under this section, every company in relation to which the order is made shall cause an office copy of the order to be     delivered to the Commission for registration within seven days after the          making of the order, and a notice of the order shall be published in the          Federal Government Gazette and in at least one national newspaper and if in   default shall be liable to a fine in such amount as may be prescribed by the Commission in its regulations.

  (7)   In this section —

          (a)     "property" includes property rights and powers of every description;

          (b)     "liabilities" includes rights, powers and duties of every description                     notwithstanding that such rights, powers and duties are of a personal                          character which could not generally be assigned or performed                                      vicariously; and

          (c)      "company" where used in this section does not include any company                          other than a company within the meaning of this Act.

712.   Provisions applicable to schemes or contract involving transfer of         shares in a company. Cap. 124, LFN, 2004.

  (1)   Where a scheme or contract, not being a take-over bid under the Investment      and Securities Act involving the transfer of shares or any class of shares in a company (in this section referred to as “the transfer of company”) to another   company, whether a company within the meaning of this Act or not (in this          section referred to as 'the transferee company') has, within four months after      the making of the offer in that behalf by the transferee company been       approved by the holders of at least nine-tenth in value of the shares of the     company (other than shares already held at the date of the offer by a    nominee for the transferee company, or its subsidiary), the transferee           company may at any time within two months after the expiration of the said    four months give notice in the prescribed manner to any dissenting        shareholder that it desires to acquire his shares.

  (2)   When a notice under subsection (1) is given, the transferee company is,   unless on an application made by the dissenting shareholder within one         month from the date on which the notice was given, unless the Court deems          fit to order otherwise, entitled and bound to acquire those shares on the         terms on which, under the scheme or contract, the shares of the approving     shareholders are to be transferred to the transferee company.

  (3)   Where shares in the transferor company of the said class or classes as the           shares whose transfer is involved are already held as specified in subsection      (1) to a value greater than one-tenth of the aggregate of their value and that   of die share (other than those already held as specified in that subsection)         whose transfer is involved, the provisions of this section do not apply    unless—

          (a)     the transferee company offers the same terms to all holders of the                      shares (other than those already held) whose transfer is involved, or                            where those shares include shares of different classes, of each class of                          them; and

          (b)     the holders who approve the scheme or contracts besides holding at                            least nine-tenth in value of the shares (other than those already held as              aforesaid) whose transfer is involved, shall be at least three- quarters                           in number of the holders of those shares.

   (4)  Where a notice has been given by the transferee company under                         subsection (1) and the Court has not, on an application made by the        dissenting shareholder, ordered to the contrary, the transferee company          shall—

          (a)     on the expiration of one month from the date on which the notice has                         been given or if an application to the Court by the dissenting                                       shareholder is then pending after that application has been disposed                           of, transmit a copy of the notice to the transferor company together                            with an instrument of transfer executed on behalf of the shareholder                           by any person appointed by the transferee company and on its behalf                         by the transferee company; and

          (b)     pay or transfer to the transferor company the amount or other                                    consideration representing the price payable by the transferee                                     company for the shares which by virtue of this section that company is             entitled to acquire, and the transferor company shall thereupon                                   register the transferee company as the holder of those shares.

  (5)   Any sum received by the transferor company under this section shall be paid    into a separate bank account, and such sums and any other consideration so received shall be held by that company on trust for the several persons entitled to the shares in respect of which the said sums or other   consideration, were respectively received.

  (6)   In this section, "dissenting shareholder" includes a shareholder who has not           assented to the scheme or contract and any shareholder who has failed or           refused to transfer to the transferee company in accordance with the scheme     or contract.

 

713.   Provisions applicable to dissenting shareholders

  (1)   This section applies where, in pursuance of any such scheme or contract,           shares in a company are transferred to another company or its nominee, and           those shares together with any other shares in the first mentioned company      held by, or by a nominee for the transferee company or its subsidiary at the    date of the transfer comprise or include nine-tenth in value of the shares in      the first mentioned company or of a class of those shares.

(2)     The transferee company shall, within one month from the date of the transfer           (unless on a previous transfer in pursuance of the scheme or contract it has           already complied with this requirement), give notice of that fact in the      prescribed manner to the holder of the remaining shares or of the remaining    shares of that class, as the case may be, who have not assented to the scheme or contract.

  (3)   A holder may, within three months from the giving of the notice to him, require the transferee company to acquire the shares in question.

  (4)   If a shareholder gives notice under subsection (3) with respect to any share,      the transferee company is entitled and bound to acquire those shares on the terms on which under the scheme or contract the shares of the approving      shareholders were transferred to it, or on such other terms as may be agreed      on as the Court hearing the application of either the transferee company or   the shareholder deems fit.

 

714.   Arrangement on sale of company’s property during members'    voluntary winding-up

  (1)   With a view to effecting any arrangement, a company may by special      resolution resolve that the company be put into members' voluntary winding up and that the liquidator be authorised to sell the whole or part of it under taking or assets to another body corporate, whether a company within the   meaning of this Act or not (in this section called "the transferee company")      in consideration or part consideration of frilly paid shares, and to distribute          the same in specie among the members of the company in accordance with   their rights in the liquidation.

  (2)   Any sale or distribution in pursuance of a special resolution under this    section is binding on the company and all its members and each member       shall be deemed to have agreed with the transferee company to accept the           fully paid shares, debentures, policies, cash or other like interests to which       he is entitled under such distribution:

          Provided that if—

          (a)     within one year from the date of the passing of any special resolution                         as is referred to in subsection (1), an order is made under sections 353                        - 355 of this Act dealing with relief on the grounds of unfairly                                     prejudicial and oppressive conduct or for the winding up of the                                   company under a creditors' voluntary winding up, the arrangement for              the sale and distribution shall not be valid unless sanctioned by the                             Court; or

          (b)     any member of the company, by writing addressed to the liquidator                            and left at the registered office or head office of the company, within                           30 days after the passing of the resolution, dissents in respect of any                          of the shares held by him, the liquidator shall either abstain from                       carrying the resolution into effect or shall purchase such shares at a                             price to be determined in the manner provided by subsection (4).

  (3)   Any member who fails to signify his dissent in accordance with subsection

          (2) is deemed to have accepted the resolution.

  (4)   If the liquidator elects to purchase the shares of any member who has      expressed his dissent in accordance with subsection (2), the price payable       shall be determined by agreement in the case of a private company in which    aliens do not participate, and in the case of a public company or a private        company in which aliens participate, by the Securities and Exchange          Commission:

          Provided that in the case of a private company in which no aliens   participate—

          (a)     such price is determined by estimating what the member concerned                             would have received had the whole of the undertaking of the company               been sold as a going concern for cash to a willing buyer and the                          proceeds, less the cost of winding up, been divided amongst the                         members in accordance with their rights; and

          (b)     the purchase money is paid by the company before the company is                             dissolved and be raised by the liquidator or, in default of any direction              in the special resolution, in such manner as he may think fit as part of                         the expenses of the winding up.

  (5)   Nothing contained in this section authorises any variation or abrogation of •     the rights of any creditor of the company.

  (6)   If any company, otherwise than under this section, sells or resolves to sell         the whole or part of its undertaking or assets to another body corporate in    consideration or part consideration of any shares, debentures, policies or        other like interest in that body corporate, and resolves to distribute the same      in specie among members of the company (whether in liquidation or by way        of dividend), any member of the company may by notice in writing          addressed to the company and left at the registered office or head office of        the company within 30 days after the passing of the resolution authorising such distribution, require the company either to abstain from carrying the           resolution into effect or to purchase any of his shares at a price to be           determined in the manner provided by subsection (4).

  (7)   Nothing contained in subsection (6) authorises any company to purchase its     own shares or make any distributions to its shareholders except in         accordance with the provisions of this Act.

 

 

715.   Power to compromise with creditors and members.

  (1)   Where a compromise or arrangement is proposed between a company and       its creditors or any class of them, the Court may, on the application, in a     summary way, of the company or any of its creditors or members or, in the case of a company being wound up, of the liquidator, order a meeting of the       creditors or class of creditors, or of the members of the company, or class of   members, as the case may be, to be summoned in such a manner as the Court          directs.

  (2)   If a majority representing at least three quarters in value of the shares of members or class of members, or of the interest of creditors or class of          creditors, as the case may be, being present and voting either in person or by         proxy at the meeting, agree to any compromise or arrangement, the     compromise or arrangement may be referred by the Court to the Securities       and Exchange Commission which shall appoint one or more inspectors to        investigate the fairness of the compromise or arrangement and to make a        written report on it to the Court within a time specified by the Court.

  (3)   If the Court is satisfied as to the fairness of the compromise or arrangement,     it shall sanction the same and the compromise or arrangement shall be        binding on all the creditors or the class of creditors or on the members or the        class of members as the case may be, and also the company or in the case of         a company in the course of being wound up, on the liquidator and       contributories of the company.

  (4)   An order made under subsection (3) shall have no effect until a certified true           copy of the order has been delivered by the company to the Commission for           registration and a copy of every order shall be annexed to every copy of the           memorandum of the company issued after the order has been made.

  (5)   If a company defaults in complying with subsection (4), the company and         each officer of the company is liable to a penalty as prescribed by the     Commission in the regulations.

  (6)   In this section and section 716 of this Act, "company" means any company           liable to be wound up under this Act.

 

716.   Information as to compromise with creditors and members.

  (1)   Where a meeting of creditors or any class of creditors or of members or any           class of members is summoned under section 715 of this Act, there shall —

          (a)     with every notice summoning the meeting which is sent to a creditor                           or member, be sent also a statement explaining the effect of the                                   compromise or arrangement and in particular stating any material                     interests of the directors of the company, whether as directors or as                             members or as creditors of the company or otherwise, and the effect                            of the compromise or arrangement in so far as it is different from the                           effect on the like interest of other persons; and

          (b)     in every notice summoning the meeting which is given by                                   advertisement, be included such a statement, or a notification of the                             place at which and the manner in which creditors or members entitled                         to attend the meeting may obtain copies of such a statement. (2)Where              the compromise or arrangement affects the rights of debenture holders                    of the company, the statement shall give the like explanation as                                   respects the trustees of any deed for securing the issue of the                                  debenture as it is required to give as respects the company's directors.

  (3)   Where a notice given by advertisement includes a notification that copies of      a statement explaining the effects of the compromise or arrangement          proposed can be obtained by creditors or members entitled to attend the          meeting, every such creditor or member shall, on making application in the    manner indicated by the notice, be furnished by the company free of charge    with a copy of the statement.

  (4)   Where a company makes default in complying with any requirement of this           section, the company and every officer of the company are liable to a       penalty as prescribed by the Commission in the regulations and for the purpose of this subsection any liquidator of the company and any trustee of a      deed for securing the issue of debentures of the company shall be deemed to    be an officer of the company:

          Provided that a person is not liable under this subsection, if that person shows that the default was due to refusal of any other person, being a       director or trustee for debenture holders, to supply the necessary particulars as to his interests.

  (5)   A director of the company and any trustee for debenture holders of the    company shall give notice to the company of such matters relating to himself          as may be necessary for the purpose of this section, and any person who        defaults in complying with this subsection is liable to a penalty as prescribed          by the Commission in the regulations.

  (1)   No winding up petition or enforcement action by a creditor (secured or           unsecured) shall be entertained against any company or its assets that has           commenced a process of arrangement and compromise with its creditors for     six months from the time that the company by way of affidavit provides the           following documents to the Court:

          (a)     a document setting out the terms intended to be proposed to the                                  creditors in an arrangement or compromise;

   (4)  In the case of current assets distribution, costs may not be included in           production costs.

27.  (1) Subject to the qualification mentioned below the purchase price or

          (a)     any assets which fall to be included under any item shown in a                                    company's balance sheet under the general item "stocks"; and

          (b)     any assets which are tangible assets (including investments), may be                           determined by the application of any of the methods mentioned in                     sub- paragraph (2) below in relation to any such assets of the same                             class, and the method chosen must be one which appears to the                                   directors to be appropriate in the circumstances of the company.

   (2)  Those methods are—

          (a)     the method known as "first in, first out" (FIFO);

          (b)     the method known as "last in, first out" (LIFO);

          (c)      a weighted average price; and

          (d)     any other method similar to any of the methods mentioned above.

   (3)  Where in the case of any company-

          (a)     the purchase price or production cost of assets falling to be included                           under any item shown in the company's balance sheet has been                                   determined by the application of any method permitted by this                                   paragraph, and

          (b)     the amount shown in respect of that item differs materially from the                           relevant alternative amount given below in this paragraph, the                                    difference shall be disclosed in a note to the accounts to the accounts.

   (4)  Subject to subparagraph (5) below, for the purposes of subparagraph (3)          (b), the relevant alternative amount, in relation to any item shown in a company's balance .sheet, is the amount which would have been shown in          respect of that item if assets of any class included under that item at an          amount determined by any method permitted by this paragraph had instead    been included at their replacement cost as at the balance sheet date.

   (5)  The relevant alternative amount may be determined by reference to the most           recent actual purchase price or production cost before the balance sheet date     of the assets of any class included under the item in question instead of by   reference to their replacement cost as at that date, but only if the former           appears to the directors of the company to constitute the more appropriate standard of comparison in the case of assets of that class.

   (6)  For the purposes of this paragraph, assets of any description shall be      regarded as tangible if assets of that description are substantially         indistinguishable one from another.

 

Substitution of original stated amount where price or cost unknown

28.     Where there is no record of the purchase price or production cost of any assets of a company or of any price, expenses or costs relevant for        determining its purchase price or production cost in accordance with        paragraph 26, or any such record cannot be obtained without unreasonable    expense or delay, its purchase price or production cost shall be taken for the        purposes of paragraph 17 - 23 to be the value record of its value made on or after its acquisition or production by the company.

 

SECTION C

ALTERNATIVE ACCOUNTING RULES

 Preliminary

29.  (1) The rules set out in section B are referred to in this Schedule as the

          historical cost accounting rules.

   (2) Those rules, with the omission of paragraphs 16,21 and 25 - 28, are referred    to below in this Part of the Schedule as the depreciation rules, and references        in this Schedule to the historical cost accounting rules do not include the   depreciation rules as they apply by virtue of paragraph 32.

 

30.     Subject to paragraph 32 to 34, the amount to be included in respect of assets    of any description mentioned in paragraph 26 may be determined on any    basis so mentioned.

 

Alternative accounting rules

31.  (1) Intangible fixed assets, other than goodwill, may be included at their

          current cost.

   (2)  Tangible fixed assets may be included at a market value determined as at         the date of their valuation or at their current cost.

   (3)  Investment of any description falling to be included under item B III of   either of the balance sheet formats set out in Part I of this Schedule may be included either—

          (a)     at a market value determined as at the date of their last valuation, or

          (b)     at a value determined on any basis which appears to the directors to be             appropriate in the circumstances of the company, but in the latter case                        particulars of the method of valuation adopted and of the reasons for                          adopting it shall be disclosed in a note to the accounts.

  (4)   Investments of any description falling to be included under item C III of   either of the balance sheet formats set out in Part I of this Schedule may be included at their current cost.
