{a) the goods, works and services are available only from a limited number of suppliers or con-tractors, it shall invite tenders from all the suppliers and contractors who can provide the goods, works or services; and

(c)	owing to a catastrophic event, there is an urgent need for the goods, works or services, mak-ing it impractical to use other methods of procurement because of the time involved in using those methods;

(d)	a procuring entity which has procured goods, equipment, technology or services from a sup-plier or contractor, determines that—

PART IV

Principles and Methods of Consultants Selection

(43)	Scope of Consulting Services.—Procuring Entities may need consulting services for a variety of needs in engineering, architecture, economics and finance, management of projects and procurement, or a combination thereof. Consulting services may be classified into the following categories—

(a)	Advisory or Counselling Services, including staffing, training and institution building and

specific advice on issues and projects.

(b)	Pre-Investment Studies, including identification, pre-feasibility and feasibility studies, in-cluding regional or sectoral planning, policy and investment priorities.

(c)	Engineering and Design Studies, to define the scope and design of a project, such as the preparation of drawings, specifications, detailed cost estimates and complete tender docu-ments for the invitation of bids for construction and/or equipment procurement. In addition, these services may include assistance in the pre-qualification of contractors, analysis of bids and recommendations on the award of contracts, and drawing up final contract provisions with the selected contractor.

{d) Implementation or Supervision Services, to ensure execution of the project in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract, manage expenditure control, and provide certi-fication of materials, quantities and invoices submitted by the contractors and suppliers. Such services may also include introducing modifications in the design or specifications, as necessary, upon prior agreement with the Procuring Entity or the owner of the project.

(e)	Project Management, where the Procuring Entity engages a Project Management Consultant to undertake the overall responsibility for planning, design, procurement, construction and commissioning of a project. The Project Management Consultant acts as the Procuring En-tity’s executing arm in all matters connected with the implementation of a project. There is no uniform pattern according to which services under this category are rendered: sometimes a consultant may be engaged to act as the sole project consultant often with vast powers; or an independent consultant may be appointed under a project manager and be entrusted with the discharge of specific tasks.

(/) In addition, the Procuring Entity may also need specialist services to assist it in the preparation and appraisal of projects, and the supervision and evaluation of on-going projects or to provide advice on technical matters.

Types of Consultants

(44)	Consultants, to who these Regulations apply, may be grouped into one or a combination of the following—

(d)	consulting firms forming part of, or otherwise affiliated to, or associated with, or owned by

contractors or manufacturers; or consulting firms combining the functions of consultants with those of contractors/manufacturers (see paragraphs	on conflicts of in

(45)	If the consulting assignment includes an important component for training or transfer of knowledge, the terms of reference shall indicate the objectives, nature, scope, and goals of the training programme, including details on trainers and trainees, skills to be transferred, time frame, and monitor-ing and evaluation arrangements. The cost for the training programme shall be included in the budget for the assignment and the consultant’s contract.

Criteria for Selection of Consultants

(46)	Subject to such other regulations as may herein be prescribed by the Bureau—

(a) price shall not be the sole criteria for the selection of Bidders for the provision of consulting services;

(b)	The selection of consultants shall be based on the numerically weighted assessment of the

experience, performances, quality of personnel, price and methodology, such as to rank the. Bids from highest to lowest in terms of their calculated ratings. The Bid with the highest cal-culated rating shall be the 'Highest Rated/Evaluated Bid”.

(47)	Procedure for Consultant Selection.—Every Procuring Entity shall proceed to selection of consulting firms by conducting activity in the following order—

(/) selection of the best ranking proposal, followed by negotiations with the selected consultant; and

(k)	awarding the contract to the selected consultant and signing it.

(b)	the relevant background, including available studies, of the project and institutions concerned;

(c)	the type of services required and objectives sought;

(d)	the schedules of implementation and expected outputs (periodic reports, documents and end products);

(0 a description of the main terms and conditions of appointment;

(/) the approximate number of staff-months that may, required;

feasibility study, supervision of implementation after detailed engineering), when continuity is essential. If this possibility is part of the project, the Procuring Entity shall indicate clearly in the RfP the scope and requirements for this follow-up assignment. Short listed consultants shall duly respond to the criteria of this assignment, to arrive at an equitable and transparent selection during proposal evaluation and to enable the Procuring Entity to negotiate a suit-able contract for the follow-up assignment with the selected consultant when the situation arises.

(/) All other important elements considered necessary to enable the consultant to submit a com-prehensive proposal and estimate of the cost.

(49)	TOR for Complex assignments.—TORs for assignments of a complex nature such as might re-quire research and innovation to achieve the aims of the assignment may be issued stipulating the al-lowance for the consultants to propose suitable approaches and methodology to meet the aims of the Procuring Entity.

(b)	cost estimates covering the technical requirements of the TOR to ensure that the financial commitments of the consultants fully reflect their technical proposals, which if inaccurate- could result in deficient proposal evaluation and contract award, and unsatisfactory contract implementation;

(i)	remuneration (fees); and

(ii)	reimbursable cost items (travel and transport, communications, production of reports, office rent, local staff salaries, local taxes, etc.);

(d)	local taxes (indirect and direct) and customs duties on imported equipment and supplies, which shall be identified separately from the base cost.

Selection Methods

(53)	Quality and Cost-Based Selection - QCBS.—The Procuring Entity shall use any of the follow-ing selection methods—

{a) selection based on the technical quality with price consideration. Using this method, quality and price factors are combined and weighted in varying proportions depending on the impor-tance of the quality versus price. The weight given to price in the overall ranking of the

consultants shall depend on the technical complexity of the assignment and the nature of the project. Careful consideration shall be given to evaluations to assure that price considerations do not compromise quality. Generally, the proportional weights shall be set at eighty points for quality and twenty points for price, but could be seventy and thirty points, respectively, for assignments of standard or routine nature, or conversely ninety and ten points respec-tively, for assignments where technical quality is of critical importance. Only the technical proposals which have passed the minimum technical mark set in the RfP will proceed to the financial evaluation. The required methodology shall be explained in the RfP.

The selected most qualified consulting firm is requested to prepare a technical and financial proposal on the basis of detailed TOR. For this procedure, only a simplified RfP is required.

{/)	Sole-Source Selection {or Direct Contracting) - SSS.—Allowed only in exceptional circum

stances, subject to BPP prior certification and generally for small assignments only.

PART V
