[No. 15 of 1997.]

<strong>186.	Powers of the Court of Appeal</strong>

(1)	If it appears to the Court of Appeal that an appellant, though not properly convicted on some charge preferred against him before the court-martial by which he was tried, was properly convicted on some other charge so preferred, then, if the sentence passed by the court-martial on the appellant was not one which could lawfully be passed by the court-martial for the offence of which he was convicted on the other charge, the Court of Appeal shall pass on the appellant, in substitution for the sentence passed on him by the court-martial, such sentence as it thinks proper, being a sentence which, under section 118 or 119 of this Act might lawfully be passed in respect of the charge on which the appellant was properly convicted, but not being a sentence of greater severity.

(2)	Where an appellant has been convicted of an offence and the court-martial by which he was tried could lawfully have found him guilty of some other offence, and it appears to the Court of Appeal that the court-martial shall have been satisfied of facts which proved him guilty of that other offence, the Court of Appeal may, instead of allowing or dismissing the Appeal, substituting for the finding of the court-martial a finding of guilty of the other offence and pass on the appellant, in substitution for the sentence passed on him by the court-martial, such sentence as it thinks proper, being a sentence which, under section 118 or 119 of this Act, could lawfully have been passed for that other offence but not being a sentence of greater severity.

(3)	Where—

(a)	an appellant has been convicted of an offence committed under circumstances involving the higher of two degrees of punishment, and it appears to the Court of Appeal that the court- martial by which he was tried ought to have found him guilty of the offences as being committed under circumstances involving the lower degree of punishment; or

(b)	an appellant has been convicted of an offence and it appears to the Court of Appeal that the court-martial by which he was tried ought to have found him guilty of the offence subject to exceptions or variations,

the Court of Appeal may, instead of allowing or dismissing the appeal, substitute for the finding of the court-martial a finding of guilty of the offence as being committed under circumstances involving the lower degree of punishment or, as the case may be, is guilty of the offence subject to exceptions or variations and pass on the appellant, in substitution for the sentence passed on him by the court-martial, such sentence as it thinks proper, being a sentence which, under section 118 or 119 of this Act, could lawfully have been passed for the offence specified or involved in the substituted finding, but not being a sentence of greater severity.

(4)	If, on an appeal, it appears to the Court of Appeal that, although the appellant committed the act or omission charged against him, he was insane at the time the act was done, or the omission made, so as not to be responsible according to law for his actions, the Court of Appeal may quash the sentence passed at the trial and order the appellant to be kept in custody under the provisions of section 156 of this Act, in like manner as on a special finding of insanity by the court-martial by which the appellant was convicted.

(5)	The term of any sentence passed by the Court of Appeal under any of the foregoing provisions of this section shall, unless the Court of Appeal otherwise directs, begin to run from the time from which it would have begun to run if it had been passed in the proceedings from which the appeal is brought and such sentence shall be deemed for the purposes of this Act to be a sentence passed by the court-martial being a sentence that has been confirmed.
