(f)	on voluntary withdrawal after putting in not less than ten years but less than fifteen years

<strong>SECOND SCHEDULE</strong>

[Section 9.]

Pensions and Gratuities for Disablement

Awards: General

1.	(1) The authorities of the services concerned shall refer to the medical board all servicemen who in their opinion may be eligible for an award under this Act.

(2) Each such reference shall be accompanied by all documents material to the consideration of the particular case, and the medical board may call for such further information as it requires.

2.	The disablement of a serviceman shall be accepted as being due to war service for the purpose of this Act if the relevant service authority is satisfied that the disablement is due to a wound, injury or disease which—

(a)	is attributable to war service; or

(b)	existed before or arose during war service and has been or remains aggravated thereby.

3.	Where an injury or disease which has led to the retirement or discharge of a serviceman during war service was not noted in the medical report made on the serviceman on the commencement of his service, the injury or disease shall be accepted as due to war service unless the evidence shows that the conditions set out in paragraph 2 of this Schedule are not fulfilled.

4.	Where there is no note in contemporary official records of a material fact on which a claim for an award under this Act is based, other reliable corroborative evidence of that fact may be accepted.

5.	Any person aggrieved by a decision of the medical board may appeal to the Minister, whose decision in the matter shall be final.

<strong>Disablement Awards</strong>

6.	An award under this Act in respect of the disablement of a serviceman shall, unless his condition permits a final settlement of the degree of the disablement, be made on a temporary basis until a final settlement of the degree of his disablement can be made.

7.	The category of disablement and the corresponding disability pension shall be in accordance with Table A of this Schedule.

8.	The degree of disablement shall be assessed by making a comparison between the condition of the disabled serviceman and the conditions of a normal healthy person of the same age, without taking into account—

(a)	the earning capacity of the serviceman in his disabled condition in his own or any other specific trade or occupation; or

(b)	the effect of any individual factors or extraneous circumstances.

9.	Notwithstanding paragraph 8 of this Schedule—

(a)	where a disablement has reached a settled condition and either is due to an injury specified in Table B of this Schedule or is itself a disablement it shall, in the absence of any special features, be certified for the purposes of this Act by reference to the percentage specified in the said Table B as appropriate to that injury or that disablement;

(b)	where a disablement is due to more than one wound, injury or disease, a composite assess-ment of the degree of disablement shall be made by reference to the combined effect of all such causes of die disablement.

10.	The medical board shall assess the degree of disablement having due regard to the provisions of paragraphs 8 and 9 of this Schedule, and for this purpose may cause the applicant to be further medically examined.

11.	In cases where the nature of the disablement makes surgical or medical appliances necessary, such surgical or medical appliances shall be supplied free of cost to the serviceman concerned.
