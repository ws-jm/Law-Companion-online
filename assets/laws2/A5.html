(b) any other ship of which, at the time when the action is brought, the relevant person is the beneficial owner in respect of all the shares in the ship.

(5) In the case of a claim in the nature of towage in respect of an aircraft, an action in rem may be brought in the court against that aircraft if, at the time when the action is brought, it is beneficially owned by the person who would be liable on the claim in an action in personam.

(6) Where, in the exercise of its admiralty jurisdiction, the court orders any ship, aircraft or other property to be sold, the court shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine any question arising as to the title to the proceeds of sale.

(7) In determining, for the purposes of subsections (4) and (5) of this section, whether a person would be liable on a claim in an action in personam, it shall be assumed that the person has his habitual residence or place of business within Nigeria.

(8) Where a ship has been served with a writ or arrested in an action in rem brought to enforce a claim, no other ship shall (subject to subsection (9) of this section) be served with a writ or arrested in that or any other action in rem brought to enforce that claim; but this subsection shall not prevent the issue, in respect of any one such claim, of a writ naming more than one ship (for example where the claim relates to repairs to two or more ships in the same ownership) or of two or more writs each naming a different ship.

<strong>6. Re-arrest</strong>

(1) A ship or other property arrested in a proceeding on a maritime claim shall not be re-arrested in the proceeding in relation to the claim unless the court so orders, because default has been made in the performance of a guarantee undertaking given to procure the release of the ship or property from the earlier arrest or for some other sufficient reason.

<strong>9. Limitation of liability proceedings</strong>

(1) A person who apprehends that a claim for compensation under any law, including the Merchant Shipping Act, that gives effect to a Liability Convention may be made against him by some other person, may apply to the court to determine the question whether the liability of the first-mentioned person in respect of the claim may be limited under that law.

[Cap. Mil.]

(b) where a ship or other property is under arrest in the proceeding,

the court may, order that the proceeding be stayed on condition that the arrest and detention of the ship or property shall stay or satisfactory security for their release be given as security for the satisfaction of any award or judgment that may be made in the arbitration or in a proceeding in the court of the foreign country.
