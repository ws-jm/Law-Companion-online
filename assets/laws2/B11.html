(i)	Training

4.	Purpose and method

(1)	The objects of borstal training shall be to bring to bear every good influence, which may estab-lish in the inmates the will to lead a good and useful life on release, and to fit them to do so by the fullest possible development of their character, capacities and sense of personal responsibility.

(2)	Methods of training may vary as between one borstal and another, according to the needs of the different types of inmates allocated to them.

5.	Removal to a borstal

A person sentenced to borstal training shall be removed at the earliest possible date to a borstal.

(2)	An officer shall be responsible to the Superintendent, with the assistance of such other staff as may be appointed for the administration of each house and for the personal training of the inmates in his house.

7.	Grading

(1)	To encourage the progressive development of responsibility and to assist in the assessment for fitness for release, inmates may be placed in such grades as the Director approves.

(2)	Promotion from grade to grade or reduction in grade, otherwise than as an award for an offence against discipline shall be decided by the Superintendent with the advice of such officers as the Director shall determine.

(3)	Inmates who have been promoted to an appropriate grade may be given positions of special re-sponsibility and leadership.

8.	Privileges

(1)	There shall be established at every borstal such system of privileges as the Director may approve in the interests of good conduct and training.

(2)	Such system shall include arrangements under which sums paid to inmates under these Regula-tions may be spent on such articles and subject to such conditions as the Director shall determine.

(ii)	Reception and removal

9.	Admission to a borstal and transfer to other borstals

(1)	No person may be admitted into a borstal unless accompanied by a warrant committing him to a sentence of borstal training; and the Superintendent shall verify that the inmate is the person named in the warrant, that the offence and the date of sentence are recorded therein and that the warrant bears the signature of the proper authority. 

(2)	A warrant of committal to borstal training shall be addressed by the court of committal to the Superintendent of the borstal which is situated nearest to the court, and thereafter the inmate may be removed on the instructions of the Director to any borstal for the purposes of training, discipline, health, the relief of overcrowding or any other proper reason.

10.	Search

(1)	Every inmate shall be searched when taken into custody by an officer, on reception at a borstal, and at such subsequent times as may be directed, and all unauthorised articles shall be taken from him.

(2)	The searching of an inmate shall be conducted in as seemly a manner as is consistent with the necessity of discovering any concealed article.

(3)	No inmate shall be stripped and searched in the sight of another inmate.

(4)	An inmate shall be searched only by officers of the same sex as the inmate.

(1)	An inmate, in respect of whom an order for removal to any place outside the borstal is produced, shall, while outside the borstal, be kept in custody of either borstal or prison officers:

Provided that an inmate directed to be brought before a court of summary jurisdiction may while outside the borstal be in the custody of police officers:

Provided also that an inmate removed to a hospital under sub-regulation (2) of this Regulation may, at the discretion of the Superintendent, be in the custody of the medical officer of the hospital during the time that such inmate is detained therein.

(2)	An inmate who is seriously ill and for whom there is no suitable accommodation in the borstal may be removed upon the certificate of a medical officer to a Government or other approved hospital and remain therein until a medical officer certifies that he is fit to be returned to the borstal and the Superintendent shall cause the return of the inmate to the borstal provided that he is still liable to be detained therein.

17.	Medical examination prior to removal to another borstal

(iii)	Discipline and control

19.	General principles

The purpose of borstal training requires that every inmate, while conforming to the rules necessary for well-ordered community life, shall be able to develop his individuality on right lines with a proper sense of personal responsibility. Officers shall therefore, while firmly maintaining discipline and order, seek to do so by influencing the inmates through their own example and leadership and by enlisting their willing co-operation.

20.	Removal from house
