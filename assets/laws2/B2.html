CHAPTER B2

BANKRUPTCY ACT

An Act to make provisions for declaring as bankrupt any person who can not pay his debts of a specified amount and to disqualify him from holding certain elective, and other public offices or from practising any regulated profession (except as an employee).

[No. 16 of 1979.]

[Date of commencement: 20th April, 1979]

PART I

Proceedings from Act ofBankruptcy to Discharge

Acts of Bankruptcy

1.	Acts of bankruptcy

A debtor commits an act of bankruptcy in each of the following cases—

[No. 109 of 1992.]

(a)	if a creditor—

(i)	has obtained a final judgment or final order against him for any amount, and execution thereon not having been stayed, has a bankruptcy notice served on him; and

(ii)	does not, within fourteen days after service of the notice, comply with the requirements of the notice or satisfy the court that he has a counterclaim, set-off or crossdemand which equals or exceeds the amount of the judgment debt or sum ordered to be paid, and which he could not set up in the action in which the judgment was obtained or the proceedings in which the order was obtained,

and for the purposes of this paragraph and of section 4, any person who is for the time being entitled to enforce a final judgment or final order shall be deemed to be a creditor who has obtained a final judgment or final order; or

(b)	if execution against him has been levied by seizure of his goods under process in an action, or proceedings in the court, and the goods have either been sold or held by the bailiff for twenty-one days:

Provided that, where an inter-pleader summons has been taken out in regard to the goods seized, the time elapsing between the date at which such summons is taken out and the date at which the proceedings on such summons are finally disposed of, settled or abandoned, shall not be taken into account in calculating such period of twenty-one days; or

(c)	if he files in the court a declaration of his inability to pay his debts or presents a bankruptcy petition against himself; 

(d)	if he suspends or gives notice that he is about to suspend payment of his debts to any of his creditors;

(e)	if under a credit agreement the creditor becomes entitled to file a bankruptcy petition;

(f)	if, in Nigeria or elsewhere, he makes a conveyance or assignment of his property to a trustee

or trustees for the benefit of his creditors generally;

(g)	if, in Nigeria or elsewhere, he makes a fraudulent conveyance, gift, delivery or transfer of his property or any part thereof, with an intent to defeat or delay the claim of his creditors;

(h)	if, in Nigeria or elsewhere, he makes any conveyance or transfer of his property or any part thereof, or created any charge thereon, which would under this or any other Act be void as a fraudulent preference if he were adjudged bankrupt; or

(i) 	if, with intent to defeat or delay the claims of his creditors, he departs out of Nigeria, or being out of Nigeria remains out of Nigeria, or departs from his dwelling, or otherwise absents himself, or begins to keep house.

2.	Bankruptcy notices

A bankruptcy notice under this Act shall be issued to a judgment creditor, or a creditor who has ob-tained a final order, by the Registrar on the filing of a request for that purpose, and shall be in such form as may be prescribed by the general rules, and shall require the debtor to pay the judgment debt or sum ordered to be paid in accordance with the terms of the judgment or order, or to secure or compound for it to the satisfaction of the creditor or the court, and shall state the consequences of non-compliance with the notice, and shall be served in the prescribed manner:

Provided that a bankruptcy notice—

(a)	may specify an agent to act on behalf of the creditor in respect of any payment or other thing required by the notice to be made to, or done to the satisfaction of, the creditor;

(b)	shall not be invalidated by reason only that the sum specified in the notice as the amount due exceeds the amount actually due, unless the debtor within the time allowed for payment gives notice to the creditor that he disputes the validity of the notice on the ground of such mis-statement, but if the debtor does not give such notice, he shall be deemed to have complied with the bankruptcy notice if within the time allowed he takes such steps as would have constituted a compliance with the notice had the actual amount due been correctly specified therein.

3.	Jurisdiction to make receiving order

Subject to the conditions hereinafter specified, if a debtor commits an act of bankruptcy, the court may, on a bankruptcy petition being presented either by a creditor or by the debtor, make an order, in this Act called a receiving order, for the protection of the estate.

4.	Conditions on which creditor may petition

(1)	Subject to the provisions of section 7 of this Act, a creditor shall not be entitled to present a bankruptcy petition against a debtor unless—

[No. 109 of 1992.]

(a)	the debt owing by the debtor to the petitioning creditor, or if two or more creditors join in the petition, the aggregate amount of debts owing to the several petitioning creditors, is not less than N2,000;

(b)	the debt is a liquidated sum, payable either immediately or at some certain future time;

(c)	the act of bankruptcy on which the petition is grounded has occurred within three months before the presentation of the petition; and

(d)	the debtor is ordinarily resident in Nigeria, or within a year before the date of the presentation of the petition, has ordinarily resided or had a dwelling-house or place of business in Nigeria, or has carried on business in Nigeria, personally or by means of an agent or manager, or is or within the said period has been a member of a firm or partnership of persons which has carried on business in Nigeria by means of a partner or partners or an agent or manager.

(2)	If the petitioning creditor is a secured creditor he shall in his petition either state that he is willing to give up his security for the benefit of the creditors in the event of the debtor being adjudged bankrupt, or give an estimate of the value of his security; in the latter case he may be admitted as a petitioning creditor to the extent of the balance of the debt due to him after deducting the value so estimated in the same manner as if he were an unsecured creditor.

(3)	Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law or enactment and without prejudice to any other rights of the debtor, a creditor who is entitled to present a bankruptcy petition on or before the end of December, 1992 shall not be disentitled from presenting a petition by virtue only of the provisions of section 4 (1) (c) of this Act if the petition is presented before the expiration of a period of six months.

5.	Liability of firm to have receiving order made against it

The following provisions shall have effect in the case of a firm carrying on business in Nigeria—

(a)	a creditor of the firm shall be entitled to present a bankruptcy petition against the firm, and a receiving order may be made against the firm in respect of an act of bankruptcy committed in reference to the business of the firm by any partner of the firm or by any person having control or management of the business of the firm. An act of bankruptcy shall be deemed to be committed in reference to the business of the firm in all cases in which the act relates to the property or creditors of the firm and would be an act of bankruptcy by such partner or person as aforesaid if it related to his property or creditors;

(b)	it shall be sufficient that a receiving order against the firm be made in the firm’s name, without mentioning the names of the partners, and such receiving order shall affect the joint and separate property of all the partners;

(c)	the right of a creditor to present a bankruptcy petition against the firm, and the jurisdiction of the court to make a receiving order or an adjudication of bankruptcy against the firm, shall not be affected by the fact, if it is so, that all or any of the partners of the firm are not citizens of Nigeria or are not resident in Nigeria.

6.	Powers of Official Receiver and duties of debtor on petition being filed

(1)	Immediately on the filing of any petition, the Official Receiver may in cases where he has reason to believe that any offence under this Act or any fraud has been or is about to be perpetrated, by notice delivered to the debtor in person or by ordinary post, summon the debtor to attend before him to give such information as he requires, and may, either by himself or his agent authorised by him in writing, enter on any premises occupied by the debtor between the hours of 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. for the purpose of inspecting his property, stock-in-trade and books of account.

(2)	It shall be the duty of the debtor to furnish the Official Receiver with all such information as it is in the debtor’s power to give or to obtain.

(3)	If the debtor—

(a)	fails without reasonable cause to attend to the Official Receiver as aforesaid or to furnish him with such information as aforesaid;

(b)	obstructs the search of the premises or the production of any book or document required in connection therewith; or

(c)	authorises or permits any obstruction,

the debtor shall be liable on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months.

(4)	Every person who takes any part in any obstruction mentioned in subsection (3) (b) and (c) of this section, whether authorised or permitted by the debtor or not, shall be liable to the like penalty.

7.	Creditor’s petition and order thereon

(1)	A creditor’s petition shall—

(a)	be verified by affidavit of the creditor or of some person on his behalf, having knowledge of the facts; and

(b)	be served in the same manner as a writ of summons, unless some other manner of service be prescribed.

(2)	At the hearing, the court shall require proof of—

(a)	the debt of the petitioning creditor;

(b)	the service of the petition; and

(c)	the act of bankruptcy, or if more than one act of bankruptcy is alleged, acts of bankruptcy, and if satisfied with the proof, may make a receiving order in pursuance of the petition.

(3)	If the court is not satisfied with the proof of the petitioning creditor’s debt or of the act of bank-ruptcy or of the service of the petition, or is satisfied by the debtor that he is able to pay his debts, or is not satisfied that the assets for division among the unsecured creditors, after payment of all costs, charges and expenses, and the debts which are preferential under this Act shall be sufficient to pay a dividend of fifteen per cent, or considers that for other sufficient cause no order ought to be made, the court may dismiss the petition.

(4)	When the act of bankruptcy relied on is non-compliance with a bankruptcy notice to pay, secure or compound for a judgment debt or sum ordered to be paid, the court may, if it thinks fit, stay or dismiss the petition on the ground that an appeal is pending from the judgment or order.

(5)	Where the debtor appears on the petition and denies that he is indebted to the petitioner, or that he is indebted to such an amount as would justify the petitioner in presenting a petition against him, the court, on such security (if any) being given as the court may require for payment to the petitioner of any debt which may be established against him in due course of law, and of the costs of establishing the debt, may, instead of dismissing the petition, stay all proceedings on the petition for such time as may be required for trial of the question relating to the debt.

(6)	Where proceedings are stayed, the court may, if by reason of the delay caused by the stay of proceedings or for any other cause it thinks just, make a receiving order on the petition of some other creditor, and shall thereupon dismiss, on such terms as it thinks just, the petition in which proceedings have been stayed as aforesaid.

(7)	A creditor’s petition shall not after presentment be withdrawn without the leave of the court.

8.	Debtor’s petition and order thereon

(1)	A debtor’s petition shall allege that the debtor is unable to pay his debts, and the presentation thereof shall be deemed an act of bankruptcy without the previous filing by the debtor of any declaration of inability to pay his debts, and the court shall thereupon make a receiving order:

Provided that, it shall be lawful for the court in its discretion to refuse the order if it is not satisfied that the assets for division among the unsecured creditors after payment of all costs, charges and expenses, and the debts which are preferential under this Act, will be sufficient to pay a dividend of fifteen per cent, or if the court considers for other sufficient cause that no order ought to be made. 

(2)	In subsection (1) of this section 'sufficient cause' includes the non-attendance of the debtor, or in the case of a firm, of at least one of the partners thereof, on the hearing of the petition, the absence of any material book of account, or any fraud or misconduct not amounting to fraud by the debtor in relation to his affairs, or in the case of a firm or person carrying on business under a foreign firm name, the non-production of the partnership book or of the receipt used in connection with the business.

(3)	A debtor’s petition shall not after presentiment be withdrawn without the leave of the court.

9.	Appearance of Official Receiver on petition

On the hearing of any creditor’s or debtor’s petition, it shall be lawful for the Official Receiver to appear and to call, examine and cross-examine any witness and, if he so thinks fit, to support or oppose the making of a receiving order.

10.	Effect of receiving order

(1)	On the making of a receiving order, the Official Receiver shall be thereby constituted receiver of the property of the debtor, and thereafter, except as directed by this Act, no creditor to whom the debtor is indebted in respect of any debt provable in bankruptcy, shall have any remedy against the property or person of the debtor in respect of the debt, or shall commence any action or other legal proceedings, unless with the leave of the court and on such terms as the court may impose.

(2)	This section shall not affect the power of any secured creditor to realise or otherwise deal with his security.

11.	Power to appoint interim receiver

The court may, if it is shown to be necessary for the protection of the estate, at any time after the presentation of a bankruptcy petition and before a receiving order is made, appoint the Official Receiver to be interim receiver of the property of the debtor or of any part thereof, and direct him to take immediate possession thereof or of any part thereof.

12.	Power to stay pending proceedings

(1)	The court may at any time after the presentation of a bankruptcy petition either stay any action, execution or other legal process against the property or person of the debtor or allow it to continue on such terms as it may think just.

(2)	Where the court makes an order staying any action or proceeding, or staying proceedings gener-ally, the order may be served by sending a copy thereof, under the seal of the court, by post to the ad-dress for service of the plaintiff and any other party to the proceedings or to the address of the legal practitioner of such party.

(3)	Without prejudice to the provisions of subsection (1) of this section, if the court orders the re-lease of any debtor who is under execution for a civil debt, it may impose such conditions as it thinks fit, and in particular it may require as a condition of such release that the debtor finds security to attend in the subsequent bankruptcy proceedings and to abide by all orders of the court relating to the said proceedings.

13.	Power to appoint special manager

(1)	The court may, on the application of the Official Receiver or of any creditor or creditors, and if satisfied that the nature of the debtor’s estate or business or the interests of the creditors generally re-quire the appointment of a special manager of the estate or business other than the Official Receiver, appoint a manager thereof accordingly to act until a trustee is appointed, and with such powers (including any of the powers of a receiver) as may be entrusted to him by the Official Receiver.

(2)	The special manager shall give security and account in such manner as the court may direct.

(3)	The special manager shall receive such remuneration as may be prescribed.

14.	Advertisement of receiving order

(2)	The Chief Judge of the court may, with the approval of the President, make rules providing for the summoning of and proceedings at the first and other meetings of creditors.

16.	Debtor’s statement of affairs

(1)	Where a receiving order is made against a debtor, he shall make out and submit to the Official Receiver a statement of and in relation to his affairs in the prescribed form verified by affidavit—

(2)	The statement shall be submitted within the following times, namely—

(a)	if the order is made on the petition of the debtor, within seven days from the date of the order;

(b)	if the order is made on the petition of a creditor, within fourteen days from the date of the order,

but the court may in either case for special reasons extend the time.

(3)	If the debtor fails without reasonable excuse to comply with the requirements of this section, he may be punished for contempt of court and the court may, on the application of the Official Receiver or of any creditor, adjudge him bankrupt.

(4)	Any person stating himself to be a creditor of the bankrupt may, on payment of the prescribed fee, personally or by agent inspect the statement at all reasonable times and take any copy thereof or extract therefrom, but any person untruthfully so stating himself to be a creditor shall be guilty of con-tempt of court and shall be punishable accordingly on the application of the trustee or Official Receiver.

Public Examination of Debtor

17.	Public examination of debtor

(1)	Where the court makes a receiving order, it shall, save as in this Act provided, hold a public sit-ting, on a day to be appointed by the court, for the examination of the debtor, and the debtor shall attend thereat and shall be examined as to his conduct, dealings and property.

(2)	The examination shall be held as soon as conveniently may be after the expiration of the time for the submission of the debtor’s statement of affairs.

(3)	The court may adjourn the examination from time to time.

(4)	Any creditor who has tendered a proof, or his representative authorised in writing, may question the debtor concerning his affairs and the causes of his failure.

(5)	The Official Receiver shall take part in the examination of the debtor, and for the avoidance of doubt, no legal practitioner shall be allowed to take part in the examination of the debtor or appear on his behalf at such examination.

(6)	If a trustee is appointed before the conclusion of the examination he may take part therein.

(7)	The court may put such questions to the debtor as it may think expedient.

(8)	The debtor shall be examined upon oath and it shall be his duty to answer all such questions as the court may put or allow to be put to him.

(9)	Such notes of the examination as the court thinks proper shall be taken down either in shorthand or longhand and they or a transcript thereof shall be read over either to or by the debtor and signed by him and may thereafter, save as in this Act provided, be used in evidence against him; they shall also be open to the inspection of any creditor at all reasonable times upon payment of the prescribed fee.

(10)	When the court is of opinion that the affairs of the debtor have been sufficiently investigated, it shall by order declare that his examination is concluded, but such order shall not be made until after the day appointed for the first meeting of creditors.

(11)	Where the debtor suffers from any mental or physical disability as in the opinion of the court makes him unfit to attend his public examination, or is absent from Nigeria, the court may make an order dispensing with such examination or direction that the debtor be examined on such terms, in such manner and at such place as to the court seems expedient.

Compositions and Schemes of Arrangement

18.	Compositions and schemes of arrangement

(1)	Where a debtor intends to make a proposal for a composition in satisfaction of his debts or a proposal for a scheme of arrangement of his affairs, he shall, within seven days of submitting his state-ment of affairs or within such time thereafter as the Official Receiver may fix, lodge with the Official Receiver a proposal in writing, signed by him, embodying the terms of the composition or scheme which he is desirous of submitting for the consideration of his creditors and setting out particulars of any sureties or securities proposed.

(2)	In such case, the Official Receiver shall hold a meeting of creditors before the public examination of the debtor is concluded, and send to each creditor before the meeting a copy of the debtor’s proposal with a report thereon; and if at the meeting a majority in number and not less than two-thirds in value of all the creditors who have proved resolve to accept the proposal, it shall be deemed to be duly accepted by the creditors, and when approved by the court shall be binding on all the creditors.

(3)	The debtor may at the meeting amend the terms of his proposal, if the amendment is in the opinion of the Official Receiver calculated to benefit the general body of creditors.

(4)	Any creditor who has proved his debt may assent to or dissent from the proposal by a letter ad-dressed to the Official Receiver so as to be received by him not later than three days preceding the meeting, and any such assent or dissent shall have effect as if the creditor had been present and had voted at the meeting.

(5)	The debtor or the Official Receiver may, after the proposal is accepted by the creditors, apply to the court to approve it, and notice of the time appointed for hearing the application shall be given to each creditor who has proved.

(6)	The application shall not be heard until after the conclusion of the public examination of the debtor and any creditor who has proved his case may be heard by the court in opposition to the applica-tion, notwithstanding that he may, at a meeting of creditors, have voted for the acceptance of the proposal.

(7)	For the purpose of approving a composition or scheme by joint debtors, the court may, if it thinks fit and on the report of the Official Receiver that it is expedient to do so, dispense with the public examination of any of the joint debtors if they are or any one of them is prevented from attending the examination by illness or other sufficient cause or absence from Nigeria but one at least of such joint debtors shall be publicly examined.

(8)	The court shall before approving the proposal, hear a report of the Official Receiver as to the terms thereof and as to the conduct of the debtor, and any objections which may be made by or on behalf of any creditor.

(9)	If the court is of opinion that the terms of the proposal are not reasonable or are not calculated to benefit the general body of creditors, the court shall refuse to approve the proposal.

(10)	If any facts are proved on proof of which the court would be required either to refuse, suspend or attach conditions to the debtor’s discharge where he is adjudged bankrupt, the court shall refuse to approve the proposal, unless it provides reasonable security for the payment of not less then twenty-five per cent on all the unsecured debts provable against the debtor’s estate.

(11)	In any other case, the court may either approve or refuse to approve the proposal.

(12)	If the court approves the proposal, the approval may be testified by the seal of the court being attached to the instrument containing the terms of the proposed composition or scheme, or by the terms being embodied in an order of the court.

(13)	A composition or scheme accepted and approved in pursuance of this section shall be binding on all the creditors, so far as it relates to any debts due to them from the debtor and provable in bankruptcy.

(14)	A certificate of the Official Receiver that a composition or scheme has been duly accepted and approved shall, in the absence of fraud, be conclusive as to its validity.

(15)	The provisions of a composition or scheme under this section may be enforced by the court on application by any person interested, and any disobedience of an order of the court made on the applica-tion shall be deemed a contempt of court.

(16)	If default is made in payment of any instalment due in pursuance of the composition or scheme, or if it appears to the court on satisfactory evidence that the composition or scheme cannot, in consequence of legal difficulties or for any sufficient cause, proceed without injustice or undue delay to the creditors or to the debtor, or that the approval of the court was obtained by fraud, the court may, if it thinks fit, on application by the Official Receiver or the trustee or by any creditor, adjudge the debtor bankrupt and annul the composition or scheme, but without prejudice to the validity of any sale, dispo-sition or payment duly made or thing duly done under or in pursuance of the composition or scheme.

(17)	Where a debtor is adjudged bankrupt under subsection (16) of this section, any debt provable in other respects, which has been contracted before the adjudication, shall be provable in the bankruptcy. 

(18)	If under or in pursuance of a composition or scheme a trustee is appointed to administer the debtor’s property or manage his business or to distribute the composition, section 27 and Part IV of this Act shall apply as if the trustee were a trustee in bankruptcy and as if the terms 'bankruptcy”, 'bankrupt' and 'order of adjudication' included respectively a composition or scheme of arrangement, a compounding or arranging debtor and an order approving the composition or scheme.

(19)	Part II of this Act shall, so far as the nature of the case and the terms of the composition or scheme admit, apply thereto, the same interpretation being given to the words 'trustee”, 'bankruptcy”, 'bankrupt' and 'order of adjudication' as in subsection (18) of this section.

(20)	No composition or scheme shall be approved by the court which does not provide for the pay-ment in priority to other debts of all debts directed to be so paid in the distribution of the property of a bankrupt.

(21)	The acceptance by a creditor of a composition or scheme shall not release any person who under this Act would not be released by an order of discharge if the debtor had been adjudged bankrupt.

19.	Effect of composition or scheme

Notwithstanding the acceptance and approval of a composition or scheme, the composition or scheme shall not be binding on any creditor so far as regards a debt or liability from which under the provisions of this Act the debtor would not be released by an order of discharge in bankruptcy, unless the creditor assents to the composition or scheme.

Adjudication of Bankruptcy

20.	Adjudication of bankruptcy where composition not accepted or not approved

(1)	Where a receiving order is made against a debtor then, if the creditors at the first meeting or any adjournment thereof by ordinary resolution resolve that the debtor be adjudged bankrupt, or pass no resolution, or if the creditors do not meet or if a composition or scheme is not approved in pursuance of this Act within fourteen days after the conclusion of the examination of the debtor or such further time as the court may allow, the court shall adjudge the debtor bankrupt, and thereupon the property of the bankrupt shall become divisable among his creditors and shall vest in a trustee.

(2)	Notice of every order adjudging a debtor bankrupt, stating the name, address and description of the bankrupt, the date of the adjudication and the name of the trustee, shall be published in the Federal Gazette and shall be advertised in at least two newspapers, or as may be prescribed, and the date of the order shall, for the purposes of this Act, be the date of the adjudication.

21.	Appointment of trustee

(1)	Where a debtor is adjudged bankrupt or the creditors have resolved that he be adjudged bank-rupt, the creditors may by ordinary resolution appoint the Official Receiver or some other fit person, whether a creditor or not, to fill the office of trustee of the property of the bankrupt or they may resolve to leave his appointment to the committee of inspection hereinafter mentioned, so however that a person shall be deemed not fit to act as trustee of the property of a bankrupt where he has been previously removed from the office of trustee of a bankrupt’s property for misconduct or neglect of duty.

(2)	The person appointed shall, unless he is the Official Receiver, give such security as the court may direct or as may be prescribed, and the court, if satisfied with the security, shall certify under the hand of the Registrar that his appointment has been duly made, unless the appointment is disapproved by the court on the ground that it has not been made in good faith by a majority in value of the creditors voting, or that the person appointed is not fit to act as trustee, or that his connection with or relation to the bankrupt or his estate or any particular creditors makes it difficult for him to act with impartiality in the interests of the creditors generally.

(3)	The appointment of a trustee shall take effect as from the date of the certificate.

(4)	When a debtor is adjudged bankrupt after the first meeting of creditors has been held and a trus-tee has not been appointed prior to the adjudication, the Official Receiver shall forthwith summon a meeting of creditors for the purpose of appointing a trustee, and if no trustee is then appointed by the creditors, the court shall on the application of the Official Receiver appoint the Official Receiver or some other fit person to be trustee.

22.	Committee of Inspection

(1)	The creditors qualified to vote may, at their first or any subsequent meeting, by resolution, ap-point a Committee of Inspection for the purpose of superintending the administration of the bankrupt’s property by the trustee.

(a)	that of being a creditor or the holder of a general proxy or general power of attorney from a

creditor, provided that, no creditor and no holder of a general proxy or general power of at-torney for a creditor shall be qualified to act as a member of the Committee of Inspection until the creditor has proved his debt and the proof has been admitted; or

(b)	that of being a person to whom a creditor intends to give a general proxy or general power of attorney, provided that, no such person shall be qualified to act as a member of the Committee of Inspection until he holds such a proxy or power of attorney, and until the creditor has proved his debt and the proof has been admitted.

(3)	The Committee of Inspection shall meet at such times as it shall from time to time appoint and failing such appointment, at least once a month, and the trustee or any member of the Committee may also call a meeting of the Committee as and when he thinks necessary.

(4)	The Committee may act by a majority of its members present at a meeting, but shall not act unless a majority of the Committee is present at the meeting.

(5)	Any member of the Committee may resign his office by notice in writing signed by him and de-livered to the trustee.

(6)	If a member of the Committee becomes bankrupt, or compounds or arranges with his creditors, or is absent from five consecutive meetings of the Committee, his office shall thereupon become vacant.

(7)	Any member of the Committee may be removed by an ordinary resolution at any meeting of creditors of which seven days’ notice has been given stating the object of the meeting.

(8)	On a vacancy occurring in the office of a member of the Committee, the trustee shall forthwith summon a meeting of creditors for the purpose of filling the vacancy, and the meeting may, by resolution, appoint another creditor or other person eligible as above to fill the vacancy.

(9)	The continuing members of the Committee, provided there be not less than three such continuing members, may act notwithstanding any vacancy therein and, where the number of members of the Committee of Inspection is for the time being less than five, the creditors may increase that number so that it does not exceed five.

23.	Power to accept composition or scheme after adjudication

(1)	Where a debtor is adjudged bankrupt the creditors may, if they think fit, at any time after the ad-judication, by a majority in number and not less than two-thirds in value of all the creditors who have proved, resolve to accept a proposal for a composition in satisfaction of the debts due to them under the bankruptcy or for a scheme of arrangement of the bankrupt’s affairs, and thereupon the same proceedings shall be taken and the same consequences shall ensue as in the case of a composition or scheme accepted before adjudication.

(2)	If the court approves the composition or scheme it may make an order annulling the bankruptcy and vesting the property of the bankrupt in him or in such other person as the court may appoint on such terms and subject to such conditions, if any, as the court may declare.

(3)	If default is made in payment of any instalment due in pursuance of the composition or scheme, or if it appears to the court that the composition or scheme cannot proceed without injustice or undue delay, or that the approval of the court was obtained by fraud, the court may, if it thinks fit, on application by any person interested, adjudge the debtor bankrupt and annul the composition or scheme, but without prejudice to the validity of any sale, disposition or payment duly made or thing duly done under or in pursuance of the composition or scheme.

(4)	Where a debtor is adjudged bankrupt under subsection (3) of this section, all debts, provable in other respects, which have been contracted before the date of such adjudication shall be provable in the bankruptcy.

25.	Arrest of debtor under certain circumstances

(1)	The court may, by warrant addressed to any person or persons named therein, cause a debtor to be arrested, and any books, papers, money and goods in his possession or under his control or relating to his affairs to be seized, and him and them to be safely kept as prescribed until such time as the court may order under the following circumstances—

(а)	if, after a bankruptcy notice has been issued under this Act or after presentation of a bank-ruptcy petition by or against him, it appears to the court that there is probable cause for be-lieving that he has absconded, or is about to abscond, with a view of avoiding payment of the debt in respect of which the bankruptcy petition, or of avoiding appearance to any such peti-tion, or of avoiding examination in respect of his affairs, or of otherwise avoiding, delaying or embarrassing proceedings in bankruptcy against him;

(b)	if, after presentation of a bankruptcy petition by or against him, it appears to the court that there is probable cause for believing that he is about to dispose of or remove his goods with a view to preventing or delaying possession being taken of them by the Official Receiver or trustee, or that there is probable ground for believing that he has concealed or is about to conceal or destroy any of his goods or any books, documents or writings which might be of use to his creditors in the course of his bankruptcy;

(c)	if, after service of a bankruptcy petition on him or after a receiving order is made against him, he removes any goods in his possession above the value of #50 or the aggregate of  #50 in any one period of thirty days without the leave of the Official Receiver or trustee;

(d)	if without good cause shown he fails to attend any examination ordered by the court;

27.	Inquiry as to debtor’s conduct, dealings and property

(1)	The court may, on the application of the Official Receiver or trustee, at any time after a receiving order has been made against a debtor, summon before it the debtor or his wife or any person known or suspected to have in his possession any of the estate or effects belonging to the debtor or supposed to be indebted to the debtor, or any person whom the court may deem capable of giving information re-specting the debtor, his dealing or property, and the court may require any such person to produce any documents in his custody or power relating to the debtor, his dealings or property.

(2)	If any person so summoned, after having been tendered a reasonable sum, refuses to come before the court at the time appointed, or refuses to produce any such documents, having no lawful impediment made known to the court at the time of its sitting and allowed by it, the court may, by warrant, cause him to be apprehended and brought up for examination.

28.	Discharge of bankrupt

(1)	A bankrupt may, at any time after being adjudged bankrupt, apply to the court for an order of discharge, and the court shall appoint a day for hearing the application, but the application shall not be heard until the public examination of the bankrupt is concluded. The application shall, except when the court in accordance with rules under this Act otherwise directs, be heard in open court.

(2)	Where the bankrupt does not of his own accord, within such time as the court may deem rea-sonable, apply for his discharge, the court may, of its own motion or on the application of the Official Receiver or the trustee or any creditor who had proved, make an order calling upon the bankrupt to come up for his discharge on a day to be fixed by the court, and on due service of the order, if the bankrupt does not appear on the day fixed thereby, the court may make such order as it thinks fit, subject to the provisions of this section, and the debtor shall, in addition to any other punishment to which he may be subject, be guilty of a contempt of court and may be punished accordingly.

(b)	suspend the discharge until a dividend of not less than fifty per cent has been paid to the creditors;

(c)	require the bankrupt as a condition of his discharge to consent to judgment being entered against him by the Official Receiver or trustee for any balance or part of any balance of the debts provable under the bankruptcy which is not satisfied at the date of the discharge, such  

balance or part of any balance of the debts to be paid out of the future earnings or after ac-quired property of the bankrupt in such manner and subject to such conditions as the court may direct, but execution shall not be issued on the judgment without leave of the court, which leave may be given on proof that the bankrupt has since his discharge acquired property or income available towards payments of his debts:

Provided further that, if at any time after the expiration of two years from the date of any order made under this section, the bankrupt satisfies the court that there is no reasonable probability of his being in a position to comply with the terms of such order, the court may modify the terms of the order or of any substituted order in such manner and upon such conditions as it may think fit.

(4)	The facts referred to in subsection (3) of this section are—

(a)	that the bankrupt’s assets are not of a value equal to fifty per cent of his unsecured liabilities, unless he satisfies the court that the fact that the assets are not of a value of fifty per cent of his unsecured liabilities has arisen from circumstances for which he cannot justly be held responsible;

(b)	that the bankrupt has omitted to keep such books of account as are usual and proper in the business carried on by him and as sufficiently disclose his business transactions and financial position within the three years immediately preceding his bankruptcy, or in the case of a firm, that a partnership book has not been kept, or that such books have not been available for the trustee during the bankruptcy proceedings, unless they have been accidentally lost or destroyed, the onus of proof of such accidental loss or destruction being on the bankrupt;

(c)	that the bankrupt has continued to trade after knowing himself to be insolvent;

(d) 	that the bankrupt has contracted any debt provable in the bankruptcy without having at the time of contracting it any reasonable or probable ground of expectation (proof whereof shall lie on him) of being able to pay it;

(e) 	that the bankrupt has failed to account satisfactorily for any loss of assets or for any defi-ciency of assets to meet his liabilities;

(f) 	that the bankrupt has brought on or contributed to his bankruptcy by rash and hazardous speculations, or by unjustifiable extravagance in living, or by gambling, or by culpable neglect of his business affairs;

(g)	that the bankrupt has put any of his creditors to unnecessary expense by a frivolous or vexa-tious defence to any action properly brought against him;

(h)	that the bankrupt has brought on or contributed to his bankruptcy by incurring unjustifiable expense by bringing a frivolous or vexatious action;

(i)	that the bankrupt has within three months preceding the date of the receiving order, when un-able to pay his debts as they become due, given an undue preference to any of his creditors;

(j)	that the bankrupt hits within three months preceding the date of the receiving order incurred liabilities with a view to making his assets equal to fifty per cent of his unsecured liabilities;

(k)	that the bankrupt has on any previous occasion, whether in Nigeria or elsewhere, been ad-judged bankrupt or made a composition or arrangement with his creditors;

(l)	that the bankrupt has been guilty of any fraud or fraudulent breach of trust.

(5)	The court may, on proof to its satisfaction of any of the facts mentioned in subsection (4) (6), (c), (d), (f), (g), (h), (i) or (j) of this section, summarily sentence the bankrupt to imprisonment for one year.

(6)	For the purposes of this section, a bankrupt’s assets shall be deemed of a value equal to fifty per cent of his unsecured liabilities when the court is satisfied that the property of the bankrupt has realised or is likely to realise, or with due care in realisation might have realised, an amount of not less than fifty per cent of his unsecured liabilities, and a report by the Official Receiver or the trustee shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of such liabilities.

(7)	For the purposes of this section, the report of the Official Receiver shall be prima facie evidence of the statements therein contained.

(8)	Notice of the appointment by the court of the day for hearing the application for discharge shall be published as the court may direct or as may be prescribed and shall be sent fourteen days at least before the day so appointed to each creditor who has proved, and the court may hear the Official Receiver and the trustee and may also hear any creditor; at the hearing the court may put such questions to the debtor and receive such evidence as it may think fit.

(9)	The powers of suspending and of attaching conditions to a bankrupt’s discharge may be exer-cised concurrently.

(10)	A discharged bankrupt shall, notwithstanding his discharge, give such assistance as the trustee may require in the realisation and distribution of such of his property as is vested in the trustee, and if he fails to do so, he shall be guilty of a contempt of court, and the court may also, if it thinks fit, revoke his discharge, but without prejudice to the validity of any sale, disposition or payment duly made or thing duly done subsequent to the discharge but before its revocation.

29.	Effect of order of discharge

(1)	An order of discharge shall not release the bankrupt—

(a)	from any debt or a recognisance nor from any debt with which the bankrupt may be chargeable at the suit of the State or of any person for any offence against a statute relating to any branch of the public service on a bail bond entered into for the appearance of any person prosecuted for any such offence; or

(b)	from any debt or liability incurred by means of any fraud or fraudulent breach of trust to

which he was a party, or from any debt or liability whereof he has obtained forbearance by any fraud to which he was a party.

(2)	An order of discharge shall release the bankrupt from all other debts provable in bankruptcy.

(3)	An order of discharge shall be conclusive evidence of the bankruptcy and of the validity of the proceedings therein, and in any proceedings that may be instituted against a bankrupt who has obtained an order of discharge in respect of any debt from which he is released by the order, the bankrupt may plead that the cause of action occurred before his discharge.

(4)	An order of discharge shall not release any person who at the date of the receiving order was a partner or co-trustee with the bankrupt or was jointly bound or had made any joint contract with him, or any person who was surety or in the nature of a surety for him.

30.	Power of court to annul adjudication in certain cases

(1)	Where in the opinion of the court a debtor ought not to have been adjudged bankrupt, or where the court is satisfied that the assets for division among the unsecured creditors after payment of all costs, charges and expenses and the debts which are preferential under this Act are not and will not be sufficient to pay a dividend of fifteen per cent, or where it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the debts of die bankrupt are paid in full, the court may, on the application of any person interested, by order annul the adjudication.

(2)	Where an adjudication is annulled under this section, all sales and dispositions of property and payments duly made, and all acts theretofore done by the Official Receiver, trustee or other person acting under their authority, or by the court, shall be valid, but the property of the debtor who was adjudged bankrupt shall vest in such person as the court may appoint, or in default of any such appointment revert to the debtor for all his estate or interest therein on such terms and subject to such conditions, if any, as the court may order.

(3)	Notice of the order annulling an adjudication shall forthwith be published in the Federal Gazette and unless otherwise prescribed shall be advertised in at least two daily newspapers.

(4)	For the purposes of this section, any debt disputed by a debtor shall be considered as paid in full if the debtor enters into a bond, in such sum and with such sureties as the court approves, to pay the amount to be recovered in any proceedings for the recovery of or concerning the debt, with costs, and any debt to a creditor who cannot be found or cannot be identified shall be considered as paid in full if paid into court.

(3)	Save as aforesaid, all debts and liabilities, present or future, certain or contingent, to which the debtor is subject at the date of the receiving order, or to which he may become subject before his dis-charge by reason of any obligation incurred before the date of the receiving order, shall be deemed to be debts provable in bankruptcy.

(5)	Any person aggrieved by any estimate made by the trustee as aforesaid may appeal to the court.

(6)	If in the opinion of the court, the value of the debt or liability is incapable of being fairly estimated, the court may make an order to that effect, and thereupon the debt or liability shall, for the purpose of this Act, be deemed to be a debt not provable in bankruptcy.

(7)	If in the opinion of the court, the value of the debt or liability is capable of being fairly estimated, the court may direct the value to be assessed before the court itself and may give all necessary directions for this purpose, and the amount of the value when assessed shall be deemed to be a debt provable in bankruptcy.

(8)	For the purposes of this Act, 'liability' includes—

(a)	any compensation for work or labour done;

Provided that, in respect of any money paid under any such charge, the landlord or other person shall have the same rights of priority as the person to whom such payment is made.

(5)	This section shall apply in the case of a deceased person who dies insolvent as if he were a bankrupt and as if the date of his death were substituted for the date of the receiving order.

(6)	In the case of partners, the joint estate shall be applicable in the first instance in payment of their joint debts and the separate estate of each partner shall be applicable in the first instance in payment of his separate debts.

[No. 109 of 1992.]

(1)	Where any movable property or negotiable instruments or money of a debtor are taken in execu-tion, and before the receipt or recovery by the judgment creditor of the frill amount of the levy, notice is served on the bailiff that a receiving order has been made against the debtor, the bailiff shall on request deliver the movable property, negotiable instruments or money, or any money received in satisfaction or part satisfaction of the execution, to the Official Receiver, but the costs of the execution shall be a first charge on the property so delivered and the Official Receiver or trustee may sell the movable property or negotiable instruments, or an adequate part thereof, or apply the money, for the purpose of satisfying the charge.

(2)	Where under an execution in respect of a judgment for a sum exceeding N100, the property of a debtor is sold or money is paid in order to avoid sale, the bailiff shall deduct his costs of the execution from the proceeds of sale or the money paid and pay the balance into court, and if within fourteen clear days of such sale or payment as aforesaid a bankruptcy petition is presented by or against the debtor, the said balance shall remain in court and if the debtor is adjudged bankrupt, the balance shall be paid out to the trustee in the bankruptcy, who shall be entitled to retain the same as against the execution creditor, but otherwise it shall be dealt with as if no bankruptcy petition has been presented.

49.	Validity of certain payments to bankrupt and assignee

A payment of money or delivery of property to a person subsequently adjudged bankrupt or to a person claiming by assignment from him shall, notwithstanding anything in this Act, be a good discharge to the person paying the money or delivering the property if the payment or delivery is made before the actual date on which the receiving order is made and without notice of the presentation of a bankruptcy petition, and is either pursuant to the ordinary course of business or otherwise bona fide.

50.	Dealings with undischarged bankrupt

(1)	Where any part of the property of the bankrupt consists of land or any tenure burdened with on-erous covenants, of shares or stock in companies, of unprofitable contracts, or of any other property that is unsaleable, or not readily saleable, by reason of its binding the possessor thereof to the performance of any onerous act or to the payment of any sum of money, the trustee, notwithstanding that he has en-deavoured to sell, or has taken possession of the property or exercised any act of ownership in relation thereto, but subject to the provisions of this section may, by writing signed by him, at any time within twelve months after the first appointment of a trustee or such extended period as may be allowed by the court, disclaim the property:

Provided that, where any such property has not come to the knowledge of the trustee within one month after such appointment, he may disclaim such property at any time within twelve months after he has become aware thereof or such extended period as may be allowed by the court.

(2)	The disclaimer shall operate to determine, as from the date of disclaimer, the rights, interests and liabilities of the bankrupt and his property in or in respect of the property disclaimed, and shall also discharge the trustee from all personal liability in respect of the property disclaimed as from the date when the property vested in him, but shall not, except so far as it is necessary for the purpose of releasing the bankrupt and his property and the trustee from liability, affect the rights or liabilities of any other person.

(3)	A trustee shall not be entitled to disclaim a lease without the leave of the court, except in any cases which may be prescribed by general rules, and the court may, before or on granting such leave, require such notices to be given to persons interested, and impose such orders with respect to fixtures, tenant’s improvements and other matters arising out of the tenancy, as the court thinks just.

(4)	The trustee shall not be entitled to disclaim any property in pursuance of this section in any case where an application in writing has been made to the trustee by any person interested in the property requiring him to decide whether he will disclaim or not and the trustee has for a period of twenty-eight days after the receipt of the application, or such extended period as may be allowed by the court, declined or neglected to give notice whether he disclaims the property or not; and in the case of a contract, if the trustee after such application as aforesaid does not within the said period or extended period disclaim the contract, he shall be deemed to have adopted it.

(6)	The court may, on application by any person claiming either to have any interest in any dis-claimed property or to be under any liability not discharged by this Act in respect of any disclaimed property, and on hearing such persons as it thinks fit, make an order for the vesting of the property in or delivery thereof to any person entitled thereto, or to whom it may seem just that the same should be delivered by way of compensation for such liability as aforesaid, or a trustee for him, and on such term as the court thinks just, and on any such vesting order being made, the property comprised therein shall vest accordingly in the person therein named in that behalf without any conveyance or assignment for the purpose:

Provided that where the property disclaimed is of a leasehold nature, the court shall not make a vesting order in favour of any person claiming under the bankrupt, whether as under-lessee or as mort-gagee by demise except upon the terms of making that person—

(a)	subject to the same liabilities and obligations as the bankrupt was subject to under the lease in respect of the property at the date when the bankruptcy petition was filed; or

(b)	if the court thinks fit, subject only to the same liabilities and obligations as if the lease had been assigned to that person at that date,

and in either event (if the case so requires) subject only to the same liabilities and obligations as if the lease had comprised only the property comprised in the vesting order; and any mortgagee or underlessee declining to accept a vesting order upon such terms shall be excluded from all interest in and security upon the property, and if there is no person claiming under the bankrupt who is willing to accept an order upon such terms, the court shall have power to vest the bankrupt’s estate and interest in the property in any person liable either personally or in a representative character and either alone or jointly with the bankrupt to perform the lessee’s covenants in the lease, freed and discharged from all estates, incumbrances and interests created therein by the bankrupt.

(7)	Where on the release, removal, resignation or death of a trustee in bankruptcy the Official Re-ceiver is acting as trustee, he may disclaim any property which might be disclaimed by a trustee under the foregoing provisions, notwithstanding that the time prescribed by this section for such disclaimer has expired, but such power of disclaimer shall be exercisable only within twelve months after the Official Receiver has become trustee in the circumstances aforesaid or had become aware of the existence of such property, whichever period may last expire.

(2)	In dealing with the proof of the debt the following rules shall be observed—

(a)	any account settled between the debtor and the creditor within three years preceding the date of the receiving order may be examined, and if it appears that the settlement of the account forms substantially one transaction with any debt alleged to be due out of the debtor’s estate (whether in the form of renewal of a loan or capitalisation of interest or ascertainment of loans or otherwise), the account may be re-opened and the whole transaction treated as one;

(b)	any payments made by the debtor to the creditor before the receiving order, whether by way of bonus or otherwise, and any sums received by the creditor before the receiving order from the realisation of any security for the debt shall, notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary, be appropriated to principal and interest in the proportion that the principal bears to the sum payable as interest at the agreed rate;

(c)	where the debt due is secured and the security is realised after the receiving order, or the value thereof is assessed in the proof, the amount realised or assessed shall be appropriated to the satisfaction of principal and interest in the proportion that the principal bears to the sum payable as interest at the agreed rate.

69.	Final dividend

(1)	When the trustee has realised all the property of the bankrupt, or so much thereof as can be real-ised without needlessly protracting the trusteeship, he shall declare a final dividend, but before so doing he shall give notice, in the manner prescribed, to the persons whose claims to be creditors have been notified to him, but not established to his satisfaction, that if they do not establish their claims to the satisfaction of the court within a time limited by the notice, he will proceed to make a final dividend without regard to their claims.

(2)	After the expiration of the time so limited or if the court on application by any such claimant grants him further time for establishing his claim, then on the expiration of such further time, the property of the bankrupt shall be divided among the creditors who have proved their debts, without regard to the claims of any other person.

70.	No action for dividend
