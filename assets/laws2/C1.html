(b)	any currency other than Nigerian currency; and

(c)	any form of property created by the person disposing of it, or otherwise coming to be owned without being acquired,

Gains Chargeable to Tax

6.	Disposal of assets

(1)	Subject to any exceptions provided by this Act there is, for the purposes of this Act, a disposal of assets by a person where any capital sum is derived from a sale, lease, transfer, an assignment, a compulsory acquisition or any other disposition of assets, notwithstanding that no asset is acquired by the person paying the capital sum, and in particular—

(a)	where any capital sum is derived by way of compensation for any loss of office or employment;

(b)	where any capital sum is received under a policy of insurance and the risk of any kind of damage or injury to, or the loss or depreciation of, assets;

(c)	where any capital sum is received in return for forfeiture or surrender of rights, or for refraining from exercising rights;

(d)	where any capital sum is received as consideration for use or exploitation of any asset; and

(e)	without prejudice to paragraph (a) of this subsection, where any capital sum is received in connection with or arises by virtue of any trade, business, profession or vocation.

(2)	In this section and elsewhere in this Act—

(a)	'capital sum' means any money or money’s worth which is not excluded from the consid-eration taken into account in the computation under section 11 of this Act; and

(b)	references to a disposal of assets include, except where the context otherwise requires, refer-ences to a part disposal of assets, and there is a part disposal of assets—

(i)	where an interest or right in or over the assets is created by the disposal, as well as where it subsists before the disposal; and

(ii)	where, on a person making a disposal, any description of property derived from the assets remains undisposed of.

7.	Disposal of assets: provisions as to considerations

(1)	Subject to the provisions of this Act, a person’s acquisition of an asset and the disposal of it to him shall, for the purposes of this Act, be deemed to be for a consideration equal to the market value of the asset—

(a)	where he acquires the asset otherwise than by way of a bargain made at arm’s length;

(b)	where he acquires the asset wholly or partly for a consideration that cannot be valued, or in connection with his own or another’s loss of office or employment or diminution of emolument, or otherwise in consideration for or recognition of his or another’s services or past services in any office or employment or of any other service rendered or to be rendered by him or another, or

(c)	where he acquires the asset as trustee for creditors of the person making the disposal.

(2)	Where a person disposes by way of a gift of an asset acquired by him by way of a gift or otherwise (not being an acquisition on a devolution on death) the person acquiring the asset on that disposal shall, for all purposes of this Act, so far as relates to the interest taken by him, be deemed to have acquired the asset—

(a)	in a case where the amount of the consideration for which the asset was last disposed of by way of a bargain made at arm’s length is ascertainable, for a consideration equal to that amount; and

(b)	in any other case, for a consideration equal to the market value of the asset on the date of that disposal,

and in this subsection 'gift' does not include a donatio mortis causa.

(3)	In relation to any asset held by a person as nominee for another person, or as trustee for another person absolutely entitled as against the trustee, or for any person who would be so entitled but for being an infant or other person under disability (or for two or more persons who are or would be jointly so entitled), this Act shall apply as if the property were vested in, and the acts of the nominee or trustee in relation to the asset were the acts of, the person or persons for whom he is the nominee or trustee (acquisitions from or disposals to him by that person or persons being disregarded accordingly).

(4)	The conveyance or transfer by way of security of an asset or of an interest or right in or over it, or transfer of a subsisting interest or right by way of security in or over an asset (including a re-transfer on redemption of the security), shall not be treated for the purposes of this Act as involving any acquisition or disposal of the asset.

(5)	Where a person entitled to an asset by way of security or to the benefit of a charge or incum-brance on an asset deals with the asset for the purpose of enforcing or giving effect to the security, charge or incumbrance his dealings with it shall be treated for the purpose of this Act as if they were done through him as nominee by the person entitled to it subject to the security, charge or incumbrance; and this subsection shall apply to the dealings of any person appointed to enforce or give effect to the security, charge or incumbrance as receiver and manager or judicial factor as it applies to the dealings of the person entitled as aforesaid.

(6)	An asset shall be treated as having been acquired free of any interest or right by way of security subsisting at the time of any acquisition of it, and as being disposed of free of any such interest or right subsisting at the time of the disposal; and where an asset is acquired subject to any such interest or right the full amount of the liability thereby assumed by the person acquiring the asset shall form part of the consideration for the acquisition and disposal in addition to any other consideration.

(7)	Where an asset is acquired by a creditor in satisfaction of his debt or part thereof, the asset shall not be treated as disposed of by the debtor or acquired by the creditor for a consideration greater than its market value at the time of the creditor’s acquisition of it, and if a chargeable gain accrues to the creditor on a disposal by him of the asset the amount of the chargeable gain (where necessary) shall be reduced so as not to exceed the chargeable gain which would have accrued if he had acquired the property for a consideration equal to the amount of the debt or that part thereof.

8.	Death

(1)	On the death of an individual any assets of which he was competent to dispose of shall for the purposes of this Act be deemed to be disposed of by him at the date of his death and acquired by the personal representatives or other person on whom the assets devolve for a consideration equal to—

(a)	in a case where the amount of the consideration for which the asset was last disposed of by way of a bargain made at arm’s length is ascertainable, that amount; and

(b)	in any other case, the market value of the asset at that date.

(2)	The gains which accrue in consequence of subsection (1) of this section shall not be chargeable to capital gains tax under this Act.

(3)	In relation to property forming part of the estate of a deceased person, the personal representatives shall for the purposes of this Act be treated as being a single and continuous body of persons (distinct from the persons who may from time to time be the personal representatives), and that body shall be treated as having the deceased’s residence and domicile at the date of death.

(4)	On a person acquiring any asset as legatee—

(a) no chargeable gain shall accrue to the personal representatives; and

(b)	the legatee shall be treated as if the personal representatives’ acquisition of the asset had been his acquisition of it.

(5)	In this section, references to assets of which a deceased person was competent to dispose of, are references to assets of the deceased which (otherwise than in right of a power of appointment) he could, if of full age and capacity, have disposed of by his will assuming that all the assets were situated in Nigeria and, if he was not domiciled in Nigeria, that he was domiciled in Nigeria.

(6)	If not more than two years after a death any of the dispositions of the property of which the de-ceased was competent to dispose of whether by will, or under the law relating to intestacies, or otherwise, are varied by deed of family arrangement or similar instrument, this section shall apply as if the variations made by the deed or other instrument were effected by the deceased, and no disposition made by the deed or other instrument shall constitute a disposition for the purposes of this Act.

(7)	In this section—

'legatee' includes any person taking under a testamentary disposition or on an intestacy or partial intestacy, whether he takes beneficially or as trustee, and a donatio mortis causa shall be treated as a testamentary disposition and not as a gift;

'personal representatives' means—

(a)	the executor, original or by representation or administrator for the time being of a deceased person under any law in force in Nigeria;

(b)	persons having in relation to the deceased under the law of another country any functions corresponding to the functions for administration purposes under any law in force in Nigeria or personal representatives as defined under paragraph (a) of this subsection,

and references to personal representatives as such shall be construed as references to the personal

representatives in their capacity as having such functions as aforesaid.

9.	Compulsory acquisition of land

(1)	A person shall not be chargeable to tax under this Act in respect of any acquisition and the dis-posal of land by reference to a disposal to an authority exercising or having compulsory powers, if that person had not—

(a)	acquired the land at a time when he knew or might reasonably have known that it was likely to be acquired by the authority; or

(b)	taken any steps by advertisement or otherwise to dispose of the land or to make his willing-ness to dispose of it known to the authority or others.

(2)	In this section, 'authority exercising or having compulsory powers' means, in relation to any disposal of land, an authority, a person or body of persons acquiring the land compulsorily under the Land Use Act, or any other enactment or law of a country other than Nigeria, or who has or have been, or could be, authorised to acquire it compulsorily for the purposes for which it is acquired, or for whom another authority, person or body of persons has or have been, or could be, authorised so to acquire it.

[Cap. L5.]

10.	Date of acquisition or disposal, etc.

For the purposes of this Act, any asset acquired or disposed of by any person chargeable to capital gains tax shall, subject to section 23 (4) of this Act, be deemed to have been so acquired or disposed of at the date at which there is an enforceable right to acquire or a binding duty to dispose of the asset or any right or interest therein, and in particular—

(а)	where any contract is to be performed subject to any condition, the date of acquisition or disposal of the asset shall be deemed to be the date when the condition is satisfied, but where a consideration of such a contract does not depend solely or mainly on the value of the asset at the time the condition is satisfied, the acquisition or disposal shall be treated as if the con-tract had never been conditional, in which case the date of the acquisition or disposal of the asset shall be the date of the contract;

(b)	where an option is conferred by virtue of any contract, the date of the acquisition or disposal of the asset shall be the date when the option is exercised.

Computation

11.	Computation of capital gains

In the computation of any chargeable gains under this Act, such gains as may be chargeable to tax shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, be the difference between the consideration accruing to any person on a disposal of assets and any sum to be excluded from that consideration, and there shall be added to that sum the amount of the value of any expenditure allowable to such person on such disposal by virtue of this Act.

12.	Exclusion from consideration for disposals of sums chargeable to income tax

(1)	There shall be excluded from the consideration for a disposal of assets taken into account in the computation of the gain accruing on that disposal any money or money’s worth charged to income tax as income of, or taken into account as a receipt in computing income or profits or gains or losses of the person making the disposal for the purposes of the Personal Income Tax Act, the Companies Income Tax Act or the Petroleum Profits Tax Act, which Acts are hereafter jointly referred to as 'the Income Tax Acts”.

[Cap. P8, Cap. C21 and Cap. PI3.]

(2)	Subsection (1) above shall not be taken as excluding from the consideration for the disposal of an asset any money or money’s worth which is taken into account in the making of a balancing charge under the Income Tax Acts.

13.	General provision as to allowable expenditure

(1)	In the computation of capital gains the sums allowable as a deduction from the consideration accruing to a person on the disposal of an asset shall be restricted to—

(a)	the amount or value of the consideration, in money or money’s worth given by him or on his behalf wholly, exclusively and necessarily for the acquisition of the asset, together with the incidental costs to him of the acquisition or, if the asset was not acquired by him, any expen-diture wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred by him in providing the asset;

(b)	any amount of an expenditure wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred on the asset by him or on his behalf for the purposes of enhancing the value of the asset being expenditure reflected in the state or nature of the asset at the time of the disposal;

(c)	the amount of any expenditure wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred on the asset by him or on his behalf in establishing, preserving or defending his title to, or a right over, the asset; and

(d)	the incidental costs to him of making the disposal. 

(2)	For the purposes of this section and any other provision of this Act, the incidental costs to the person making the disposal of the acquisition of the asset or of its disposal shall consist of expenditure wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred by him for the purposes of the acquisition or, as the case may be, the disposal, being fees, commission or remuneration paid for the professional services of any surveyor or valuer, or auctioneer, or accountant, or agent, or legal adviser and costs of transfer or con-veyance (including stamp duties) together—

(a)	in the case of the acquisition of an asset, with costs of advertising to find a seller; and

(b)	in the case of a disposal, with costs of advertising to find a buyer and costs reasonably incurred in making any valuation or apportionment required for the purposes of the computation of the capital gains, including in particular, expenses reasonably incurred in ascertaining market value where required under this Act.

14.	Exclusion of expenditure deductible for income tax purposes

(1)	There shall be excluded from the sum allowable under section 13 of this Act as a deduction in the computation under this Act any expenditure allowable as a deduction in computing the profits or gains or losses of a trade, business, profession or vocation for the purposes of income tax or allowable as a deduction in computing any other income or profits or gains or losses for the purposes of the income or profits or gains or losses for the purposes of the Income Tax Acts and any expenditure which, although not so allowable as a deduction in computing any losses, would be so allowable but for an insufficiency of income or profits or gains; and this section applies irrespective of whether effect is or would be given to the deduction in computing the amount of tax chargeable or by discharge of payment of tax or in any other way.

(2)	Without prejudice to the provisions of subsection (1) of this section, there shall be excluded from the sums allowable under section 13 of this Act as a deduction in the computation under this Act any expenditure which, if the assets, or all the assets to which the computation relates, were, and had at all times been, held or used as part of the fixed capital of a trade or business the profits or gains of which were (irrespective of whether the person making the disposal is a company or not) chargeable to income tax would be allowable as a deduction in computing the profits or gains or losses of the trade for the purposes of income tax.

(3)	The foregoing provisions of this section shall not require the exclusion from the sums allowable as a deduction in the computation under this Act of any expenditure as being expenditure in respect of which capital allowances are granted under the Income Tax Acts.

15.	Special provisions as to deductions allowable: insurance premiums

Without prejudice to section 13 of this Act, there shall be excluded from the sums allowable as a deduction in the computation under this Act of the gain accruing to a person, on the disposal of an asset, any premiums or other payments made under a policy of insurance against the risks of any kind of damage or injury to, loss or depreciation of, any asset.

Miscellaneous

16.	Part disposal

(1)	Where there is a part disposal of an asset within the meaning of section 6 (2) of this Act and generally wherever on the disposal of an asset any description of property derived from that asset remains undisposed of, the sums representing the amount or value of the consideration for the acquisition of the asset (in this Act referred to as 'the cost of acquisition of the asset”) together with any amount of expenditure wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred on the asset for the purposes of enhancing the value of the asset as are attributable to the asset shall, both for the purposes of the computation under this Act and in relation to the property which remains indisposed of, be apportioned.

(2)	Apportionment shall be made by reference—

(a)	to the amount or value of the consideration for the disposal on the one hand (call that amount or value 'A”), and

(b)	to the market value of the property which remains undisposed of on the other hand (call that market value 'B”),

and accordingly the fraction of the said cost or sums allowable as a deduction in computing under

this Act the amount of the gain accruing on the disposal shall be -- and the

A + B

remainder shall be attributed to the property which remains undisposed of.

(3)	Where there is a disposal of an interest or right in or over a chargeable asset created by the dis-posal or where it subsists before the disposal, and on the making of the disposal any description of property derived from the asset remains undisposed of, there shall be apportioned the amount or value of the consideration in money or money’s worth given by him or on his behalf wholly and exclusively for the acquisition of the asset together with the incidental cost to him of the acquisition or any expenditure wholly or exclusively incurred by him in providing the asset as against the market value of the property.

17.	Consideration due after time of disposal

(1)	If the consideration or part of a consideration, taken into account in the computation of capital gains under this Act, is payable by instalments over a period beginning not earlier than the time when the disposal is made, being a period exceeding eighteen months, the chargeable gain accruing on the disposal shall be regarded for all the purposes of this Act as accruing in proportionate parts in the year of assessment in which the disposal is made and in each of the subsequent years of assessment down to and including the year of assessment in which the last instalment is payable.

(2)	The proportionate parts to be recorded as accruing in the respective years of assessment shall correspond to the proportions of the amounts of the instalments of consideration payable in those re-spective years of assessment.

(3)	The time in the year or accounting period when any such part of a chargeable gain is deemed to accrue under this section shall be the last day in that year of assessment.

(4)	Subsection (1) of this section shall not apply to any part of the consideration which has effec-tively passed to the person making the disposal by way of a loan made to that person by the other party to the transaction.

(5)	In the computation of chargeable gains under this Act consideration for the disposal shall be brought into account without any discount for postponement of the right to receive any part of it and, in the first instance, without regard to a risk of any part of the consideration being irrecoverable, or to the right to receive any part of the consideration being contingent; and if any part of the consideration so brought into account is subsequently shown to the satisfaction of the Board to be irrecoverable, such adjustment, whether by way of discharge, or repayment of tax or otherwise, shall be made as is required in consequence.

18.	Assets lost or destroyed

(1)	If an asset, whether under a policy of insurance or otherwise, is lost or destroyed, and a capital sum received by way of compensation for the loss or destruction is applied within three years of receipt in acquiring another asset in replacement of the asset lost or destroyed, the owner shall if he so claims be treated for the purposes of this Act—

(a)	as if the consideration for the disposal of the old asset were (if otherwise of a greater amount) of such amount as would secure that on the disposal neither a loss nor a gain accrues to him; and

(b)	as if the amount of the consideration for the acquisition of the new asset were reduced by the excess of the amount of the capital sum received by way of compensation or under the policy of insurance, together with any residual or scrap value, over the amount of the consideration which he is treated as receiving under paragraph (a) of this subsection.

(2)	A claim shall not be made under subsection (1) of this section if only part of the capital sum is applied in acquiring the new asset but if all of that capital sum except for a part which is less than the amount of the gain (whether all chargeable gain or not) accruing on the disposal of the old asset is so applied, then the owner shall if he so claims be treated for the purposes of this Act—

(a)	as if the amount of the gain so accruing were reduced to the amount of the said part (and, if not all chargeable gain, with a proportionate reduction in the amount of the chargeable gain); and

(b)	as if the amount of the consideration for the acquisition of the new asset were reduced by the amount by which the gain is reduced under paragraph (a) of this subsection.

19.	Bargains comprising of two or more transactions

(1)	Where a single bargain comprises of two or more transactions whereby assets are disposed of, those transactions shall be treated for the purposes of computing capital gains as a single disposal.

(2)	Where separate considerations are agreed or purported to be agreed for any two or more trans-actions comprised in one bargain (whether transactions whereby assets are disposed of or not) those considerations shall be treated as altogether constituting an entire consideration for the transactions and shall be apportionable between them accordingly.

(3)	Where any apportionment under this section shall result in lesser consideration than that agreed (or purported to be agreed) in the bargain being attributable to the disposal of the assets, the separate considerations agreed (or purported to be agreed) in respect of those assets shall be deemed to be the consideration for which those assets are disposed of.

20.	Artificial or fictitious transactions

(1)	Subject to the provisions of this Act, where the Board is of the opinion that any disposition is an artificial or fictitious transaction or where any transaction which reduces or would reduce the amount of any capital gains tax is artificial or fictitious, the Board shall disregard such disposition and may direct that such adjustments shall be made with respect to the liability of any person for the payment of capital gains tax as it considers appropriate so as to counteract the reduction of liability to capital gains tax effected or reduction which would otherwise be effected, by the transaction and any person concerned with such transaction shall be assessable accordingly.

(2)	Any person in respect of whom any direction is made under this section shall have a right of appeal in like manner as though for the purposes of this Act such direction were an assessment to capital gains tax.

(3)	For the purposes of this section—

(a)	'disposition' includes any trust, grant, covenant, agreement or arrangement;

(b)	transactions between connected persons (within the meaning of section 23 of this section) shall be deemed to be artificial or fictitious if in the opinion of the Board those transactions have not been made on terms which might fairly have been expected to have been made by persons engaged in the same or similar activities dealing with one another at arm’s length; and

(c)	in relation to any direction made under this section the provision of this Act as to appeals against an assessment shall have effect as if such direction were an assessment. 

21.	Valuation: market value

(1)	For the purposes of computing capital gains, unless the context otherwise requires, 'market value' in relation to any assets (whether chargeable assets or not) means the prices which those assets might reasonably be expected to fetch on a sale in the open market.

(2)	In estimating the market value of any asset, no reduction shall be made in the estimate on account of the estimate being made on the assumption that the whole of the assets is to be placed on the market at one and the same time.

(3)	In re-estimating the market value of any assets acquired, if the market value exceeds the consid-eration actually paid by the acquirer, the assets shall be deemed to have been acquired for the amount actually paid by the acquirer.

22.	Transactions between connected persons

(1)	This section shall apply where a person acquires an asset and the person making the disposal is connected with him.

(2)	Without prejudice to the generality of section 7 of this Act, the person acquiring the asset and the person making the disposal shall be treated as parties to a transaction otherwise than by way of a bargain made at arm’s length.

(3)	In a case where any asset mentioned in subsection (1) of this section is subject to any right or restriction enforceable by the person making the disposal, or by a person connected with him, then (the amount of the consideration for the acquisition being, in accordance with subsection (2) of this section, deemed to be equal to the market value of the asset) that market value shall be—

(a)	what its market value would be if not subject to the right or restriction minus;

(b)	the market value of the right or restriction or the amount by which its extinction would enhance the value of the asset to its owner, whichever is the less:

Provided that if the right or restriction is of such a nature that its enforcement would or might effectively destroy or substantially impair the value of the asset without bringing any countervailing advantage either to the person making the disposal or a person connected with him or other right to acquire the asset or, in the case of immovable property, is a right to extinguish the asset in the hands of the person giving the consideration by forfeiture or merger or otherwise, that market value of the asset shall be determined, and the amount of the gain accruing on the disposal shall be computed, as if the right or restriction did not exist.

This subsection shall not apply to a right of forfeiture or other right exercisable on breach of a cove-nant contained in a lease of land or other property, and shall not apply to any right or restriction under a mortgage or other charge.

23.	Meaning of 'connected persons'

(1)	Any question whether a person is connected with another shall for the purposes of this Act be determined in accordance with this section (any provision that one person is connected with another being taken to mean that they are connected with one another).

(2)	A person is connected with an individual if that person is the individual’s husband or wife, or is a relative of the individual or of the individual’s husband or wife, or the husband or wife of a relative.

(3)	A person, in his capacity as trustee of a settlement, is connected with any individual who in re-lation to the settlement is a settlor, and with any person who is connected with such an individual.

(4)	A person is connected with any person with whom he is in partnership, and with the husband or wife or a relative of any individual with whom he is in partnership.

(5)	A company is connected with another company—

(b)	if a group of two or more persons have control of each company, and the groups either consist of the same persons or could be regarded as consisting of the same persons by treating (in one or more cases) a member of either group as replaced by a person with whom he is connected.

(6)	A company is connected with another person if that person has control of it or if that person and persons connected with him together have control of it.

(7)	Any two or more persons acting together to secure or exercise control of a company shall be treated in relation to that company as connected with one another and with any person acting on the directions of any of them to secure or exercise control of the company.

(a)	as if the consideration for the disposal of, or of the interest in, the old assets were (if otherwise of a greater amount or value) of such amount as would secure that on the disposal neither a loss nor a gain accrues to him; and

(b)	as if the amount or value of the consideration for the acquisition of, or of the interest in, the new assets were reduced by the excess of the amount or value of the actual consideration for the disposal of, or of the interest in, the old assets over the amount of the consideration which he is treated as receiving under paragraph (a) of this subsection, 

but neither paragraph (a) nor (b) of this subsection shall affect the treatment for the purposes of this Act of the other party to the transaction involving the old assets or of the other party to the transac-tion involving the new assets.

(2)	Subsection (1) of this section shall not apply if only part of the amount or value of the consid-eration for the disposal of, or of the interest in, the old assets is applied as described in that subsection but if all of the amount or value of the consideration except for a part which is less than the amount of the gain (whether all chargeable gain or not) accruing on the disposal of, or of the interest in, the old assets is so applied, then the person carrying on the trade, on making a claim as respects the consideration which has been so applied, shall be treated for the purposes of this Act—

(a)	as if the amount of the gain so accruing were reduced to the amount of the said part (and, if not all chargeable gain, with a proportionate reduction in the amount of the chargeable gain); and

(b)	as if the amount or value of the consideration for the acquisition of, or of the interest in, the new assets were reduced by the amount by which the gain is reduced under paragraph (a) of this subsection,

but neither paragraph (a) nor (b) of this subsection shall affect the treatment for the purposes of this Act of the other party to the transaction involving the old assets or of the other party to the transac-tion involving the new assets.

(3)	This section shall only apply if the acquisition of, or of the interest in, the new assets takes place, or an unconditional contract for the acquisition is entered into, in the period beginning twelve months before and ending twelve months after the disposal of, or of the interest in, the old assets, or at such earlier or later time as the Board may by notice in writing allow:

Provided that, where an unconditional contract for the acquisition is so entered into, this section may be applied on a provisional basis without waiting to ascertain whether the new assets or the interest in the new assets, is acquired in pursuance of the contract, and when that fact is ascertained, all necessary adjustments shall be made by making assessments or by repayment or discharge of tax, and shall be so made notwithstanding any limitation in this Act on the time within which assessments may be made.

(4)	If two or more persons are carrying on a trade in partnership, this section shall not apply in rela-tion to any one of them unless he is, under this Act, to be treated both as making disposal of a share in, or in the interest in, the old assets, and as acquiring a share in, or in the interest in, the new assets; and if those shares are different, that partner’s share shall be taken for the purposes of this section to be the smaller share.

(5)	This section shall not apply unless the acquisition of, or of the interest in, the new assets was made for the purpose of their use in the trade, and not wholly or partly for the purpose of realising a gain from the disposal or, of the interest in, the new assets.

(7)	If, over the period of ownership or any substantial part of the period of ownership, part of a building or structure is, and any part is not, used for the purposes of a trade, this section shall apply as if the part so used, with any land occupied for purposes ancillary to the occupation and use of that part of the building or structure, were a separate asset, and subject to any necessary apportionments of consid-eration for an acquisition or disposal of, or of an interest in, the building or structure and other land.

(8)	If the old assets were not used for the purposes of the trade throughout the period of ownership, this section shall apply as if a part of the asset representing its use for the purposes of the trade having regard to the time and extent to which it was, and was not, used for those purposes, were a separate asset which had been wholly used for the purposes of the trade and this subsection shall apply in relation to that part subject to any necessary apportionment of consideration for an acquisition or disposal of, or of the interest in, the asset.

(9)	This section shall apply in relation to a person who, either successively or at the same time, car-ries on two trades which are in different localities, but which are concerned with goods or services of the same kind, as if, in relation to old assets used for the purposes of the one trade and new assets used for the purposes of the other trade, the two trades were the same.

(10)	This section shall apply with the necessary modifications in relation to a business, profession, vocation or employment as it applied in relation to a trade, and in this section the expressions 'trade”, 'business”, 'profession”, 'vocation' and 'employment' have the same meanings as in the Income Tax Acts, but not so as to apply the provisions of the Income Tax Acts as to the circumstances in which, on a change in the persons carrying on a trade, a trade is to be regarded as discontinued, or as set up and commenced.

(11)	The provisions of this Act fixing the amount of the consideration deemed to be given for the acquisition or disposal of assets shall be applied to this section.

(12)	Without prejudice to the provisions of this Act providing generally for apportionments, where consideration is given for the acquisition or disposal of assets some or part of which are assets in relation to which a claim under subsection (1) or (2) of this section applies, and some or part of which are not, the consideration shall be apportioned in such manner as is just and reasonable.

32.	Exemption of tax on gains arising from take-overs, etc.

A person shall not be chargeable to tax under this Act, in respect of any gains arising from the ac-quisition of the shares of a company either taken over, or absorbed or merged by another company as a result of which the acquired company loses its identity as a limited company, provided that no cash payment is made in respect of the shares acquired.

35.	Rights under policies of insurance, other than life assurance policies

(1)	The rights of the insured under any insurance effected in the course of a capital redemption business shall constitute an asset on the disposal of which a gain may accrue to the person making the disposal but subject to that neither the rights of the insurer nor the rights of the insured under any policy of insurance, whether the risks insured relate to property or not, shall constitute an asset on the disposal of which a gain may accrue.

(2)	Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, sums received under a policy of insurance of the risk of any kind of damage to, or the loss or depreciation of assets are for the purposes of this Act, and in particular for the purposes of section 6 of this Act, sums derived from the assets.

(3)	In this section—

(b)	land which he has for his own occupation and enjoyment with that residence as its garden or

grounds up to an area (inclusive of the site of the dwelling-house) of one acre or such larger area as the Board may in any particular case determine, on being satisfied that, regard being had to the size and character of the dwelling-house, the larger area is required for the reason-able enjoyment of it (or of the part in question) as a residence,

and in the case where part of the land occupied with a residence is and part is not within this subsec-tion, then (up to the permitted area) that part shall be taken to be within this subsection which, if the remainder were separately occupied, would be the most suitable for occupation and enjoyment with the residence.

(4)	If the disposal is of a right or interest in or over tangible movable property—

(a)	in the first instance subsections (1) and (2) of this section shall be applied in relation to the asset as a whole, taking the consideration as including the market value of what remains un-disposed of, in addition to the actual consideration;

(5)	The foregoing provisions of this section shall apply in relation to a gain accruing on a disposal of two or more assets (not necessarily forming part of a set of articles of any description) which are tangible movable properties in the same manner as they apply in relation to a gain accruing on a disposal of an asset, or two or more assets which formed part of a set of articles, if in a year of assessment the total amount or value of the consideration is Nl,000 or more.
