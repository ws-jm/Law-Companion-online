126.	Allotment as acceptance of contract

An allotment of shares made and notified to an applicant in accordance with section 125 of this Act shall be an acceptance by the company of the offer by the applicant to purchase its shares and the contract takes effect on the date on which the allotment is made by the company.

127.	Payment on allotment

Subject to the provisions of sections 135 to 138 of this Act, a company may, in its articles, make provision with respect to payments on allotment of its shares.

128.	Effect of irregular allotment

(1)	An allotment made by a company before the holding of the statutory meeting to an applicant in contravention of the provisions of this Act, shall be voidable at the instance of the applicant within one month after the holding of the statutory meeting of the company and not later, or where the allotment is made after the holding of the statutory meeting, within one month after the date of the allotment, and not later, and the allotment shall be so voidable notwithstanding that the company is in the course of being wound up.

(2)	If any director of a company knowingly contravenes or permits or authorises the contravention of any of the provisions of this Act with respect to allotment, he shall be liable to compensate the company and the allottee respectively for any loss, damages or costs which the company or the allottee may have sustained or incurred thereby:

Provided that proceedings to recover any such loss, damages, or costs shall not be commenced after the expiration of two years from the date of the allotment.

129.	Return as to allotment

(1)	Whenever a company limited by shares makes any allotment of its shares, the company shall within one month thereafter deliver to the Commission for registration—

Provided that, in case of default in delivering to the Commission within one month after the allotment any document required to be delivered by this section, the company or any officer liable for the default, may apply to the court for relief, and the court, if satisfied that the omission to deliver the document was accidental or due to inadvertence or that it is just and equitable to grant relief, may make an order extending the time for the delivery of the document for such period as the court may think proper.

Commissions and discounts

130.	Prohibition of payments of commissions, discounts out of shares and capital

(1)	Except as provided in section 131 of this Act, no company shall apply any of its shares or capital money either directly or indirectly in payment of any commission, discount or allowance to any person in consideration of his subscribing or agreeing to subscribe, whether absolutely or conditionally, for any shares in the company, or procuring or agreeing to procure subscriptions, whether absolute or conditional, for any shares in the company, whether the shares or capital money are so applied by being added to the purchase money of any property acquired by the company or to the contract price of any work to be executed for the company, or any such money is paid out of the nominal purchase money or contract price, or otherwise.

(2)	Nothing in this section shall affect the payment of any brokerage as is usual for a company to pay.

(3)	A vendor to, promoter of, or other person who receives payment in money or shares from a company, shall have and shall be deemed always to have had power to apply any part of the money or shares so received in payment of any commission, the payment of which, if made directly by the company, would have been legal under this section.

131.	Power to pay commission in certain cases

(1)	It shall be lawful for a company to pay a commission to any person in consideration of his sub-scribing or agreeing to subscribe, whether absolutely or conditionally, for any shares in the company or procuring or agreeing to procure subscription, whether absolute or conditional, for any shares in the company if—

(c)	the amount or rate per cent of the commission paid or agreed to be paid is—

(i) in the case of shares offered to the public for subscription disclosed in the prospectus; or

(ii) in the case of shares not offered to the public for subscription, disclosed in the statement in lieu of prospectus, or in a statement in the prescribed form signed in like manner as a statement in lieu of prospectus, and delivered before the payment of the commission to the Commission for registration, and where a circular or notice, not being a prospectus inviting subscription for the shares is issued, also disclosed in that circular or notice; and

(d)	the number of shares which persons have agreed for a commission to subscribe absolutely is disclosed in the manner specified in this section.

Call on and payment for shares

133.	Call on shares

(1)	Subject to the terms of the issue of the shares and of the articles, the directors may from time-to- time make calls upon the members in respect of any monies unpaid on their shares (whether on account of the nominal value of the shares or by way of premium) and not by the conditions of allotment of the shares made payable at fixed times:

Provided that no call shall exceed one fourth of the nominal value of the share or be payable at less than one month from the date fixed for the payment of the last preceding call, and each member shall (subject to receiving at least fourteen days’ notice specifying the time or times and place of payment) pay to the company at the time or times and place so specified the amount called on his shares, so however that a call may be revoked or postponed as the directors may determine.

(2)	A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the directors authorising the call was passed, and may be required to be paid by instalments.

(3)	The joint holders of a share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay all calls in respect of the share.

(4)	If a sum called in respect of a share is not paid before or on the day appointed for payment, the person from whom the sum is due shall pay interest on the sum from the day appointed for payment to the time of actual payment at such rate not exceeding the current bank rate per annum, as the directors may determine, but the directors shall be at liberty to waive payment of such interest wholly or in part.

(5)	Any sum which by the terms of issue of a share becomes payable on allotment or at any fixed date, whether on account of the nominal value of the shares or by way of premium shall, for the purposes of these provisions, be deemed to be a call duly made and payable on the date on which by the terms of issue the same becomes payable, and in case of non-payment, all the relevant provisions of this Act as to payment of interest and expenses, forfeiture or otherwise shall apply as if such sum had become payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified.

(6)	The directors may, if they think fit, receive from any member willing to advance the same, all or any part of the monies uncalled and unpaid upon any shares held by him; and upon all or any of the monies so advanced may (until the same would but for such advance, become payable) pay interest at such rate not exceeding (unless the company in general meeting shall otherwise direct) the current bank rate per annum as may be agreed upon between the directors and the member paying such sum in advance.

134.	Reserve liability of company having share capital

A company limited by shares may by special resolution determine that any portion of its share capital which has not been already called up shall not be capable of being called up except in the event and for the purposes of the company being wound up; and thereupon that portion of its share capital shall not be capable of being called up, except in the event and for the purposes specified in this section.

135.	Payment for shares

Subject to the provisions of sections 136 and 137 of this Act, the shares of a company and any premium on them shall be paid up in cash, or where the articles so permit, by a valuable consideration other than cash or partly in cash and partly by a valuable consideration other than cash.

136.	Meaning of payment in cash

Shares shall not be deemed to have been paid for in cash except to the extent that the company shall actually have received cash for them at the time of, or subsequently to, the agreement to issue the shares, and where shares are issued to a person who has sold or agreed to sell property or rendered or agreed to render services to the company or to persons nominated by him, the amount of any payment made for the property or services shall be deducted from the amount of any cash payment made for the shares and only the balance (if any) shall be treated as having been paid in cash for such shares notwithstanding any exchange of cheques or other securities for money.

137.	Payment other than in cash

(1)	Where a company agrees to accept payment for its shares otherwise than wholly in cash, it shall appoint an independent valuer who shall determine the true value of the consideration other than cash and prepare and submit to the company a report on the value of the consideration.

(2)	The valuer shall be entitled to require from the officers of the company such information and explanation as he thinks necessary to enable him to carry out the valuation or make the report under subsection (3) of this section.

(3)	The company shall, not more than three days after the receipt by it of the valuer’s report, send a copy of it to the proposed purchaser of shares, and indicate to the proposed purchaser whether or not it intends to accept the consideration as payment or part-payment for its shares.

(4)	A company shall not accept as payment or part-payment for its shares consideration other than cash unless the cash value of the consideration as determined by the valuer is worth at least as much as may be credited as paid up in respect of the shares allowed to the proposed purchaser.

(5)	A valuer who, in his report or otherwise, knowingly or recklessly makes a statement which is misleading, false or deceptive in a material particular, shall be guilty of an offence and liable to imprisonment for twelve months or to a fine of N1,000 or both such imprisonment and fine.

(6)	For the purposes of this section, 'valuer' means an auditor, a valuer, a surveyor or engineer or an accountant not being a person in the employment of the company nor an agent or associate of the company or any of its directors or officers.

[No. 46 of 1991.]

138.	Power to pay different amounts on shares

To the extent to which it is so authorised by its articles, a company may—

(a)	make arrangements on the issue of shares for a difference between the shareholders in the amounts and times of payment of calls on their shares;

(b)	accept from any member the whole or a part of the amount remaining unpaid on any shares held by him, although no part of that amount has been called up;

(c)	pay dividend in proportion to the amount paid up on each share where a larger amount is paid up on some shares than on others.

Lien and forfeiture of shares

139.	Lien on shares

(1)	A company shall have a first and paramount lien on every share, (not being a fully paid share for all monies (whether currently payable or not) called or payable at a fixed time in respect of that share, and the company shall also have a first and paramount lien on all shares (other than fully paid shares) standing registered in the name of a single person for all monies presently payable by him or his estate to the company, but the directors may at any time declare any share to be wholly or in part exempt from the provisions of this subsection.

(2)	A company’s lien, if any, on a share shall extend to all dividends payable on it.

(3)	A company may sell, in such manner as the directors think fit, any shares on which the company has a lien, but no sale shall be made unless a sum in respect of which the lien exists is currently payable, nor until the expiration of fourteen days after a notice in writing, stating and demanding payment of such part of the amount in respect of which the lien exists as is currently payable, has been given to the registered holder for the time being of the shares, or the person entitled to them by reason of his death or bankruptcy.

(4)	For the purpose of giving effect to any such sale, the directors may authorise some person to transfer the shares sold to the purchaser of the shares and the purchaser shall be registered as the holder of the shares comprised in any such transfer.

(5)	The purchaser shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money and his title to the shares shall not be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the sale.

140.	Forfeiture of shares

(1)	If a member fails to pay any call or instalment of a call on the day appointed for payment, the directors may, at any time thereafter during such time as any part of the call or instalment remains unpaid, serve a notice on him requiring payment of so much of the call or instalment as is unpaid, together with any interest which may have accrued.

(2)	The notice shall name a further day (not earlier than the expiration of fourteen days from the date of service of the notice) on or before which the payment required by the notice is to be made, and it shall state that in the event of non-payment at or before the time appointed, the shares in respect of which the call was made shall be liable to be forfeited.

(3)	If the requirements of any such notice as is mentioned in subsections (1) and (2) of this section are not complied with, any share in respect of which notice has been given may at any time thereafter, before the payment required by the notice has been made, be forfeited by a resolution of the directors to that effect.

(4)	A forfeited share may be sold or otherwise disposed of on such terms and in such manner as the directors think fit, and at any time before a sale or disposition, the forfeiture may be cancelled on such terms as the directors think fit.

(5)	A person whose shares have been forfeited shall cease to be a member in respect of the forfeited shares, but shall, notwithstanding, remain liable to pay to the company all monies which, at the date of forfeiture, were payable by him to the company in respect of the shares, but his liability shall cease if and when the company receives payment in full of all such monies in respect of the shares.

(6)	A statutory declaration that the declarant is a director or the secretary of the company, and that a share in the company has been duly forfeited on a date stated in the declarations, shall be prima facie evidence of the facts stated in it as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the shares.

(7)	The company may receive the consideration, if any, given for the share on any sale or disposition of it and may execute a transfer of the share in favour of the person to whom the share is sold or disposed of, and he shall thereupon be registered as the holder of the share, and shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money, if any, nor shall his title to the share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings in reference to the forfeiture, sale or disposal of the share.

(8)	The provisions of this section as to forfeiture shall apply in the case of non-payment of any sum which, by the terms of issue of a share, becomes payable at a fixed time, whether on account of the nominal value of the share or by way of premium, as if the same had been payable by virtue of a call duly made and notified.

Classes of shares

141.	Power to vary rights

(1)	If at any time the share capital of a company is divided into different classes of shares under section 118 of this Act, the rights attached to any class (unless otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the shares of that class) may, whether or not the company is being wound up, be varied with the consent, in writing, of the holders of three-quarters of the issued shares of that class, or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate general meeting of the holders of the shares of the class.

(2)	To every such separate general meeting as is mentioned in subsection (1) of this section, the provisions of this Act relating to general meetings shall apply, so however that the necessary quorum shall be two persons at least holding or representing by proxy one-third of the issued shares of the class and that any holder of shares of the class present in person or by proxy may demand a poll.

(3)	The rights conferred upon the holders of the shares of any class issued with preferred or other rights shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided by the terms of issue of the shares of that class, be deemed to be varied by the creation or issue of further shares ranking pari passu with them.

142.	Application for cancellation of variation

(1)	Where in pursuance of section 141 of this Act, the rights attached to any class of shares are at any time varied, the holder of not less in the aggregate than fifteen per cent of the issued shares of that class, being persons who did not consent to or vote in favour of the resolution for the variation, may apply to the court to have the variation cancelled, and, where any such application is made, the variation shall not have effect, unless and until it is confirmed by the court.

(2)	An application to the court under this section shall, in a proper case, be made within twenty-one days after the date on which the consent was given or the resolution was passed, as the case may be, and may be made on behalf of the shareholders entitled to make the application or by such one or more of their number as they may appoint in writing for the purpose.

(3)	If on any such application the court, after hearing the applicant and any other persons applying to it to be heard and appearing to be interested in the application, is satisfied that the variation would  

unfairly prejudice the shareholders of the class represented by the applicant, the court, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, may disallow the variation, and shall, if not satisfied, confirm the variation.

(4)	The decision of the court on any such application shall be final.

(5)	The company shall, within fifteen days after the making of an order by the court on an application to it under this section, forward a copy of the order to the Commission and if default is made in complying with the provisions of this subsection, the company and every officer of the company who is in default shall be liable to a fine of N50 for every day during which the default continues.

(6)	In this section, 'variation' includes abrogation and cognate expressions shall be constructed accordingly.

143.	Right of a preference share to more than one vote

(1)	Notwithstanding the provisions of section 116 of this Act, the articles may provide that preference shares issued after the commencement of this Act shall carry the rights to attend general meetings and on a poll at the meetings, to more than one vote per share in the following circumstances, but not otherwise, that is to say—

(a)       upon any resolution during such period as the preferential dividend or any part of it remains in arrears and unpaid, such period starting from a date not more than twelve months or such lesser period as the articles may provide, after the due date of the dividend; or

(b)	upon any resolution which varies the rights attached to such shares; or

(c)	upon any resolution to remove an auditor of the company or to appoint another person in place of such auditor; or

(d)	upon any resolution for the winding-up of the company or during the winding-up of the company.

(2)	Notwithstanding the provisions of section 116 of this Act, any special resolution of a company increasing the number of shares of any class, may validly resolve that any existing class of preference shares shall carry the right to such votes additional to one vote per share as shall be necessary in order to preserve the existing ratio which the votes exercisable by the holders of such preference shares at a general meeting of the company bear to the total votes exercisable at the meeting.

(3)	For the purposes of subsection (2) of this section, a dividend shall be deemed to be due on the date appointed in the articles for the payment of the dividend for any year or other period, or if no such date is appointed, upon the day immediately following the expiration of the year or other period, and whether or not such dividend shall have been earned or declared.

144.	Construction of class rights

In construing the provisions of a company’s articles in respect of the rights attached to shares, the following rules of construction shall be observed—

(a)	unless the contrary intention appears, no dividend shall be payable on any shares unless the company shall resolve to declare such dividend;

(b)	unless the contrary intention appears, a fixed preferential dividend payable on any class of shares is cumulative, that is to say, no dividend shall be payable on any shares ranking sub-sequent to them until all the arrears of the fixed dividend have been paid;

(c)	unless the contrary intention appears, in a winding-up arrears of any cumulative preferential dividend, whether earned or declared or not, are payable up to the date of actual payment in the winding-up;

(d)	if any class of shares is expressed to have a right to a preferential dividend, then, unless the contrary intention appears, such class has no further right to participate in dividends;

(e)	if any class of shares is expressed to have preferential rights to payment out of the assets of the company in the event of winding-up, then unless the contrary intention appears, such class has no further right to participate in the distribution of assets in the winding-up;

(f)       in determining the rights of the various classes to share in the distribution of the company’s property on a winding-up, no regard shall be paid, unless the contrary intention appears, to whether or not such property represents accumulated profits or surplus which would have been available for dividend while the company remained a going concern;

(g)	subject to this section, all shares rank equally in all respects unless the contrary intention

appears in the company’s articles.

Numbering of shares

145.	Shares to be numbered

Each share in a company having a share capital shall be distinguished by its appropriate number:

Provided that, if at any time all the issued shares in a company, or all of its issued shares of a par-ticular class, are fully paid up and rank pari passu for all purposes, none of those shares need thereafter have a distinguishing number so long as it remains fully paid up and ranks pari passu for all purposes with all shares of the same class for the time being issued and fully paid up.

Share certificates

146.	Issue of share certificates

(1)	Every company shall, within two months after the allotment of any of its shares and within three months after the date on which a transfer of any such shares is lodged with the company, complete and have ready for delivery the certificates of all shares allotted or transferred, unless the conditions of issue of the shares otherwise provide.

(2)	Every person whose name is entered as a member in the register of members shall be entitled, without payment, to receive within three months of allotment or lodgement of transfer or within such other period as the conditions of issue shall provide, one certificate for all his shares or several certificates each for one or more of his shares upon payment of a fee as the directors shall, from time-to-time, determine.

(3)	Every certificate issued by a company shall be under the company’s seal and shall specify the shares to which it relates and the amount paid up on them:

Provided that in respect of shares held jointly by several persons, the company shall not be bound to issue more than one certificate, and delivery of a certificate for shares to one of several joint holders shall be sufficient delivery to all such holders.

(4)	If a share certificate is defaced, lost or destroyed, it may be replaced on such terms (if any), as to evidence and indemnity and the payment of out-of-pocket expenses of the company of investigating evidence as the directors think fit.

(5)	If any company on which a notice has been served requiring it to make good any default in complying with the provisions of subsection (1) of this section, fails to make good the default within ten days after the service of the notice, the court may, on the application of the person entitled to have the certificate delivered to him, make an order directing the company and any officer of the company to make good the default within such time as may be specified in the order, and any such order may provide that all costs of and incidental to the application shall be borne by the company or by any officer of the company responsible for the default.

(6)	If default is made in complying with this section, the company and every officer of the company who is in default, shall be liable to a fine of N50 for every day during which the default continues.

(7)	In this section, 'transfer' means a transfer duly stamped and otherwise valid, but does not include a transfer which under this Act a company is for any reason entitled to refuse to, and does not, register.

147.	Effect of share certificate

(1)	A certificate, under the common seal of the company, specifying any shares held by any member, shall be prima facie evidence of the title of the member to the shares.

(2)	If any person changes his position to his detriment in good faith on the continued accuracy of the statements made in a certificate, the company shall be estopped from denying the continued accuracy of such statements and shall compensate the person for any loss suffered by him in reliance on them and which he would not have suffered had the statements been or continued to be accurate.

(3)	Nothing contained in subsection (2) of this section shall derogate from any right the company may have to be indemnified by any other person.

148.	Probate, etc., as evidence of grant

The production to a company of any document which is by law sufficient evidence of probate of the will, or letters of administration of the estate, or confirmation as executor, of a deceased person having been granted to some person, shall be accepted by the company as sufficient evidence of the grant, notwithstanding anything in its articles to the contrary.

149.	Abolition of share warrants

(1)	As from the date of commencement of this Act, no company shall have the power to issue warrants.

(2)	Every company shall within a period of thirty days from the date of commencement of this Act, cancel any share warrants previously issued by it which are still valid on that date and enter in its register of members the names and relevant particulars of the bearers of the share warrants.

(3)	A person whose name is entered in a company’s register of members by virtue of subsection (2) of this section, shall be deemed to be a member of the company with effect from the date on which the share warrant thereby cancelled, was issued.

Conversion of shares into stock

150.	Conversion of shares into stock

(1)	The provisions of this section shall apply with respect to the conversion of all or any of the shares of a company into stock and the re-conversion of such stock into shares under the provisions of section 100 of this Act.

(2)	The conversion of any paid-up shares into stock and the re-conversion of any stock into paid-up shares shall be by ordinary resolution of the company at a general meeting.

(3)	The holders of stock may transfer the same, or any part of it, in the same manner and subject to the same conditions, as and subject to which the shares from which the stock arose might, previous to the conversion, have been transferred, or as near to it as circumstances admit, and the directors may, from time-to-time, fix the minimum amount of stock transferable, so however that such minimum shall not exceed the nominal amount of the shares from which the stock arose.

(4)	The holders of stock shall, according to the amount of stock held by them, have the same rights, privileges and advantages as regards dividends, voting at meetings of the company and other matters as if they held the shares from which the stock arose, but no such privilege or advantage (except participation in the dividends and profit of the company and in the assets on winding-up) shall be conferred by an amount of stock which would not, if existing in shares, have conferred that privilege or advantage.

(5)	Such of the articles of the company as are applicable to paid-up shares shall apply to stock, and the words 'shares' and 'shareholder' in those articles shall include 'stock' and 'stockholder”.

Transfer and transmission

151.	Transfer of shares

(1)	The transfer of a company’s shares shall be by instrument of transfer and except as expressly provided in the articles, transfer of shares shall be without restrictions.

(2)	Notwithstanding anything in the articles of a company, it shall not be lawful for the company to register a transfer of shares in the company, unless a proper instrument of transfer has been delivered to the company:

Provided that nothing in this section shall prejudice any power of the company to register as shareholder, any person to whom the right to any shares in the company has been transmitted by operation of law.

(3)	The instrument of transfer of any share shall be executed by or on behalf of the transferor and transferee, and the transferor shall be deemed to remain a holder of the share until the name of the transferee is entered in the register of members in respect of the share.

(4)	Subject to such of the restrictions of a company’s articles as may be applicable, any member may transfer all or any of his shares by instrument in writing in any usual or common form or any other form which the directors may approve.

152.	Entry in register of transfers

(1)	On the application of the transferor of any share or interest in a company, the company shall enter in its register of members, the name of the transferee in the same conditions as if the application for the entry were made by the transferee.

(2)	Until the name of the transferee is entered in the register of members in respect of the transferred shares, the transferor shall, so far as concerns the company, be deemed to remain the holder of the shares.

(3)	The company may refuse to register the transfer of a share (not being a fully paid share) to a person of whom they do not approve, and may also refuse to register the transfer of a share on which the company has a lien.

(4)	The company may refuse to recognise any instrument of transfer unless—

(a)	a fee as the company may, from time-to-time, determine is paid to the company in respect of the instrument; and

(b)	the instrument of transfer is accompanied by the certificate of the shares to which it relates and such other evidence as the directors may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer; and

(c)	the instrument of transfer is in respect of only one class of shares.

153.	Notice of refusal to register

(1)	If a company refuses to register a transfer of any shares it shall, within two months after the date on which the transfer was lodged with it, send notice of the refusal to the transferee.

(2)	If default is made in complying with this section, the company and every officer of the company who is in default shall be liable to a fine of N200. 

154.	Transfer by personal representative

A transfer of the share or other interest of a deceased member of a company made by his personal representative shall, although the personal representative is not himself a member of the company, be as valid as if he had been such a member at the time of the execution of the instrument of transfer.

155.	Transmission of shares

(1)	In case of the death of a member, the survivor or survivors where the deceased was a joint holder, or the legal personal representative of the deceased where he was a sole holder, shall be the only persons recognised by the company as having any title to his interest in the shares, but nothing in this section shall release the estate of a deceased joint holder from any liability in respect of any share which had been jointly held by him with other persons.

(2)	Any person becoming entitled to a share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a member may, upon such evidence being produced as may, from time-to-time, properly be required by the directors and subject as hereafter provided in this section, elect either to be registered himself as holder of the share, or to have some person nominated by him registered as the transferee of the share, but the company shall, in either case, have the same right to decline or suspend registration as they would have had in the case of a transfer of the share by that member before his death or bankruptcy, as the case may be.

(3)	If the person so becoming entitled elects to be registered himself, he shall deliver or send to the company a notice in writing signed by him stating that he so elects and if he elects to have another person registered, he shall testify his election by executing to that person a transfer of the share.

(4)	All the limitations, restrictions and provisions of this Act and the company’s articles relating to the rights to transfer and the registration of transfers of share, shall be applicable to any such notice or transfer as mentioned in subsection (3) of this section as if the death or bankruptcy of the member had not occurred and the notice or transfer were a transfer signed by that member.

(5)	A person becoming entitled to a share by reason of the death or bankruptcy of the holder, shall be entitled to the same dividends and other advantages to which he would be entitled if he were the registered holder of the share, except that he shall not, unless the articles otherwise provide, before being registered as a member in respect of the share, be entitled in respect of it to exercise any right conferred by membership in relation to meetings of the company:

Provided that the directors may at any time give notice requiring any such person to elect either to be registered himself or to transfer the share, and if the notice is not complied with within ninety days the directors may thereafter withhold payment of all dividends, bonuses or other monies payable in respect of the share until the requirements of the notice have been complied with.

156.	Protection of beneficiaries

(1)	Any person claiming to be interested in any shares or the dividends or interest on them, may protect his interest by serving on the company concerned a notice and affidavit of interest.

(2)	Notwithstanding the provisions of section 86 of this Act, the company shall enter on the register of members, the fact that such notice has been served and shall not register any transfer or make any payment or return in respect of the shares contrary to the terms of the notice until the expiration of forty-two days’ notice to the claimant of the proposed transfer or payment.

(3)	In the event of any default by the company in complying with this section, the company shall compensate any person injured by the default.

157.	Certification of transfers

(1)	When the holder of any shares of a company wishes to transfer to any person only a part of the shares represented by one or more certificates, the instrument of transfer together with the relevant cer-tificates shall be delivered to the company with a request that the instrument of transfer be recognised and registered.

(2)	A company to which a request is made under subsection (1) of this section, may recognise the instrument of transfer by endorsing on it the words 'certificate lodged' or words to the like effect.

(3)	The recognition by a company of any instrument of transfer of shares in the company shall be taken as a representation by the company to any person acting on the faith of the recognition that there have been produced to the company such documents as on the face of them show a prime facie title to the shares in the transferor named in the instrument of transfer, but not as a representation that the transferor has any title to the shares.

(4)	Where any person acts on the faith of a false recognition by a company made negligently, the company shall be under the same liability to that person as if the recognition has been made fraudulently.

(5)	For the purposes of this section—

(a)	an instrument of transfer shall be deemed to be recognised if it bears the words 'certificate lodged' or words to the like effect;

(b)	the recognition of an instrument of transfer shall deemed to be made by a company if—

(i)	the person issuing the instrument is a person authorised to issue certificated instru-ments of transfers on the company’s behalf; and

(ii)	the recognition is signed by a person authorised to recognise transfers of shares on the company’s behalf or by any officer or servant either of the company or of a body corporate so authorised;

(c)	a recognition shall be deemed to be signed by any person if—

(i)	it purports to be authenticated by his signature or initials (whether hand written or not); and

(ii)	it is not shown that the signature or initials was or were placed there by any person other than him or a person authorised to use the signature or initials for the purpose of transfers on the company’s behalf.

Transactions by company in respect of its own shares

158.	Redemption of redeemable preference shares

(1)	The provisions of this section shall apply with respect to the redemption by a company of any redeemable preference shares issued by it under section 122 of this Act.

(2)	The shares shall not be redeemed unless they are fully paid, and redemption shall be made only out of—

(a) profits of the company which would otherwise be available for dividend; or

(b) the proceeds of a fresh issue of shares made for the purposes of the redemption.

(3)	Before the shares are redeemed, the premium, if any, payable on redemption, shall be provided for out of the profits of the company or out of the company’s share premium account.

(4)	Where shares are redeemed otherwise than out of the proceeds of a fresh issue, there shall, out of profits which would otherwise have been available for dividend, be transferred to a reserve fund, to be called 'the capital redemption reserve fund”, a sum equal to the nominal amount of the shares redeemed, and the provisions of this Act relating to the reduction of the share capital of a company shall, except as provided in this section, apply as if the capital redemption reserve fund were paid-up share capital of the company.

(5)	Subject to the provisions of this section, the redemption of preference shares thereunder may be effected on such terms and in such manner as are provided by the articles of the company.

(6)	The redemption of preference shares under this section by a company shall not be taken as re-ducing the amount of the company’s authorised share capital.

(7)	Where, in pursuance of this section, a company has redeemed or is about to redeem any preference shares, it shall have power to issue shares up to the nominal amount of the shares redeemed or to be redeemed as if those shares had never been issued, and accordingly, the share capital of the company shall not, for the purposes of any enactments relating to stamp duty, be deemed to be increased by the issue of shares in pursuance of this subsection:

Provided that, where new shares are issued before the redemption of the old shares, the new shares shall not, so far as relates to stamp duty, be deemed to have been issued in pursuance of this subsection, unless the old shares are redeemed within one month after the issue of the new shares.

(8)	The capital redemption reserve fund may, notwithstanding anything in this section, be applied by the company in paying up unissued shares of the company to be issued to members of the company as fully paid bonus shares.

159.	Prohibition of financial assistance by company for acquisition of its shares

(1)	In this section, financial assistance includes a gift, guarantee, security or indemnity, loan, any form of credit and any financial assistance given by a company, the net assets of which are thereby reduced to a material extent or which has no net assets.

(2)	Subject to the provisions of this section—

(a)	where a person is acquiring or is proposing to acquire shares in a company, it shall not be lawful for the company or any of its subsidiaries to give financial assistance directly or indirectly for the purpose of that acquisition before or at the same time as the acquisition takes place; and

(b)	where a person has acquired shares in a company and any liability has been incurred (by that or any other person), for the purpose of this acquisition, it shall not be lawful for the company or any of its subsidiaries to give financial assistance directly or indirectly for the purpose of reducing or discharging the liability so incurred.

(3)	Nothing in subsection (1) of this section shall be taken to prohibit—

(a)	the lending of money by the company in the ordinary course of its business, where the lending of money is part of the ordinary business of a company;

(b)	the provision by a company, in accordance with any scheme for the time being in force, of money for the purchase of, or subscription for, fully paid shares in the company or its holding company, being a purchase or subscription by trustees of or for shares to be held by or for the benefit of employees of the company, including any director holding a salaried employment or office in the company;

(c)	the making by a company of loans to persons, other than directors, bona fide in the employment of the company with a view to enabling those persons to purchase or subscribe for fully paid shares in the company or its holding company, to be held themselves by way of beneficial ownership;

(d)	any act or transaction otherwise authorised by law. 

(4)	If a company acts in contravention of this section, the company and every officer of the company who is in default shall be liable to a fine not exceeding ##500.

160.	Acquisition by a company of its own shares

(1)	Subject to the provisions of subsection (2) of this section and its articles, a company may not purchase or otherwise acquire shares issued by it.

(2)	A company may acquire its own shares for the purpose of—

(a)      settling or compromising a debt or claim asserted by or against the company; or

(b)	eliminating fractional shares; or

(c)	fulfilling the terms of a non-assignable agreement under which the company has an option or is obliged to purchase shares owned by an officer or an employee of the company; or

(d)	satisfying the claim of a dissenting shareholder; or

(e)	complying with a court order.

(3)	A company may accept from any shareholder, a share in the company surrendered to it as a gift, but may not extinguish or reduce a liability in respect of an amount unpaid on any such share, except in accordance with section 106 of this Act.

161.	Conditions for purchase by a company of its own shares

Notwithstanding any provision in the articles, a company shall not purchase any of its own shares except on compliance with the following conditions, that is—

(a)	shares shall only be purchased out of profits of the company which would otherwise be available for dividend or the proceeds of a fresh issue of shares made for the purpose of the purchase;

(b)	redeemable shares shall not be purchased at a price greater than the lowest price at which they are redeemable or shall be redeemable at the next date thereafter at which they are due or liable to be redeemed;

(c)	no purchase shall be made in breach of section 162 of this Act.

162.	Limit on number of shares acquired

No transaction shall be entered into by or on behalf of a company whereby the total number of its shares, or of its shares of any one class, held by persons other than the company or its nominees becomes less than eighty-five per cent of the total number of shares, or of shares of that class, which have been issued:

Provided that—

(a)	redeemable shares shall be disregarded for the purposes of this section; and

(b)	where, after shares of any class have been issued, the number of such shares has been reduced, this section shall apply as if the number originally issued (including shares of that class cancelled before the reduction took effect) has been the number as so reduced.

163.	Enforceability of contract to acquire shares

(1)	A contract with a company providing for the acquisition by the company of shares in the company is specifically enforceable against the company, except to the extent that the company cannot perform the contract without thereby being a breach of the provisions of section 160 of this Act.

(2)	In any action brought on a contract referred to in subsection (1) of this section, the company shall have the burden of proving that performance of the contract is prevented by the provisions of section 160 of this Act.

164.	Re-issue of shares acquired

Where shares in a company are redeemed, purchased, acquired or forfeited, such shares shall, unless the company by alteration of its articles of association cancels the shares, be available for re-issue by the company.

165.	Acquisition of shares of holding company

(1)	A company which is a subsidiary may acquire shares in its holding company where the subsidiary company is concerned as personal representative or trustee, unless the holding company or any subsidiary of it is beneficially interested otherwise than by way of security for the purposes of a transaction entered into by it in the ordinary course of a business which includes the lending of money.

(2)	A subsidiary which is, at the commencement of this Act, a holder of shares of its holding company or a subsidiary which acquired shares in its holding company before it became a subsidiary of that holding company, may continue to hold such shares but, subject to subsection (1) of this section, shall have no right to vote at meetings of the holding company or any class of shareholders of the holding company and shall not acquire any future shares in it except on a capitalisation issue.

PART VII

Debentures

Creation of debenture and debenture stock

166.	Power to borrow money, to charge property and to issue debentures

A company may borrow money for the purpose of its business or objects and may mortgage or charge its undertaking, property and uncalled capital, or any part thereof, and issue debentures, debenture stock and other securities whether outright or as security for any debt, liability or obligation of the company or of any third party.

167.	Documents of title to debentures or certificate of debenture stock

(1)	Every company shall, within sixty days after the allotment of any of its debentures or after the registration of the transfer of any debentures, deliver to the registered holder thereof, the debenture or a certificate of the debenture stock under the common seal of the company.

(2)	If a debenture or debenture stock certificate is defaced, lost or destroyed, the company, at the request of the registered holder of the debenture, shall issue a certified copy of the debenture or renew the debenture stock certificate on payment of a fee not exceeding N5 and on such terms as to evidence and indemnity and the payment of the company’s out-of-pocket expenses of investigating evidence, as the company may reasonably require.

(3)	If default is made in complying with this section, the company and any officer of the company who is in default, shall be liable to a fine not exceeding N25, and on application by any person entitled to have the debentures or debenture stock certificate delivered to him, the court may order the company to deliver the debenture or debenture stock certificate and may require the company and any such officer to bear all the costs of and incidental to the application.

168.	Statements to be included in debentures

Every debenture shall include a statement on the following matters, that is—

(a)	the principal amount borrowed;

(b)	the maximum discount which may be allowed on the issue or re-issue of the debentures, and the maximum premium at which the debentures may be made redeemable;

(c)	the rate of and the dates on which interest on the debentures issued shall be paid and the manner in which payment shall be made;

(d)	the date on which the principal amount shall be repaid or the manner in which redemption shall be effected, whether by the payment of instalments of principal or otherwise;

(e)     in the case of convertible debentures, the date and terms on which the debentures may be converted into shares and the amounts which may be credited as paid up on those shares, and the dates and terms on which the holders may exercise any right to subscribe for shares in re-spect of the debentures held by them;

(f)       the charges securing the debenture and the conditions subject to which the debenture shall take effect.

169.	Effect of statements in debentures

(1)	Statements made in debenture or debenture stock certificates shall be prima facie evidence of the title to the debentures of the person named therein as the registered holder and of the amounts secured thereby.

(2)	If any person shall change his position to his detriment in reliance in good faith on the continued accuracy of any statements made in the debenture or debenture stock certificate, the company shall be estopped in favour of such person from denying the continued accuracy of such statements and shall compensate such person for any loss suffered by him in reliance thereon and which he would not have suffered had the statement been or continued to be accurate:

Provided that nothing in this subsection shall derogate from any right the company may have to be indemnified by any other person.

170.	Enforcement of contracts relating to debentures

A contract with a company to take up and pay for any debentures of the company may be enforced by an order for specific performance.

Types of debentures

171.	Perpetual debentures

A company may issue perpetual debentures, and a condition contained in any debentures, or in any deed for securing any debentures, shall not be invalid by reason only that the debentures are made irre-deemable or redeemable only on the happening of a contingency, however remote, or on the expiration of a period, however long, notwithstanding any rule of equity to the contrary.

172.	Convertible debentures

Debentures may be issued upon the terms that in lieu of redemption or repayment, they may, at the option of the holder or the company, be converted into shares in the company upon such terms as may be stated in the debentures.

173.	Secured or naked debentures

(1)	Debentures may either be secured by a charge over the company’s property or may be unsecured by any charge.

(2)	Debentures may be secured by a fixed charge on certain of the company’s property or a floating charge over the whole or a specified part of the company’s undertaking and assets, or by both a fixed charge on certain property and a floating charge.

(3)	A charge securing debentures shall become enforceable on the occurrence of the events specified in the debentures or the deed securing the same.

(4)	Where any legal proceedings are brought by a debenture holder to enforce the security of a series of debentures of which he holds part, the debenture holder shall sue in a representative capacity on behalf of himself and all other debenture holders of that series.

174.	Redeemable debentures

A company limited by shares may issue debentures which are, or at the option of the company are to be liable, to be redeemed.

175.	Power to re-issue redeemed debentures in certain cases

(1)	Where either before or after the commencement of this Act, a company has redeemed any de-bentures previously issued, then unless—

(a)	any provision, express or implied, to the contrary is contained in the articles or in any contract entered into by the company; or

(b)	the company has, by passing a resolution to that effect or by some other act, manifested its intention that the debentures shall be cancelled, the company shall have, and shall be deemed always to have had, power to re-issue the debentures, either by re-issuing the same debentures or by issuing other debentures in their place.

(2)	On a re-issue of redeemed debentures, the person entitled to the debentures, shall have, and shall be deemed always to have had, the same priorities as if the debentures had never been redeemed.

(3)	Where a company has, either before or after the commencement of this Act, deposited any of its debentures to secure advances, from time-to-time, on current account or otherwise, the debenture shall not be deemed to have been redeemed by reason only of the account of the company having ceased to be in debit, whilst the debentures remained so deposited.

(4)	The re-issue of a debenture or the issue of another debenture in its place under the power given by this section to or deemed to have been possessed by a company, whether the re-issue or issue was made before or after the commencement of this Act, shall be treated as the issue of a new debenture for the purposes of a stamp duty, but it shall not be so treated for the purposes of any provision limiting the amount or number of debentures to be issued:

Provided that any person lending money on the security of a debenture re-issued under this section which appears to be duly stamped, may give the debenture in evidence in any proceedings for enforcing his security without payment of the stamp duty or any penalty in respect thereof, unless he had notice or, but for his negligence, might have discovered, that the debenture was not duly stamped, but in any such case the company shall be liable to pay the proper stamp duty and penalty.

(5)	Nothing in this section shall prejudice any power to issue debentures in place of any debentures paid off or otherwise satisfied or extinguished which, by its debentures or the securities for the same, is reserved to a company.

176.	Rights of debenture holders

(1)	The trustee of a debenture trust deed shall hold all contracts, stipulations and undertakings given to him and all mortgages, charges and securities vested in him in connection with the debentures covered by the deed, or some of those debentures, exclusively for the benefit of the debenture holders concerned (except in so far as the deed otherwise provides) and the trustee shall exercise due diligence in respect of the enforcement of those contracts, stipulations, undertakings, mortgages, charges and securities and the fulfilment of his functions generally.

(2)	A debenture holder may sue—

(a) the company which issued the debentures he holds for payment of any amount payable to him in respect of the debentures; or 

(b) the trustee of the debenture trust deed covering the debentures he holds for compensation for any breach of the duties which the trustee owes him, and in any such action, it shall not be necessary for any other debenture holders of the same class, or if the action is brought against the company, the trustee of the covering trust deed, to be joined as a party.

(3)	This section shall apply notwithstanding anything contained in a debenture or trust deed or other instrument, but a provision in a debenture or trust deed shall be valid and binding on all the debenture holders of the class concerned in so far as it enables a meeting of the debenture holders by a resolution supported by the votes of the holders of at least three quarters in value of the debentures of that class in respect of which votes are cast on the resolution to—

(a)	release any trustee from liability for any breach of his duties to the debenture holders which he has already committed, or generally from liability for all such breaches (without necessarily specifying them) upon his ceasing to be trustee;

(b)	consent to the alteration or abrogation of any of the rights, powers or remedies of the debenture holders and the trustee of the debenture trust deed covering their debentures (except the powers and remedies under section 209 of this Act); or

(c)	consent to the substitution for the debentures of a different class issued by the company or any other company or corporation, or the cancellation of the debentures in consideration of the issue to the debenture holders of shares credited as fully paid in the company or any other company.

177.	Meetings of debenture holders

(1)	The terms of any debentures or trust deed may provide for the convening of general meetings of the debenture holders and for the passing, at such meetings, of a resolution binding on all the holders of the debentures of the same class.

(2)	Whether or not the debentures or trust deed contain such provisions as are referred to in subsec-tion (1) of this section, the Commission may at any time direct a meeting of the debenture holders of any class to be held and conducted in such manner as the Commission thinks fit to consider ancillary or consequential direction as it shall think fit.

(3)	Notwithstanding anything contained in a debenture trust deed, or in any debenture or contract or instrument, the trustee of a debenture deed shall, on the requisition of persons holding, at the date of the deposit of the acquisition debentures covered by the trust deed which carry not less than one tenth of the total voting rights attached to all the issued and outstanding debentures of that class, forthwith, proceed duly to convene a meeting of that class of debenture holders.

Fixed and floating charges

178.	Meaning of 'floating' and 'fixed' charges

(1)	A 'floating charge' means an equitable charge over the whole or a specified part of the company’s undertakings and assets, including cash and uncalled capital of the company both present and future, but so that the charge shall not preclude the company from dealing with such assets until—

(a)       the security becomes enforceable and the holder thereof, pursuant to a power in that behalf in the debenture or the deed securing the same, appoints a receiver or manager or enters into possession of such assets; or

(b)	the court appoints a receiver or manager of such assets on the application of the holder; or

(c)	the company goes into liquidation.

(2)	On the happening of any of the events mentioned in subsection (1) of this section, the charge shall be deemed to crystallise and to become a fixed equitable charge on such of the company’s assets as are subject to the charge, and if a receiver or manager is withdrawn with the consent of the chargee, or the chargee withdraws from possession before the charge has been fully discharged, the charge shall thereupon be deemed to cease to be a fixed charge and again to become a floating charge.

179.	Priority of fixed over floating charge

A fixed charge on any property shall have priority over a floating charge affecting that property, unless the terms on which the floating charge was granted prohibited the company from granting any later charge having priority over the floating charge and the person in whose favour such later charge was granted had actual notice of that prohibition at the time when the charge was granted to him.

180.	Powers of the court

(1)	Whenever a fixed or floating charge has become enforceable, the court shall have power to appoint a receiver and in the case of a floating charge, a receiver and manager of the assets subject to the charge.

(2)	In the case of a floating charge, the court may, notwithstanding that the charge has not become enforceable, appoint a receiver or manager if satisfied that the security of the debenture holder is in jeopardy; and the security of the debenture holder shall be deemed to be in jeopardy if the court is satisfied that events have occurred or are about to occur which render it unreasonable in the interests of the debenture holder that the company should retain power to dispose of its assets.

(3)	A receiver or manager shall not be appointed as a means of enforcing debentures not secured by any charge.

181.	Advertisement of appointment of receiver and manager

Where a receiver or a receiver and manager is appointed by the court, advertisement to this effect shall be made by the receiver or the receiver and manager in the Gazette and in two daily newspapers.

182.	Preferential payment to debenture holders in certain cases

(1)	Where a receiver is appointed on behalf of the holders of any debentures of a registered company secured by a floating charge, or possession is taken by, or on behalf of those debenture holders of any property comprising or subject to the charge, then if the company is not at the time in course of being wound up, the debts which in every winding-up are under the provisions relating to preferential payments in Part XV of this Act to be paid in priority to all other debts, shall be paid out of any assets coming to the hands of the receiver or other person taking possession as aforesaid in priority to any claim for principal or interest in respect of the debentures.

(2)	In the application of the provisions relating to preferential payments—

(a) section 494 of this Act shall be construed as if the provision for payment of accrued holiday remuneration becoming payable on the termination of employment before or by the effect of the winding-up order or resolution, were a provision for payment of such remuneration becoming payable on the termination of employment before or by the effect of appointment of the receiver or possession being taken as aforesaid; and

(b) the periods of time mentioned therein shall be reckoned from the date of the appointment of the receiver or of possession being taken as aforesaid, as the case may be, and if such date occurred before the commencement of this Act, the provisions relating to preferential payments which would have applied but for this Act, shall be deemed to remain in full force.

(3)	Any payments made under this section, shall be recouped as far as may be out of the assets of the company available for payment of general creditors.

Debenture trust deed

183.	Execution of debenture trust deed

(1)	Every company which offers debentures to the public for subscription or purchase shall, before issuing any of the debentures, execute a debenture trust deed in respect of them and procure the execution of the deed by the trustee for the debenture holders appointed by the deed.

(2)	No debenture trust deed shall cover more than one class of debentures, whether or not the trust deed is required by this section to be executed.

(3)	Where a trust deed is required to be executed by this section but has not been executed, the court, on the application of a debenture holder concerned, may—

(a)      order the company to execute a trust deed;

(b)	direct that a person nominated by the court shall be appointed to be trustee; and

(c)	give such consequential directions as it thinks fit, as to the contents of the trust deed and its execution by the trustee thereof.

(4)	For the purposes of this Act, debentures shall belong to different classes if different rights attach to them in respect of—

(a)	the rate of, or dates for payment of interest;

(b)	the dates when, or the instalments by which, the principal of the debenture shall be repaid, unless the difference is solely that the class of debentures shall be repaid during a stated period of time and particular debentures may be repaid at different dates during that period according to selections made by the company or by drawings, ballot or otherwise;

(c)	any right to subscribe for or convert the debentures into shares in, or other debentures of, the company or any other company; or

(d)	the powers of the debenture holders to realise any security.

(5)	Debentures further belong to different classes, if they do not rank equally for payment when any security invested in the debenture holders under any trust deed is realised or when the company is wound up, that is to say, if, in the circumstances mentioned in subsection (4) of this section the subject- matter of any such security or the proceeds thereof, or any assets available to satisfy the debentures, is or are not to be applied in satisfying the debentures strictly in proportion to the amount of principal, premiums and arrears of interest to which the holders of them are respectively entitled.

(6)	A debenture is covered by a trust deed if—

(a)	the holder of the debenture is entitled to participate in any money payable by the company under the deed; or

(b)	is entitled to the benefit of any mortgage, charge or security created by the deed, whether alone or together with other persons.

(7)	If a company issues debentures in circumstances in which this section requires a debenture trust deed to be executed, without such a deed having been executed in compliance with this section, or if the company issues debentures under a trust deed which covers two or more classes of debentures, the di-rectors of the company who are in default are guilty of an offence and liable on conviction to a fine of N5,000 jointly or severally.

184.	Contents of debenture trust deed

(1)	Every debenture trust deed, whether required by section 183 of this Act or not, shall state—

(a)	the maximum sum which the company may raise by issuing debentures of the same class;

(b)	the maximum discount which may be allowed on the issue or re-issue of the debentures, and the maximum premium at which the debentures may be made redeemable;

(c)	the nature of any assets over which a mortgage, charge or security is created by the trust deed in favour of the trustee for the benefit of the debenture holders equally, and except where such a charge is a floating charge or a general floating charge, the identity of the assets subject to it;

(d)       the nature of any assets over which a mortgage, charge or security has been or will be created in favour of any person other than the trustee for the benefit of the debenture holders equally, and except where such a charge is a floating charge or a general floating charge, the identity of the assets subject to it;

(e)       whether the company has created or will create any mortgage, charge or security for the benefit of some, but not all, of the holders of debentures issued under the trust deed;

(f)	any prohibition or restriction on the power of the company to issue debentures or to create mortgages, charges or any security on any of its assets ranking in priority to, or equally with the debentures issued under the trust deed;

(g)	whether the company shall have power to acquire debentures issued under the trust deed before the date of their redemption and to re-issue the debentures;

(h)	the rate of and the dates on which interest on the debentures issued under the trust deed shall be paid and the manner in which payment may be made;

(i)	 the date or dates on which the principal or the debentures issued under the trust deed shall be repaid, and unless the whole principal is to be repaid to all the debenture holders at the same time, the manner in which redemption shall be effected, whether by the payment of equal in-stalments of principal in respect of each debenture, or by the selection of debentures for re-demption by the company, or by drawing, ballot, or otherwise;

(j)      in the case of convertible debentures, the dates and terms on which the debentures may be converted into shares and the amounts which may be credited as paid up on those shares in right of the debentures held by them;

(k)      the circumstances in which the debenture holders shall be entitled to realise any mortgage, charge or security invested in the trustee or any other person for their benefit (other than the circumstances in which they are entitled to do so by this Act);

(l)       the powers of the company and the trustee to call meetings of the debenture holders and the rights of debenture holders to require the company or the trustee to call such meetings;

(m)	whether the rights of debenture holders may be altered or abrogated and if so, the conditions which must be fulfilled, and the procedure which must be followed, to effect such an alteration or abrogation; and

(2)	The appointment of an inspector under this section may define the scope of his investigation, whether as respects the matter or the period to which it is to extend or otherwise, and in particular may limit investigation to matters connected with particular shares or debentures.

(3)	Where an application for an investigation under this section with respect to particular shares or debentures of a company is made to the Commission by members of the company, and the number of applicants or the amount of the shares held by them is not less than that required for an application for the appointment of an inspector under sections 314 (2) (a) and (b) of this Act—

329.	Power to impose restrictions on shares, etc.

(1)	Where, in connection with an investigation under section 326 or 328 of this Act, it appears to the Commission that there is difficulty in finding out the relevant facts about any share (whether issued or to be issued), and that the difficulty is due wholly or mainly to the unwillingness of the persons concerned, or any of them, to assist the investigation as required by this Act, the Commission may in writing direct that the shares shall until further notice be subject to the restrictions imposed by this section.

(5)	Any person who—

(a)      exercises or purports to exercise any right to dispose of any shares which, to his knowledge, are for the time being subject to restrictions under this section; or

(b)	votes in respect of any such shares, whether as holder or proxy, or appoints a proxy to vote in respect thereof; or

A petition for the continuance of a voluntary winding-up subject to the supervision of the court shall, for the purpose of giving jurisdiction to the court over actions, be deemed to be a petition for winding-up by the court.

488.	Application of sections 413 and 414

A winding-up subject to the supervision of the court shall, for the purposes of sections 413 and 414 of this Act, be deemed to be a winding-up by the court. 

489.	Power of court to appoint, etc., liquidators

(1)	Where an order is made for a winding-up subject to supervision, the court may by the same or any subsequent order appoint an additional liquidator.

(2)	A liquidator appointed by the court under this section shall have the same powers, be subject to the same obligations, and in all respects stand in the same position, as if he had been duly appointed in accordance with the provisions of this Act with respect to the appointment of liquidators in a voluntary winding-up.

(3)	The court may remove any liquidator so appointed by the court or any liquidator continued under the supervision order, and may fill any vacancy occasioned by the removal, or by death or resignation.

490.	Effect of supervision order

(1)	Where an order is made for a winding-up subject to supervision, the liquidator may, subject to any restrictions imposed by the court, exercise all his powers, without the sanction or intervention of the court, in the same manner as if the company were being wound up voluntarily:

Provided that the powers specified in sections 425 (1) (d), (e) and (f) of this Act shall not be ex-ercised by the liquidator except with the sanction of the court or, in a case where before the order the winding-up was a creditors’ voluntary winding-up, with the sanction of the court or the committee of inspection, or (if there is no such committee) a meeting of the creditors.

(2)	A winding-up subject to the supervision of the court shall not amount to a win ding-up by the court for the purpose of the provisions of this Act as specified in the Twelfth Schedule to this Act (dealing with provisions which do not apply in the case of winding-up subject to the supervision of the court) but, subject to this, an order for a winding-up subject to supervision shall for all purposes be an order for winding-up by the court:

Provided that where the order for winding-up subject to supervision of the committee was made in relation to a creditors’ voluntary winding-up in which a committee of inspection had been appointed, the order shall be deemed to be an order for winding-up by the court for the purposes of section 434 of this Act, (except subsection (1) thereof) save insofar as the operation of that section is excluded in a voluntary winding-up by general rules made under this Act.

[Twelfth Schedule.]

[Cap. W6.]

(2)	Where any compensation under the Workmen’s Compensation Act is a weekly payment, the amount due in respect thereof shall, for the purpose of subsection (1) (e) of this section, be taken to be the amount of the lump sum for which the weekly payment could, if redeemable, be redeemed if the employer made an application for that purpose under the aforesaid Act.

[Cap. W6.]

(3)	Where any payment on account of wages or salary has been made to any clerk, servant, workman or labourer in the employment of a company out of the money advanced by some persons for that purpose, that person shall in a winding-up have a right of priority in respect of the money so advanced and paid up to the amount by which the sum in respect of which that clerk, servant, workman or labourer would have been entitled to priority in the winding-up has been diminished by reason of the payment having been made.

Effect of winding-up on antecedent and other transactions

495.	Fraudulent preference

(1)	Any conveyance, mortgage, delivery of goods, payment, execution or other act relating to prop-erty which would, if made or done by or against an individual, be deemed in his bankruptcy a fraudulent preference, shall, if made or done by or against a company, be deemed, in the event of its being wound up, a fraudulent preference of its creditors, and be invalid accordingly.

(2)	Any conveyance or assignment by a company of all its property to trustees for the benefit of all its creditors shall be void.

(3)	For the purposes of this section, the presentation of a petition for winding-up in the case of a winding-up by or subject to the supervision of the court, and a resolution for winding-up in the case of a voluntary winding-up, shall be deemed to correspond with the act of bankruptcy in the case of an individual.

496.	Liabilities and rights of certain fraudulently preferred persons

(1)	Where anything made or done after the commencement of this Act is void under section 495 of this Act as a fraudulent preference of a person interested in property mortgaged or charged to secure the company’s debt, the person preferred shall, without prejudice to any liabilities or rights arising apart from this provision, be subject to the same liabilities and have the same rights, as if he had undertaken to be personally liable as surety for the debt, to the extent of the charge on the property or have value of his in-terest, whichever is the less, and the value of the said person’s interest shall be determined as at the date of the transaction constituting the fraudulent preference, and shall be determined as if the interest were free of all encumbrances other than those to which the charge for the company’s debt was the subject.

(2)	Where for the purposes of this section, application is made to the court with respect to any payment on the ground that the payment was fraudulent preference of a surety or guarantor, the court shall have jurisdiction to determine any questions with respect to the payment arising between the person to whom the payment was made and the surety or guarantor and to grant relief in respect thereof, notwithstanding that it is not necessary to do so for the purposes of the winding-up, and for that purpose may give leave to bring in the surety or guarantor as a third party as in the case of an action for the re-covery of the sum paid.

(3)	Subsection (2) of this section shall apply, with the necessary modifications, in relation to trans-actions other than the payment of money, as it applies in relation to payments.

497.	Avoidance of attachments, etc., on winding-up subject to supervision of the court

Where a company is being wound up subject to the supervision of the court, any attachment, se-questration or execution put in force against the estate or effects of the company after the commencement of the winding-up, shall be void.

498.	Effect of floating charge

Where a company is being wound up, a floating charge on the undertaking or property of the company created within three months of the commencement of the winding-up shall, unless it is proved that the company immediately after the creation of the charge was solvent, be invalid, except to the amount of any cash paid to the company at the time of or subsequently to the creation of and in consideration for, the charge, together with interest on that amount at the current bank rate.

499.	Disclaimer of onerous property

(1)	Where any part of the property of a company which is being wound up consists of land of any tenure burdened with onerous covenants, of shares or stock in companies, of unprofitable contracts, or of any other property that is unsaleable, or not readily saleable, by reason of its binding the possessor thereof to the performance of any onerous act or to the payment of any sum of money, the liquidator of the company, notwithstanding that he has endeavoured to sell or has taken possession of the property or exercised any act of ownership in relation thereto, may, with the leave of the court, and subject to the provisions of this section, by writing signed by him, at any time within twelve months after the com-mencement of the winding-up or such extended period as may be allowed by the court, disclaim the property:

Provided that, where any such property has not come to the knowledge of the liquidator within one month after the commencement of the winding-up, the power under this section of disclaiming the property may be exercised at any time within twelve months after he has become aware thereof or such extended period as may be allowed by the court.

(2)	A disclaimer under this section shall operate to determine, as from the date of the disclaimer, the rights, interest and liabilities of the company, and the property of the company, in or in respect of the property disclaimed, but shall not, except so far as is necessary for the purpose of releasing the company and the property of the company from liability, affect the rights or liabilities of any other person.

(3)	The court, before or on granting leave to disclaim, may require such notices to be given to persons interested, and impose such terms as a condition of granting leave, and make such other order in the matter as the court thinks just.

(4)	The liquidator shall not be entitled to disclaim any property under this section in any case where an application in writing has been made to him by any persons interested in the property requiring him to decide whether or not he will disclaim and the liquidator has not, within a period of twenty-eight days after the receipt of the application or such further period as may be allowed by the court, given notice to the applicant that he intends to apply to the court for leave to disclaim and, in the case of a contract, if the liquidator, after such an application, does not within that period or further period disclaim the contract, the company shall be deemed to have adopted it.

(5)	The court may, on the application of any person who is, as against the liquidator, entitled to the benefit or subject to the burden of a contract on such terms as to payment by or to either party, of damages for the non-performance of the contract, or otherwise as the court thinks just and any damages payable under the order to any such person may be proved by him as a debt in the winding-up.

(6)	The court may, on an application by any person who claims any interest in any property disclaimed under this section, or is under any liability not discharged by this Act in respect of any disclaimed property and on hearing any such persons as it thinks fit, make an order for the vesting of the property in or the delivery of the property to any persons entitled thereto, or to whom it may seem just that the property should be delivered by way of compensation for such liability as aforesaid, or a trustee for him and on such terms as the court thinks just and on any such vesting order being made, the property comprised therein shall vest accordingly in the person therein named in that behalf without any conveyance or assignment for the purpose.

(7)	Where the property disclaimed is of a leasehold nature the court shall not make a vesting order in favour of any person claiming under the company, whether as an under-lessee or as a mortgagee by demise, a mortgage by way of legal charge or mortgage, as the case may be, except upon the terms of making that person—

(a)	subject to the same liabilities and obligations as those to which the company was subject under the lease in respect of the property at the commencement of the winding-up; or

(b)	if the court thinks fit, subject only to the same liabilities and obligations as if the lease had been assigned to that person at that date,

and in either event if the case so requires, as if the lease had comprised only the property comprised in the vesting order and any mortgagee or under-lessee declining to accept a vesting order upon such terms shall be excluded from all interest in and security upon the property and if there is no person claiming under the company who is willing to accept an order upon such terms, the court shall have power to vest the estate and interest of the company in the property in any person liable, either personally or in a representative character, and either alone or jointly with the company, to perform the lessee’s covenants in the lease, freed and discharged from all estates, encumbrances and interests created therein by the company.

(8)	Any person injured by the operation of a disclaimer under this section shall be deemed to be a creditor of the company to the amount of the injury, and may accordingly prove the amount as a debt in the winding-up.

500.	Restriction of rights of creditor as to execution, etc., on winding-up of company

(1) Where a creditor issues execution against any goods or land of a company, or attaches any debt due to the company and the company is subsequently wound up, the creditor shall not be entitled to retain the benefit of the execution or attachment against the liquidator in the winding-up of the company, unless he has completed the execution or attachment before the commencement of the winding- up:

Provided that—

(a)	where any creditor has had notice of a meeting having been called at which a resolution for voluntary winding-up is to be proposed, the date on which the creditor so had notice shall, for the purposes of the foregoing provision, be substituted for the date of the commencement of the winding-up;

(b)	if a person purchases in good faith under a sale by the sheriff any goods of a company on which an execution has been levied, he shall acquire a good title to them against the liquidator;

(c)	the rights conferred by this subsection on the liquidator may be set aside by the court in favour of the creditor to such extent and subject to such terms as the court thinks fit.

(2)	For the purposes of this section, an execution against goods shall be taken to be completed by seizure and sale and an attachment of a debt shall be deemed to be completed by receipt of the debt, and an execution against land shall be deemed to be completed by seizure and, in the case of an equitable interest, by the appointment of a receiver.

501.	Duty of sheriff as to goods taken in execution

(1)	Subject to the provisions of subsection (3) of this section, where any goods of a company are taken in execution and before the sale thereof or the completion of the execution by the receipt or recovery of the full amount of the levy, notice is served on the sheriff that a provisional liquidator has been appointed or that a winding-up order has been made or that a resolution for voluntary winding-up has been passed, the sheriff shall, on being so required, deliver the goods and any money seized or received in part satisfaction of the execution to the liquidator, but the costs of the execution shall be a first charge on the goods or money so delivered and the liquidator may sell the goods, or a sufficient part thereof, for the purpose of satisfying that charge.

(2)	Subject to the provisions of subsection (3) of this section, where under an execution in respect of a judgment for a sum exceeding N100 the goods of a company are sold or money is paid in order to avoid the sale, the sheriff shall deduct the costs of the execution from the proceeds of the sale or the money paid, and retain the balance for fourteen days and if within that time notice is served on him of a petition for the winding-up of the company having been presented or of a meeting having been called at which there is to be proposed a resolution for the voluntary winding-up of the company and an order is made or a resolution is passed, as the case may be, for the winding-up of the company, the sheriff shall pay the balance to the liquidator, who shall be entitled to retain it as against the execution creditor.

(3)	The rights conferred by this section on the liquidator may be set aside by the court in favour of the creditor to such extent and subject to such terms as the court thinks fit.

(4)	In this section and section 500 of this Act—

(a)	'goods' includes chattels personal; and

(b)	'sheriff’ includes any officer charged with the execution of a writ or other process.

PART II

Accounting principles and rules

SECTION A

Accounting Principles

Preliminary

14.	Subject to paragraph 15, the amounts to be included in respect of all items shown in a company’s financial statements shall be determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and with the accounting standards laid down from time-to-time by the Nigerian Accounting Standards Board.

Departure from the accounting principles

15.	If it appears to the directors of a company that there are special reasons for departing from any of the principles stated above in preparing the company’s financial statements in respect of any financial year they may do so, but particulars of the departure, the reasons for it and its effect shall be given in a note to the accounts. 

SECTION B

Historical cost accounting rules

Preliminary

16.	Subject to section C of this Part of this Schedule, the amounts to be included in respect of all items shown in a company’s financial statements shall be determined in accordance with the rules set out in paragraphs 17 to 28.

Fixed assets

17.	Subject to any provision for depreciation or diminution in value made in accordance with paragraph 18 or 19, the amount to be included in respect of any fixed asset shall be its purchase price or production cost.

18.	In the case of any fixed asset which has a limited useful economic life, the amount of—

(a)	its purchase price or production cost; or

(b)	where it is estimated that any such assets will have a residual value at the end of the period of its useful economic life, its purchase price or production cost less that estimated residual value,

shall be reduced by provisions for depreciation calculated to write off that amount systematically over the period of the asset’s useful economic life.

19.	(1) Where a fixed asset investment of a description falling to be included under item B III of either the balance sheet formats set out in Part I of this Schedule had diminished in value, provisions for diminution in value may be made in respect of it and the amount to be included in respect of it may be reduced accordingly, and any such provisions which are not shown in the profit and loss account shall be disclosed (either separately or in aggregate) in a note to the accounts.

(2)	Provisions for diminution in value shall be made in respect of any fixed asset which had diminished in value if the reduction in its value is expected to be permanent (whether it’s useful economic life is limited or not), and the amount to be included in respect of it shall be reduced accordingly, and any such provisions which are not shown in the profit and loss account, shall be disclosed (either separately or in aggregate) in a note to the accounts.

(3)	Where the reasons for which any provision was made in accordance with sub-paragraph (1) or (2) have ceased to apply to any extent, that provision shall be written back to the extent that it is no longer necessary, and any amounts written back in accordance with this sub-paragraph which are not shown in the profit and loss account, shall be disclosed (either separately or in aggregate) in a note to the accounts.

Rules for determining particular fixed asset items

20.	(1) Notwithstanding that an item in respect of 'development costs' is included under 'fixed assets' in the balance sheet formats set out in Part I of this Schedule, an amount may only be included in a company’s balance sheet in respect of development costs in special circumstances.

(2)	If any amount is included in a company’s balance sheet in respect of development costs the following information shall be given in a note to the accounts—

(a)	the period over which the amount of those costs originally capitalised is being or is to be written off; and

(b)	the reason for capitalising the development costs in question.

21.	(1) The application of paragraphs 17 to 19 in relation to goodwill (in any case where goodwill is treated as an asset) is subject to the following provisions of this paragraph.

(2)	The amount of the consideration for goodwill acquired by a company shall be reduced by provision for amortisation calculated to write off that amount systematically over a period of five years or less as may be determined by the directors of the company.

(3)	In any case where any goodwill acquired by a company is shown or included as an asset in the company’s balance sheet, the period chosen for writing off the consideration for that goodwill and the rea-sons for choosing that period shall be disclosed in a note to the accounts.

Current assets

22.	Subject to paragraph 23, the amount to be included in respect of any current asset shall be its purchase price or production cost.

23.	(1) If the net realisable value of any current asset is lower than its purchase price or production cost, the amount to be included in respect of that asset shall be the net realisable value.

(2) Where the reasons for which any provision for diminution in value was made in accordance with sub-paragraph (1) have ceased to apply to any extent, that provision shall be written back to the extent that it is no longer necessary.

Miscellaneous and supplementary provision

Excess of money owed over value received as an asset item

24.	(1) Where the amount repayable on any debt owed by a company is greater than the value of the consideration received in the transaction giving rise to the debt, the amount of the difference may be treated as an asset.

(2) Where any such amount is so treated—

(a)	it shall be written off reasonable amounts each year and must be completely written off before repayment of the debt; and

(b)	if the current amount is not shown as a separate item in the company’s balance sheet it must be disclosed in a note to the accounts.

Assets included at a fixed amount

25.	(1) Subject to the following sub-paragraph assets which fall to be included—

(a)	amongst the fixed assets of a company under the item 'tangible assets”; or

(b)	amongst the current assets of a company under the item 'raw material and consumables”, may be included at a fixed quantity and value.

(2) Sub-paragraph (1) applies to assets of a kind which are constantly being replaced, where—

(a)	their overall value is not material to assessing the company’s state of affairs; and

(b)	their quantity, value and composition are not subject to material variation.

Determination of purchase price or production cost

26.	(1) The purchase price of an asset shall be determined by adding to the actual price paid any expenses incidental to its acquisition.

(2)	The production cost of an asset shall be determined by adding to the purchase price of the raw materials and consumables used the amount of the costs incurred by the company which are directly attributable to the production of that asset.

(3)	In addition, there may be included in the production cost of an asset—

(a)	a reasonable proportion of the costs incurred by the company which are only indirectly attributable to the production of that asset, but only to the extent that they relate to the period of production; and

(b)	interest on capital borrowed to finance the production of that asset, to the extent that it accrues in respect of the period of production:

Provided, however, in a case within paragraph (b) above, that the inclusion of the interest in determining the cost of that asset and the amount of the interest so included is disclosed in a note to the accounts.

(4)	In the case of current assets distribution costs may not be included in production costs.

27.	(1) Subject to the qualification mentioned below, the purchase price or production cost of—

(a)any assets which fall to be included under any item shown in a company’s balance sheet under the general item 'stocks”; and

(b) any assets which are tangible assets (including investments),

may be determined by the application of any of the methods mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) below in rela-tion to any such assets of the same class.

The method chosen must be one which appears to the directors to be appropriate in the circumstances of the company.

(2)	Those methods are—

(a)	the method known as 'first in, first out' (FIFO);

(b)	the method known as 'last in, first out' (LIFO);

(c)	a weighted average price; and

(d)	any other method similar to any of the methods mentioned above.

(3)	Where in the case of any company—

(a) the purchase price or production cost of assets falling to be included under any item shown in the company’s balance sheet has been determined by the application of any method permitted by this paragraph; and

(b) the amount shown in respect of that item differs materially from the relevant alternative amount given below in this paragraph,

the amount of the difference shall be disclosed in a note to the accounts.

(4)	Subject to sub-paragraph (5) below, for the purposes of sub-paragraph (3) (b) above, the relevant alternative amount, in relation to any item shown in a company’s balance sheet, is the amount which would have been shown in respect of that item if assets of any class included under that item at an amount determined by any method permitted by this paragraph had instead been included at their replacement cost as at the balance sheet date.

(5)	The relevant alternative amount may be determined by reference to the most recent actual purchase price or production cost before the balance sheet date of the assets of any class included under the item in question instead of by reference to their replacement cost as at that date, but only if the former appears to the directors of the company to constitute the more appropriate standard of comparison in the case of assets of that class.

(6)	For the purposes of this paragraph, assets of any description shall be regarded as tangible if assets of that description are substantially indistinguishable one from another.

Substitution of original stated amount where price or cost unknown

28.	Where there is no record of the purchase price or production cost of any assets of a company or of any price, expenses or costs relevant for determining its purchase price or production cost in accordance with paragraph 26, or any such record cannot be obtained without unreasonable expense or delay, its purchase price or production cost shall be taken for the purposes of paragraph 17 to 23 to be the value record of its value made on or after its acquisition or production by the company.

SECTION C

Alternative accounting rules

Preliminary

29.	(1) The rules set out in section B are referred to below in this Schedule as the historical cost accounting rules.

(2) Those rules, with the omission of paragraphs 16, 21 and 25 to 28, are referred to below in this Part of this Schedule as the depreciation rules, and references below in this Schedule to the historical cost ac-counting rules do not include the depreciation rules as they apply by virtue of paragraph 32.

30.	Subject to paragraphs 32 to 34, the amount to be included in respect of assets of any description mentioned in paragraph 26 may be determined on any basis so mentioned.

Alternative accounting rules

31.	(1) Intangible fixed assets, other than goodwill, may be included at their current cost.

(2)	Tangible fixed assets may be included at a market value determined as at the date of their valuation or at their current cost.

(3)	Investments of any description failing to be included under item B III of either of the balance sheet formats set out in Part I of this Schedule may be included either—

(a)	at a market value determined as at the date of their last valuation; or

(b)	at a value determined on any basis which appears to the directors to be appropriate in the circumstances of the company,

but in the latter case particulars of the method of valuation adopted and of the reasons for adopting it shall be disclosed in a note to the accounts.

(4)	Investments of any description falling to be included under item C III of either of the balance sheet formats set out in Part I of this Schedule may be included at their current cost.

(5)	Stocks may be included at their current cost.

(EDITORIAL NOTE: Wording as per Gazette.)

Application of the depreciation rules

32.	(1) Where the value of any assets of a company is determined on any basis mentioned in paragraph 31, that value shall be, or (as the case may require) be the starting point for determining, the amount to be included in respect of that asset in the company’s accounts, instead of its purchase price or production cost or any value previously so determined for that asset, and the depreciation rules shall apply accordingly in relation to any such asset with the substitution for any reference to its purchase price or production cost of a reference to the value most recently determined for that asset on any basis mentioned in paragraph 31.

(2)	The amount of any provision for depreciation required in the case of any fixed asset by para-graph 18 or 19 as it applies by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) is referred to below in this paragraph as the ad-justed amount, and the amount of any provision which would be required by that paragraph in the case of that asset according to the historical cost accounting rules, is referred to as the historical cost amount.

(3)	Where sub-paragraph (1) applies in the case of any fixed asset, the amount of any provision for depreciation in respect of that asset—

(a)included in any item shown in the profit and loss account in respect of amounts written off assets of the description in question; or

(b) taken into account in stating any item so shown which is required by note (14) of the notes on the profit and loss account formats set out in Part I of this Schedule to be stated after taking into account any necessary provisions for depreciation or diminution in value of assets included under it,

may be the historical cost amount instead of the adjusted amount provided that the amount of any difference between the two is shown separately in the profit and loss account or in a note to the accounts.

Additional information to be provided in case of departure from historical costs accounting rules

33.	(1) This paragraph applies where the amounts to be included in respect of assets covered by any items shown in a company’s accounts have been determined on any basis mentioned in paragraph 31.

(2)	The items affected and the basis of valuation adopted in determining the amounts of the assets in question in the case of such item shall be disclosed in a note to the accounts.

(3)	In the case of each balance sheet item affected (except stocks) either—

(a)	the comparable amounts determined according to the historical cost accounting rules; or

(b)	the differences between those amounts and the corresponding amounts actually shown in the balance sheet in respect of that item,

shall be shown separately in the balance sheet or in a note to the accounts.

(4)	In sub-paragraph (3) above references in relation to any item to the comparable amounts deter-mined as there mentioned are references to—

(a)	the aggregate amount which would be required to be shown in respect of that item if the amounts to be included in respect of all the assets covered by that item were determined ac-cording to the historical cost accounting rules; and

(b)	the aggregate amount of the cumulative provisions for depreciation or diminution in value which would be permitted or required in determining those amounts according to those rules.

Revaluation reserve

34.	(1) With respect to any determination of the value of an asset of a company on any basis mentioned in paragraph 31, the amount of any profit or loss arising from that determination (after allowing, where appropriate, for any provisions for depreciation or diminution in value made otherwise than by reference to the value to be determined and any adjustments of any such provisions made in the light of that determination) shall be credited or (as the case may be) debited to a separate reserve (“the revaluation reserve”).

(2)	The amount of the revaluation reserve shall be shown in the company’s balance sheet under a separate sub-heading in the position given for the item 'revaluation reserve' in Format 1 or 2 of the balance sheet formats set out in Part I of this Schedule, but need not be shown under that name.

(3)	The revaluation reserve shall be reduced to the extent that the amounts standing to the credit of the reserve are in the opinion of the directors of the company no longer necessary for the purpose of the accounting policies adopted by the company, but an amount may only be transferred from the reserve to the profit and loss account if either—

(a)	the amount in question was previously charged to that account; or

(b)	it represents realised profit.

(4)	The treatment for taxation purposes of amounts credited or debited to the revaluation reserve shall be disclosed in a note to the accounts.

If, at the end of its financial year, the company has subsidiaries and the directors are of the opinion that the number of them is such that compliance with paragraph 1 would result in particulars of excessive length being given, compliance with that paragraph shall be required only in the case of the subsidiaries carrying on the business, the results of the carrying on of which (in the opinion of the directors), principally affected the amount of the profit or loss of the company and its subsidiaries or the amount of the assets of the company and its subsidiaries.

5.	If advantage is taken of paragraph 4, there must be included in the statement required by this Part the information that it deals only with the subsidiaries carrying on such businesses as are referred to in that paragraph; and in that case section 339 (3) of this Act (subsequent disclosure with annual return) applies to the particulars given in compliance with paragraph 1, together with those which (but for the fact that advantage is so taken) would have to be so given.

6.	For purposes of this Part, shares of a body corporate are treated as held, or not held, by another such body if they would by virtue of section 338 (4) of this Act be treated as being held or (as the case may be) not held by that other body for the purpose of determining whether the first-mentioned body is its subsidiary.

PART II

Shareholding in companies, etc., other than subsidiaries

7.	If, at the end of a year, the company holds shares of any class comprised in the equity share capital of another body corporate (not being its subsidiary) exceeding in nominal value twenty per cent of the nominal value of the allotted shares of that class, there shall be stated—

(a)	the name of that other body corporate; and—

(i)	if it is incorporated in Nigeria and if it is registered in Nigeria, the part of Nigeria in which it is registered; and

(ii)	if it is incorporated outside Nigeria, the country in which it is incorporated;

(b)	the identity of the class and the proportion of the nominal value of the allotted shares of that class represented by the shares held;

(c)	if the company also holds shares in that other body corporate or another class (whether or not comprised in its equity share capital), or of other classes (whether or not so comprised), the like particulars as respects that other class or (as the case may be) those other classes; and

(d) the accounting treatment, that is to say, the equity or costs.

8.	If, at the end of its year, the company holds shares comprised in the share capital of another body corporate (not being its subsidiary) exceeding in nominal value one tenth of the allotted share capital of that other body, there shall be stated—

(a)	with respect to that other body corporate, the same information as is required by paragraph 7 (a);and

(b)	the identity of each class of such shares held and the proportion of the nominal value of the allotted shares of that class represented by the shares of that class held by the company.

9.	If, at the end of its year, the company holds shares in another body corporate (not being its subsidiary) and the amount of all shares in it which the company holds (as stated or included in the company accounts) exceeds one tenth of the amount of the company’s assets (as so stated), there shall be stated—

(a)	with respect to the other body corporate, the same information as is required by paragraph 7 (a);and

(b)	in relation to shares in that other body corporate of each class held, the identity of the class and the proportion of the nominal value of the allotted shares of that class represented by the shares held.

10.	None of the foregoing provisions of this Part requires the disclosure by a company of information with respect to another body corporate if that other is incorporated outside Nigeria or, being incorporated in Nigeria, carries on business outside it if the disclosure would, in the opinion of the company’s directors, be harmful to the business of the company or of that other body and the Minister agrees that the information need not be disclosed.

11.	If, at the end of its year, the company falls within paragraph 7 or 8 in relation to more bodies corporate than one, and the number of them is such that, in the directors’ opinion, compliance with either or both of those paragraphs would result in particulars of excessive length being given, compliance with paragraph 7 or (as the case may be) paragraph 8, is not required except in the case of bodies carrying on the business the results of the carrying on of which (in the directors’ opinion) principally affected the amount of the profit or loss of the company or the amount of its assets.

12.	If advantage is taken of paragraph 11, there shall be included in the statement dealing with the bodies last mentioned in that paragraph, the information that it deals with them; and section 339 (3) of this Act (subsequent disclosure in annual return) applies to the particulars given in compliance with paragraph 7 or 8 (as the case may be), together with those which, but, for the fact that advantage is so taken, would have to be so given.

13.	For the purposes of this Part, shares of a body corporate are treated as held, or not held, by another such body if they would, by virtue of section 338 (4) of this Act (but on the assumption that paragraph (b) (ii) were omitted from that subsection) be treated as being held or (as the case may be), not held, by that other body for the purpose of determining whether the first-mentioned body is its subsidiary.

This is subject to the exceptions and other provisions in the next paragraph.

17.	(1) The information otherwise required by paragraph 16 need not be given in respect of a subsidiary of a company if, either—

(b)	to any information which would have been required by this Part to be given in relation to a subsidiary or other body corporate but for the exemption under paragraph 4 or 11.

19.	For the purposes of this Part, shares of a body corporate shall be treated as held, or not held, by the company if they would, by virtue of section 338 (4) of this Act (but on the assumption that paragraph (b) (ii) were omitted from that subsection), be treated as being held or (as the case may be), not held by the company for the purpose of determining whether that body corporate is the company’s subsidiary.

In a winding-up by the Court, every creditor shall, subject as hereinafter provided, prove his debt, unless the judge in any particular winding-up shall give directions that any creditor or class of creditors shall be admitted without proof.

75.	Mode of proof

(1)	A debt may be proved in any winding-up by delivering or sending through the post, an affidavit verifying the debt.

(2)	In a winding-up by the Court, the affidavit shall be so sent to the Official Receiver or if a Liqui-dator has been appointed, to the Liquidator; and in any other winding-up, the affidavit may be so sent to the Liquidator.

76.	Verification of proof

An affidavit proving a debt may be made by the creditor himself or by some person authorised by or on behalf of the creditor. If made by a person so authorised, it shall state his authority and means of knowledge.

77.	Contents of proof

(1)	An affidavit proving a debt shall contain or refer to a statement of account showing the particu-lars of the debt in Form 48 in the Appendix, and shall specify the vouchers if any, by which the same can be substantiated.

[Form 48.]

(2)	The Official Receiver or Liquidator to whom the proof is sent may at any time call for the pro-duction of the vouchers.

78.	Statement of security

A creditor proving his debt shall deduct therefrom—

(a)	any discount which he may have agreed to allow for paying in cash in excess of five per cent

of the net amount of his claim; and

(b)       all trade discounts.

82.	Periodical payment

When any rent or other payment falls due at stated periods, and the order or resolution to wind up is made at any time other than one of those periods, the persons entitled to the rent or payment may prove for a proportionate part thereof up to the date of the winding-up order or resolution as if the rent or payment grew due from day-to-day:

Provided that where the Liquidator remains in occupation of premises demised to a company which is being wound up, nothing herein contained shall prejudice or affect the right of the landlord of such premises to claim payment by the company, or the Liquidator, of rent during the period of the company’s or the Liquidator’s occupation.

83.	Interest

On any debt or sum certain, payable at a certain time or otherwise, whereon interest is not reserved or agreed for, and which is overdue at the date of the commencement of the winding-up, the creditor may prove for interest at a rate not exceeding four per cent per annum to that date from the time when the debt or sum was payable, if the debt or sum is payable by virtue of a written instrument at a certain time, and if payable otherwise, then from the time when a demand in writing has been made, giving notice that interest will be claimed from the date of the demand until the time of payment.

84.	Proof for debt payable at a future time

A creditor may prove for a debt not payable at the date of the winding-up order or resolution, as if it were payable presently and may receive dividends equally with the other creditors, deducting debt only thereout, a rebate of interest at the rate of five per cent per annum computed from the declaration of a dividend to the time when the debt would have become payable according to the terms on which it was contracted.

85.	Where formal proof of debt not required

Unless the Official Receiver or Liquidator shall in any special case otherwise direct formal proof of the debts mentioned in section 494 (1) (e) of the Act shall not be required.

86.	Workmen’s wages

(1) In any case in which it appears that there are numerous claims for wages or accrued holiday re-muneration by workmen and others employed by the company, it shall be sufficient if one proof for all such claims in the Form 49 in the Appendix is made either by a foreman or by some other person on behalf of all such creditors.

[Form 49.]

(2)	Such proof shall have annexed thereto as forming part thereof, a schedule setting forth the names of the workmen and others and the amounts severally due to them.

(3)	Any proof made in compliance with this Rule shall have the same effect as if separate proofs have been made by each of the said workmen and others.

87.	Production of bids of exchange and promissory notes

Where a creditor seeks to prove in respect of a bill of exchange, promissory note, or other negotiable instrument or security on which the company is liable, such bill of exchange, note, instrument, or security must, subject to any special order of the Court made to the contrary, be produced to the Official Receiver, chairman of a meeting or Liquidator, as the case may be and be marked by him before the proof can be admitted either for voting or for any purpose.

88.	Transmission of proofs to Liquidator

Where a Liquidator is appointed in a winding-up by the Court, all proofs of debts that have been re-ceived by the Official Receiver shall be handed over to the Liquidator, but the Official Receiver shall first make a list of such proofs and take a receipt thereon from the Liquidator for such proofs.

(2)	The Liquidator shall give notice in writing of the day so fixed by advertisement in such newspaper as he shall consider convenient and in a winding-up by the Court to every person mentioned in the statement of affairs as a creditor, who has not proved his debt and to every person mentioned in the statement of affairs as a preferential creditor whose claim to be a preferential creditor has not been es-tablished and is not admitted and in any other winding-up to the last known address or place of abode of each person who, to the knowledge of the Liquidator, claims to be a creditor or preferential creditor of the company and whose claim has not been admitted.

(1)	Every person for the time being on the list of contributories of the company, and every person whose proof has been admitted, shall be at liberty, at his own expense, to attend proceedings and shall be entitled, upon payment of the costs occasioned thereby, to have notice of all such proceedings as he shall, by written request, desire to have of. If the Court shall have the opinion that the attendance of any such person upon any proceedings has occasioned any additional costs which ought not to be borne by the funds of the company, it may direct such costs, or a gross sum in lieu thereof, to be paid by such person who shall not be entitled to attend any further proceedings until he has paid the same.

(2)	The Court may, from time-to-time, appoint any one or more of the creditors or contributories to represent before the Court, at the expense of the company, all or any class of the creditors or contributo-ries, upon any question or in relation to any proceedings before the Court and may remove the person so appointed. If more than one person is appointed under this Rule to represent one class, the persons appointed shall employ the same solicitor to represent them.

Where the Liquidator carries on the business of the company, he shall not, without the express sanc-tion of the Court, purchase goods for the carrying on of such business from any person whose connec-tion with him is of such a nature as would result in his obtaining any portion of the profit (if any) arising out of the transaction.

146.	Committee of Inspection not to make profit

(1)	No member of a Committee of Inspection shall, except under and with the sanction of the Court, directly or indirectly, by himself, any employer, partner, clerk, agent, or servant, be entitled to derive any profit from any transaction arising out of the winding-up or to receive, out of the assets, any payment for services rendered by him in connection with the administration of the assets, or for any goods supplied by him to the Liquidator for or on account of the company.

(2)	In a winding-up by the Court, if it appears to the Ministry or in a voluntary winding-up, if it ap-pears to the Committee of Inspection or to any meeting of creditors or contributories, that any profit or payment has been made contrary to the provisions of this Rule, the Ministry, Committee of Inspection or meeting, as the case may be, may disallow such payment or recover such profit, on the audit of the Liquidator’s accounts or otherwise.

Provided that such Liquidator, before the assets are handed over to him by the Official Receiver, shall have discharged any balance due to the Official Receiver on account of fees, costs, and charges properly incurred by him, and on account of any advances properly made by him in respect of the com-pany, together with interest on such advances at the rate of ten per cent per annum, and the Liquidator shall pay all fees, costs, and charges of the Official Receiver which may not have been discharged by the Liquidator before being put into possession of the property of the company, whether incurred before or after he has been put into such possession.

Affidavit of Liquidator in support ofproposal for call

{Title)

I	of	.	 the Liquidator of the above-named

company, make oath and say as follows—

1.	I have in the schedule now produced and shown to me, and marked with the letter A set forth a statement

showing the amount due in respect of the debts proved and admitted against the said company, and the estimated amount of the costs, charges and expenses of and incidental to the winding-up the affairs thereof, which several amounts form in the aggregate the sum of N 	 or thereabouts.

2.	I have also in the said schedule set forth a statement of the assets in hand belonging to the said company,

amounting to the sum of H	and no more. There are no other assets belonging to the

said company, except the amounts due from certain of the contributories of the said company, and, to the best of my information and belief, it will be impossible to realise in respect of the said amounts more than the sum of H	 or thereabouts.

3	persons have been settled by me on the lost

of contributories of the said company in respect of the total number of	shares.

4.	For the purpose of satisfying the several debts and liabilities of the said company and of paying the costs,

charges and expenses of and incidental to the winding-up the affairs thereof, I believe the sum of H	

will be required in addition to the amount of the assets of the said company mentioned in the said Schedule A, and the said sum of H	

5.	In order to provide the said sum of N	it is necessary to make a call upon the

several persons who have been settled on the list of contributories as before mentioned, and having regard to the probability that some of such contributories will partly or wholly fail to pay the amount of such call, I believe that, for the purpose of realising the amount required as before mentioned, it is necessary that a call of N	 per share should be made.

(No. of Company)

A Commissioner for Oaths

Statement of receipts and payments and

general directions as to statements

{Name of company)

(1)	Every statement must contain a detailed account of all the Liquidators’ realisations and disbursements in respect of the company. The statement of realisations should contain a record of all receipts derived from assets existing at the date of the winding-up resolution and subsequently realised, including balance in bank, book debts and calls collected, property sold, etc., and the account of disbursements should contain all payments for costs and charges, or to creditors or contributories. Where property has been realised, the gross proceeds of sale must be entered under realisations, and the necessary payments incidental to sales must be entered as disbursements. These accounts should not contain payments into the Companies Liquidation Account (except unclaimed dividends see paragraph 5) or payments into or out of bank, or temporary investments by the Liquidator, or the proceeds of such investments when realised, which should be shown separately—

(a)	by means of the bank pass book;

(b)	 by a separate detailed statement of monies invested by the Liquidator, and investment realised.

Interest allowed or charged by the bank, bank commission, & etc., and profit or loss upon the realisation of temporary investments, should, however, be inserted in the accounts of realisations or disbursements, as the case may be. Each receipt and payment must he entered in the account in such a manner as sufficiently to explain its nature. The receipts and payments must severally be added up at the foot of each sheet, and the totals carried forward from one account to another without any intermediate balance, so that the gross totals shall represent the total amounts received and paid by the Liquidator respectively.

[Forms and contents of statement.]

(2)	When the Liquidator carries on a business, a trading account must be forwarded as a distinct account, and the totals of receipts and payments on the trading account must alone be set out in the statement.

[Trading Account.]

(3)	When dividends or instalments of compositions are paid to creditors or a return of surplus assets is made to contributories, the total amount of each dividend, or instalment of composition, or return to contributories, actually paid must be entered in the statement of disbursements as one sum, and the Liquidator must forward separate accounts showing in the lists the amount of the claim of each creditor, and the amount of dividend or composition payable to each creditor, and of surplus assets payable to each contributory, distinguishing in each list the dividends or instalment of composition and shares of surplus assets actually paid and those remaining unclaimed.

[Dividends etc.]

(4)	When unclaimed dividends, instalments of composition or return of surplus assets are paid into the Companies Liquidation Account, the total amount so paid in should be entered in the statement of disbursements as one sum.

(5)	Credit should not be taken in the statement of disbursements for any amount in respect of the Liquidator’s remuneration unless it has been duly allowed by resolution of the Committee of Inspection or of the creditors or of the company in general meeting, or by order of Court as the case may require.
