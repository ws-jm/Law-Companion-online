(1)	The profits of a Nigerian company shall be deemed to accrue in Nigeria wherever they have arisen and whether or not they have been brought into or received in Nigeria.

(2)	The profits of a company other than a Nigerian company from any trade or business shall be deemed to be derived from Nigeria—

(1)	Where a company other than a Nigerian company carries on the business of transport by sea or air, and any ship or aircraft owned or chartered by it calls at any port or airport in Nigeria, its profits or loss to be deemed to be derived from Nigeria shall be the full profits or loss arising from the carriage of passengers, mails, livestock or goods shipped, or loaded into an aircraft, in Nigeria:

Provided that this subsection shall not apply to passengers, mails, livestock or goods which are brought to Nigeria solely for trans-shipment or for transfer from one aircraft to another or in either di-rection between an aircraft and a ship.

(2)	For the purposes of the preceding subsection, where the Board is satisfied that the taxation au-thority of any other country computes and assesses on a basis not materially different from that pre-scribed by this Act the profits of a company which operates ships or aircraft, and that authority certifies—

(a)	the ratio of profits or loss, before any allowance by way of depreciation, of an accounting period to the total sums receivable in respect of the carriage of passengers, mails, livestock or goods; and

(b)	the ratio of allowances by way of depreciation for that period to that same total,

then the full profits or loss of that period shall be taken to be that proportion of the total sums receivable in respect of the carriage of passengers, mails, livestock or goods shipped or loaded in Nigeria which is produced by applying the first-mentioned ratio to that total, and in place of any allowances to be given under the provisions of the Second Schedule there shall be allowed the amount produced by applying the second-mentioned ratio to that same total.

[Second Schedule.]

(3)	Where at the time of assessment, the provisions of subsection (2) of this section cannot for any reason be satisfactorily applied, the profits to be deemed to be derived from Nigeria may be computed on a fair percentage on the full sum receivable in respect of the carriage of passengers, mails, livestock and goods shipped or loaded in Nigeria:

Provided that where any company has been assessed for any year by reference to such percentage, it shall be entitled to claim at any time within six years after the end of such year that its liability for that year be re-computed on the basis provided by subsection (2) of this section; and where such claim has been made and a certificate has been produced to the satisfaction of the Board as provided in that sub-section, such repayment of tax shall be made as may be necessary to give effect to this proviso, save that, if the company fails to agree with the Board as to the amount of the tax to be so re-computed and repaid, the Board shall give notice to the company of refusal to admit the claim and the provisions of this Act with respect to objections and appeals shall apply accordingly with any necessary modifications.

(4)	For the purposes of this section, the tax payable by any company for any year of assessment shall not be less than two per cent of the full sum receivable in respect of the carriage of passengers, mails, livestock or goods shipped or loaded into an aircraft in Nigeria.

15.	Cable undertakings

Where a company other than a Nigerian company carries on the business of transmission of messages by cable or by any form of wireless apparatus, it shall be assessable to tax as though it operates ships or aircraft, and the provisions of the preceding section shall apply mutatis mutandis to the computation of its profits deemed to be derived from Nigeria as though the transmission of messages to places outside Nigeria were equivalent to the shipping or loading of passengers, mails, livestock or goods in Nigeria.

16.	Insurance companies

(1)	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Act, insurance business shall be taxed as—

(a)	an insurance company, whether proprietary or mutual, other than a life insurance company; or

(b)	a Nigerian company whose profit accrued in part outside Nigeria,

the profit on which tax may be imposed, shall be ascertained by taking the gross premium interest and other income receivable in Nigeria less reinsurance and deducting from the balance so arrived at, a reserve for unexpired risks at the percentage consistently adopted by the company in relation to its operations as a whole for such risks at the end of the period for which the profits are being ascertained, subject to the limitation imposed in subsection (8) (a) of this section.

(2)	The profits on which tax may be imposed in an insurance company which is a life insurance company, whether proprietary or mutual, other than a Nigerian company which carries on business through a permanent establishment in Nigeria shall—

(a)	be the investment income less the management expenses, including commission, subject to the limitation imposed in subsection (8) (b) of this section; and

(b)	where the profits of the company accrue in part outside Nigeria, be that proportion of the total investment income of the company as the premium earned whether received or receivable, less the agency expenses in Nigeria and a fair proportion of expenses of the head office of the company but where the insurance company has its head office outside Nigeria the Board may substitute some basis other than that prescribed in this paragraph for ascertaining the required proportion or the total investment income.

(3)	Any amount distributed in any form as dividend from an actuarial revaluation of unexpired risks or from any other revaluation shall be deemed to be part of the total profits of the company for tax purposes.

(4)	Not more than three months after an actuarial revaluation of the unexpired risks or any other re-valuation has taken place, the Company shall provide the Board with full particulars of the revaluation carries out, including a copy of the actuary’s revaluation certificate.

(a)	in a general Nigerian insurance company, shall be ascertained in accordance with the provi-sions of subsection (1) of this section as though the whole premium and investment incomes of the company were derived from Nigeria; and

(b)	in a Nigerian life insurance company shall be ascertained in accordance with the provisions of subsections (2), (3) and (4) of this section as though the whole investment and other incomes were received in Nigeria and all the expenses and other outgoings of the company were incurred in Nigeria.

(6)	Where an insurance company carries on a life class and a general class insurance business, the funds and books of accounts of one class shall be kept separate from the other as though one class does not relate to the other class, and the annual tax returns of the two classes of insurance businesses shall be made separately. 

(7)	Each class of insurance shall be assessed separately as 'life insurance assessment' and 'non-life (other) insurance assessment' and in respect of each class of insurance business where there are more than one type of insurance in the same class, they form one type of business and shall not be allowed against the income from another type of insurance business but the loss shall be available to be carried forward against profits from the same class of insurance business and, in all cases, the period of carrying forward of a loss shall be limited to four years of assessment.

(8)	An insurance company, other than a life insurance company, shall be allowed as deductions from its premium the following reserves for tax purposes—

(a)	for unexpired risks, forty-five per cent of the total premium in case of general insurance business other than marine insurance business and twenty-five per cent of the total premium in the case of marine cargo insurance;

(b)	for other reserves, claims and outgoings of the company an amount equal to twenty-five per cent of the total premium, so that, after allowance under the Second Schedule to this Act as may be restricted, has been allowed for in any year of assessment, not less than an amount equal to fifteen per cent of the total profit of the company for tax purposes.

[Second Schedule.]

(c)	all normal allowable business outgoing, except that after allowing for all the outgoing and allowance under the Second Schedule to this Act as may be restricted under the provisions of this Act for any year of assessment, not less than an amount equal to twenty per cent of the gross incomes shall be available as ‘total profit’ of the company for tax purposes.

[Second Schedule.]

(10)	A reinsurance company shall be allowed the following deductions from its gross profit to be credited to a general reserve fund—

(a)	an amount not more than fifty per cent of the gross profits of the reinsurer for the year where the general reserve fund is less than the initial statutory minimum authorised share capital; or

(b)	an amount not more than twenty-five per cent of the gross profit of the reinsurer for the year, where the fund is equal to or exceeds the initial statutory minimum authorised share capital.

(11)	An insurance company that engages the services of an insurance agent, a loss adjuster and an insurance broker shall include in its annual tax returns, a schedule showing the name and address of that agent, loss adjuster and insurance broker, the date their services were employed and terminated, as ap-plicable, and payments made to each such agent, loss adjuster and insurance broker for the period covered by the tax returns.

[No. 11 of 2007, s. 4.]

(EDITORIAL NOTE: Please note that although section 4 of Act No. 11 of 2007 instructs section 14 to

(1)	Where under any of the provisions of the Investments and Securities Act, a unit trust scheme is established for the purpose of providing facilities for the participation of the public, as beneficiaries under a trust, in profits or income arising from acquisition, holding, management or disposal of securities or any other property whatsoever, this Act shall, in respect of the income arising to the trustees of an authorised unit trust, have effect—

[Cap. 124.]

(a)	as if the trustees were a company whose business consists mainly in the making of investments and the principal part of whose income is derived therefrom;

(b)	as if the rights of the unit holders were shares in the company; and

(c)	as if so much of the income accruing to the trustees as is available for payment to the unit holders were dividends on such shares,

                  and reference in this Act to a company shall be construed in accordance with this subsection.

[No. 63 of 1991.]

(2)	For the purpose of section 32 of this Act, the profits of an authorised unit scheme, on which tax may be imposed, shall be ascertained by taking the income accruing to the trustees from all sources of the investment of the unit trust and deducting therefrom sums disbursed as management expenses, including remuneration for the managers.

[No. 63 of 1991.]

(3)	Where the trustees of a unit trust receive a payment on which the unit trust suffers tax by deduc-tion (not being franked investment income), the tax thereon shall be set off against any income on the trustees by an assessment made for the year of assessment in which the receipt, on which the tax deduc-tion was made, falls to be taken into account in ascertaining the tax payable by the unit trust for the year of assessment.

[No. 63 of 1991.]

(4)	The provisions of section 53 of this Act shall apply to a dividend accruing to the trustees of a unit trust.

[No. 63 of 1991.]

18.	Profits of a company from certain dividends

The profits of a company from a dividend received from any other company shall be—

(a)	if that other company is resident in a country to which section 44 of this Act applies, the amount of that dividend increased by the amount of any tax imposed in that country relative to that dividend; and

(b)	if that other company is resident in a country to which section 45 of this Act applies, the amount of that dividend as computed under the provisions of section 46 (5) of this Act:

Provided that a dividend distributed—

(i)	by a Nigerian company and satisfied by the issue of shares of the company paying the dividend; or

(ii)	if the company is a Nigerian company, out of any profits exempted from tax by any provision of this Act, or of the Industrial Development (Income Tax Relief) Act; or

[Cap. 17.]

(iii)	if the company is chargeable to tax under the provisions of the Petroleum Profits Tax Act, out of any profits to which section 60 of that Act applies,

(c)	nothing in this Act shall confer on such company or on the company paying the dividend, a right to repayment of tax paid by reason of the provisions of this section. 

21.	Certain undistributed profits may be treated as distributed

(2)	Any amount of profits treated as distributed under the provisions of the foregoing subsection shall, for the purposes of this Act and any enactment in Nigeria imposing tax on the incomes of persons other than companies, be deemed to be profits or income from a dividend accruing to those persons who are shareholders in the company in proportion to their shares in the ordinary capital thereof on such day, and the amount of such profits or income to be taken for assessment in the hands of each such person shall be his due proportion thereof increased by such amount in respect of tax deemed to be deducted at source, as the Board may determine.

(a)	the day to be taken for the purposes of the preceding subsection;

(b)	the net amount of those profits so deemed to be distributed;

(c)	the rate of tax deemed to be deducted, being the rate prescribed in section 80 (2) of this Act;

(d)	the gross amount which, after deduction of tax at the said rate, leaves such net amount of

those profits; and

(2)	The amount of the tax chargeable in respect of the profits which are liable to both tax and foreign tax shall be reduced by the amount of the credit admissible under the terms of the arrangement:

Provided that no credit shall be allowed to a company for a year of assessment unless during some part of that year it was a Nigerian company.

(3)	The credit shall not exceed the amount which would be produced by computing, in accordance with the provisions of this Act, the amount of the profits which are liable to both tax and foreign tax, and then charging that amount to tax at a rate ascertained by dividing the tax chargeable (before the deduction of any double taxation relief granted by this Part of this Act) on the total profits of the company entitled to the profits by the amount of the total profits.

(4)	Without prejudice to the provisions of subsection (3) of this section, the total credit to be allowed to a company for a year of assessment for foreign tax under all arrangements having effect under section 45 of this Act shall not exceed the total tax payable by it for that year of assessment.

(5)	In computing the amount of the profits—

(a)	no deduction shall be allowed in respect of foreign tax (whether in respect of the same or any other profits);

(b)	where tax chargeable depends on the amount received in Nigeria, the said amount shall be increased by the appropriate amount of the foreign tax in respect of the profits; and

(c)	where the profits include a dividend and under the arrangements foreign tax not chargeable directly or by deduction in respect of the dividend is to be taken into account in considering whether any, and if so what, credit is to be given against tax in respect of the dividend, the amount of the profits shall be increased by the amount of the foreign tax not so chargeable which falls to be taken into account in computing the amount of the credit, but notwithstanding anything in the preceding provisions of this subsection a deduction shall be allowed of any amount by which the foreign tax in respect of the profits exceeds the credit thereof.

(6)	Section (5) (a) and (b), but not the remainder thereof shall, apply to the computation of total profits for the purpose of determining the rate mentioned in subsection (3) of this section, and shall apply thereto in relation to all profits in respect of which credit falls to be given for foreign tax under ar-rangements for the time being in force under section 45 of this Act.

(7)	Where—

(a)	the arrangements provide, in relation to dividends of some classes but not in relation to divi-dends of other classes, that foreign tax not chargeable directly or by deduction in respect of dividends is to be taken into account in considering whether any, and if so what, credit is to be given against tax in respect of the dividends; and

(b)	a dividend is paid which is not of a class in relation to which the arrangements so provide,

then, if the dividend is paid to a company which controls, directly or indirectly, not less than one half of the voting power in the company paying the dividend, credit shall be allowed as if the dividend were a dividend of a class in relation to which the arrangements so provide.

(8)	Credit shall not be allowed under the arrangements against tax chargeable in respect of the profits of a company for any year of assessment if the company elects that credit shall not be allowed in the case of those profits for that year.

(9)	Any claim for an allowance by way of credit shall be made not later than two years after the end of assessment, and in the event of any dispute as to the amount allowable the claim shall be subject to objection and appeal in like manner as an assessment.

(10)	Where the amount of any credit given under the arrangements is rendered excessive or insuffi-cient by reason of any adjustment of the amount of any tax payable in Nigeria or elsewhere, nothing in this Act limiting the time for the making of assessments or claims for relief shall apply to any assessment or claim to which the adjustment gives rise, being an assessment or claim made not later than two years from the time when all such assessments, adjustments and other determinations have been made, whether in Nigeria or elsewhere, as are material in determining whether any, and if so what, credit falls to be given.

1. Interpretation

(1)	For the purposes of this Schedule—

'basis period' has the meaning assigned to it by the following provisions of this definition—

(a) in the case of company to or on which any allowance of charge falls to be made in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule, its basis period for the year of assessment is the period by reference to the profits of which any assessable profits for that year fall to be computed under the provisions of section 29 of this Act;

(b) such profits mean profits in respect of the trade or business in which there was used an asset in connection with which such allowance or charge falls to be made:

Provided that, in the case of any such trade or business—

(i)	where two basis periods overlap, the period common to both shall be deemed, except for the purpose of making an annual allowance, to fall in the basis period ending at the earlier date and in no other basis period;

(ii)	where two basis periods coincide, they shall be treated as overlapping, and the basis period for the earlier year of assessment shall be treated as ending before the end of the basis period for the later year of assessment;

(iii)	where there is an interval between the end of the basis period for one year of assessment and the basis period for the next year of assessment, then unless the second-mentioned year of assessment is the year in which, for the purposes of section 29 (4), such company permanently ceases to carry on the trade or business, the interval shall be deemed to be part of the second basis period; and

(iv)	where there is an interval between the end of the basis period for the year of assessment preceding that in which the trade or business permanently ceases, for the purposes of section 29 (4), to be carried on by such company and the basis period for the year in which it so ceases, the interval shall be deemed to form part of the first basis period;

'concession' includes a mining right and a mining lease;

'lease' includes an agreement for a lease where the term to be covered by the lease has begun, any tenancy and any agreement for the letting or hiring out of an asset, but does not include a mortgage, and the expression 'leasehold interest' shall be construed accordingly and—

(a)	where, with the consent of the lessor, a lease of any asset remains in possession thereof after the termination of the lease without a new lease being granted to him, that lease shall be deemed for the purposes of this Schedule to continue so long as he remains in possession as aforesaid; and

(b)	where, on the termination of a lease of any asset, a new lease of that asset is granted to the lessee, the provisions of this Schedule shall have effect as if the second lease were a continuation of this first lease;

(a)	capital expenditure (hereinafter called 'qualifying plant expenditure”) incurred on plant, ma-chinery or fixtures;

(i)	on the clearing of land for planting;

(ii)	on planting (other than replanting);

(iv)	on the acquisition of, or of rights in or over, the deposits or on the purchase of information relating to the existing and extent of the deposits;

(v)	on searching for or on discovering and testing deposits, or winning access thereto;

(i)	expenditure is incurred for the purposes of a trade or business by a company about to carry on such trade or business; and

(ii)	that expenditure is incurred in respect of an asset owned by that company if that expenditure would have fallen to be treated as qualifying expenditure if it had been incurred by that company on the first day on which it carries on that trade or business,

that expenditure shall be deemed to be qualifying expenditure incurred by it on that day;

(f) capital expenditure, that is, qualifying research and development expenditure, incurred on equipment and facilities, patents, licences, secret formula or process or for information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific process; technical feasibility of products or processes and purchases, searching for and discovering and testing products or process for future market or use; and such other similar cost which has not brought into existence any asset;

(b)	such expenditure has not brought into existence any asset; and

(c)	such trade or business consists of the working of a mine, oil well or other source of mineral deposits of a wasting nature,

then such expenditure shall be deemed to have brought into existence an asset owned by the company incurring the expenditure and in use for the purpose of such trade or business.

(2)	For the purpose of this Schedule, an asset in respect of which qualifying mining expenditure has been incurred by any company for the purposes of a trade or business carried on by it, and which has not been disposed of, shall be deemed not to cease to be used for the purpose of that trade or business so long as such company continues to carry on that trade or business.

(3)	So much of any qualifying mining expenditure incurred on the acquisition of rights in or over mineral deposits and on the purchase of information relating to the existence and extent of the deposits as exceeds the total of the original cost of acquisition of such rights and of the cost of searching for, discovering and testing such deposits prior to the purchase of such information, shall be left out of account for the purposes of this Schedule:

Provided that where such costs were originally incurred by a company which carried on a trade or business consisting, as to the whole or part thereof, in the acquisition of such rights or information with a view to the assignment or sale thereof, the price paid on such assignment or sale shall be substituted for the aforementioned costs.

3.	Owner and meaning of 'relevant interest'

(1)	For the purposes of this Schedule, where an asset consists of a building, structure or works, the owner thereof shall be taken to be the owner of the relevant interest in such building, structure or works.

(2)	Subject to the provisions of this paragraph, in this Schedule, the expression 'the relevant interest' means, in relation to any expenditure incurred on the construction of a building, structure or works, the interest in such building, structure or works to which the person who incurred such expenditure was entitled when he incurred it.

(3)	Where, when he incurs qualifying building expenditure or qualifying mining expenditure on the construction of a building, structure or works, a person is entitled to two or more interests therein, and one of those interests is an interest which is reversionary on all the others, that interest shall be the relevant interest for the purposes of this Schedule.

4.	Sale of buildings

Where capital expenditure has been incurred on the construction of a building, structure or works and thereafter the relevant interest therein is sold, any company which buys that interest shall be deemed, for all the purposes of this Schedule except the granting of initial allowances, to have incurred, on the date when the purchase price became payable, capital expenditure on the construction thereof equal to the price paid by it for such interest or to the original cost of construction whichever is the less:

Provided that where such relevant interest is sold before the building, structure or works has been used, the foregoing provisions of this paragraph shall have effect with respect to such sales with the omission of the words 'except the granting of initial allowances' and the original cost of construction shall be taken to be the amount of the purchase price on such sale:

Provided also that where any such relevant interest is sold more than once before the building, structure or works is used, the provisions of the foregoing proviso shall have effect only in relation to the last of those sales.

5.	Qualifying industrial building expenditure

For the purpose of this Schedule—

(a) where but for this paragraph a company is entitled to an annual allowance in respect of quali-fying building expenditure in respect of an asset in use, for the purposes of a trade or business carried on by it at the end of its basis period for any year of assessment, if that asset is an industrial building or structure in use as such at the end of its basis period for any such year then, in lieu of such allowance and qualifying building expenditure, the qualifying expenditure in respect of that asset shall be taken to mean 'qualifying industrial building expenditure' for any allowances to be made to such company, in respect of that qualifying expenditure, for that year; and

(2)	Where capital expenditure is incurred on the purchase of an asset and either purchaser is a person over whom the seller has control, or the seller is a person over whom the purchaser has control, or some other person has control over both the purchaser and the seller, then, the amount of any initial allowance to be made in respect of such expenditure shall be such an amount as the Board may determine to be just and reasonable having regard to all the circumstances relating to such asset and control:

Provided that any such amount shall not exceed the amount of the initial allowance which would have been allowable apart from the provisions of this sub-paragraph.

(3)	Where a company has incurred qualifying expenditure for the purchase of plants and machineries for the replacement of the old ones, there shall be allowed such company a once and for all ninety-five per cent capital allowances in the first year, with five per cent retention as the book value until the final disposal of the asset:

7.	Annual allowances

(1)	Subject to the provisions of this Schedule, where in its basis period for a year of assessment, a company owning any asset has incurred in respect thereof qualifying expenditure wholly, exclusively, necessarily and reasonably for the purpose of a trade or business carried on by it, whether or not an initial allowance was made in respect of that qualifying expenditure, there shall be made to that company for each year of assessment, in its basis period for which that asset was used for the purpose of that trade or business, an allowance (hereinafter called 'an annual allowance' at the rate specified in respect thereof in Table II of this Schedule of such expenditure after the deduction of initial allowance where applicable:

Provided that an amount of N10 shall be retained in the accounts for tax purposes until the asset is disposed of:

Provided further that where the basis period for any year of assessment is a period of less that one year and such allowance for that year of assessment shall be proportionately reduced.

(2)	In the case of an asset in respect of which an allowance has been granted before the commencement of this sub-paragraph, an allowance shall be made in respect of the asset for the number of years which, if added to the number of years of assessment for which allowance has already been made, equals the number of years of assessment for which allowance is to be made under the provisions of sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph:

Provided that if an allowance has been made for a number of years which is equal to or more than the number of years specified under sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph, a single allowance shall be made for an amount which is N10 less than the residue of the qualifying expenditure for the year of assessment in which this sub-paragraph takes effect.

8.	Asset to be in use at the end of basis period

Provided that a balancing charge shall only be made in respect of such asset if immediately prior to its disposal it was in use by such owner in the trade or business for the purposes of which such qualifying expenditure was incurred and shall not exceed the total of any allowances made to such owner under the provisions of this Schedule in respect of such asset and in cases falling under paragraph 19 of the Fourth Schedule to the Personal Income Tax Act, of any deductions made under section 10 of that Act in respect of the capital cost of such asset.

[Fourth Schedule and Cap. P8.]

13.	Value of an asset

(1)	The value of an asset at the date of its disposal shall be the net proceeds of the sale thereof or of the relevant interest therein, or if it was disposed of without being sold, the amount which, in the opinion of the Board, such asset or the relevant interest therein, as the case may be, would have fetched if sold in the open market at that date, less the amount of any expenses which the owner might reasonably be expected to incur if the asset were so sold.

(2)	For the purposes of this paragraph, if an asset is disposed of in such circumstances that insurance or compensation monies are received by the owner thereof, the asset or the relevant interests therein, as the case may be, shall be treated as having been sold and as though the net proceeds of the insurance or compensation monies were the net proceeds of the sale thereof.

(3)	So much of sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph as relates to the circumstances for determining the value of an asset by reference to the disposal of such asset, other than by way of sale, shall have effect—

(a)	in relation to any asset or the relevant interest therein disposed of not being by way of bargain made at arm’s length; or

14.	Apportionment

(1)	Any reference in this Schedule to the disposal, sale or purchase of any asset includes a reference to the disposal, sale or purchase of that asset, as the case may be, together with any other asset, whether or not qualifying expenditure has been incurred on such last-mentioned asset; and where an asset is disposed of, sold, or purchased together with another asset, so much of the value of the assets as, on a just apportionment, is properly attributable to the first-mentioned asset shall, for the purposes of this Schedule, be deemed to be the value of or the price paid for that asset, as the case may be.

For the purposes of this sub-paragraph, all the assets which are purchased or disposed of in pursuance of one bargain shall be deemed to be purchased or disposed of together, notwithstanding that separate prices are or purport to be agreed for each of those assets or that there are or purport to be separate purchases or disposals of those assets.

(2)	The provisions of sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph shall apply, with any necessary modifica-tions, to the sale or purchase of the relevant interest in any asset together with any other asset or relevant interest in any other asset.

(b)	the said dates shall be taken to be the date on which such expenditure was incurred and the date on which the asset is in fact first put to use:

Provided that where any allowances have been given in consequence of this sub-paragraph and the first use to which such asset is put is not for the purposes of such trade or business, all such additional assessments shall be made as may be necessary to counteract the benefit obtained from the giving of any such allowances.

17.	Exclusion of certain expenditure

Where any company has incurred expenditure which is allowed to be deducted, in computing the profits of its trade or business under section 24 of this Act, such expenditure shall not be treated as qualifying expenditure.

18.	Application of lessors

(a)	has incurred capital expenditure in respect thereof; or

(b)	leases that asset to any person under an operating lease contract for use wholly, exclusively, necessarily and reasonably for the purpose of a trade or business carried on by such person,

the provisions of this Schedule shall apply, as though such expenditure were incurred for the purpose of a trade or business carried on by the owner or lessor and as though the owner or lessor were using the asset for the purpose of such last-mentioned trade or business in the way in which and for the period or periods during which the asset is in fact in the first-mentioned trade or business.

[No. 3 of 1993.]

(2)	Where however an asset is acquired by any hirer or lessee under a finance lease contract the terms of which provide for the transfer of ownership, risks and reward to the hirer or lessee, the provisions of this Schedule shall apply in the same way as it applies to an asset acquired by any owner or lessor of an asset for the purpose of his trade or business, but shall so apply subject to the following modifications that is to say—

[No. 3 of 1993.]

(3)	Subject to the provisions of this Schedule, where a company has incurred capital expenditure on plant and machinery or acquires same by virtue of sub-paragraph (2) of this paragraph, wholly, exclusively, necessarily and reasonably for the purpose of a trade or business carried on by it, there shall be due an in-vestment allowance of ten per cent of such expenditure.

(2)	Any allowances and any charges which would be made if both such expenditure were incurred wholly, exclusively, necessarily and reasonably for the purposes of such trade or business and such asset were used wholly and exclusively for the purposes of such trade or business shall be computed in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule.

(3)	So much of the allowances and charges computed in accordance with the provisions of sub- paragraph (2) of this paragraph shall be made as in the opinion of the Board is just and reasonable having regard to all the circumstances and to the provisions of this Schedule.

20.	Disposal without change of ownership

Where an asset in respect of which qualifying expenditure has been incurred by the owner thereof has been disposed of in such circumstances that such owner remains the owner thereof, then, for the purposes of determining whether and, if so, in what amount, any annual or balancing allowance or balancing charge shall be made to or on such owner in respect of his use of the asset after the date of such disposal—

(a)	qualifying expenditure incurred by such owner in respect of such asset prior to the date of such disposal shall be let out of account; but

(b)	such owner shall be deemed to have bought such asset immediately after such disposal for a price equal to the residue of such qualifying expenditure at the date of such disposal, increased by the amount of any balancing charge or decreased by the amount of any balancing allowance made as a result of such disposal.

21.	Meaning of 'allowances made'

Any reference in this Schedule to an allowance made includes a reference to an allowance which would be made but for an insufficiency of assessable profits against which to make it.

Provided that where any such charge falls to be made on any company for any year of assessment, whenever necessary by reason of the assessment on that company having become final and conclusive for that year or for other sufficient reason, the Board may make an additional assessment upon such company in respect of the amount of such charge.

(2)	Subject to the provisions of this paragraph, the amount of any allowance to be made to a company under the provisions of this Schedule shall be made by making a deduction from the remainder of its assessable profits for the year of assessment for which such allowance falls to be made under the provisions of this Schedule.

(3)	For the purposes of this paragraph, any such remainder for a year of assessment shall be ascertained by first giving full effect to the provisions of sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph and to the provisions of section 31 relating to the deduction of the amount of any loss.

(4)	Where full effect cannot be given to any deduction to be made under sub-paragraph (2) of this paragraph for any year of assessment owing to there being no such remainder for that year, or owing to the remainder for that year being less than such deduction, the deduction or part of the deduction to which effect has not been given, as the case may be, shall, for the purpose of ascertaining total profits (of the company entitled to such deduction) under section 31 for the following year, be deemed to be a deduction for that year, in accordance with the provisions of sub-paragraph (2) of this paragraph, and so on for succeeding years.

(5)	Where a company is entitled to a deduction under the preceding sub-paragraph, or to a deduction in respect of a balancing allowance, in respect of an asset used in a trade or business carried on by it, for a year of assessment in which that trade or business permanently ceases to be carried on by it and full effect cannot be given to any such deduction for that year owing to there being no such remainder of assessable profits for that year, or owing to the remainder of its assessable profits for that year being less than such deduction, that deduction or the part to which effect has not been given, as the case may be, may, on a claim being made by such company, be given by way of deduction from any remainder of its assessable profits for the preceding year of assessment, and so on for other preceding years, so, however, that no such deduction shall be given by virtue of this sub-paragraph for any year earlier than the fifth year before the first-mentioned year of assessment:

Provided that where any relief is given under this sub-paragraph in respect of any such deduction, the provisions of the preceding sub-paragraph shall cease to have effect in respect of that deduction for any year of assessment subsequent to the year of assessment in which such trade or business ceases.

(6)	Where any deduction falls to be given under the provisions of the preceding sub-paragraph for any preceding years of assessment, whenever necessary, by reason of any assessments for those years having become final and conclusive, or for other sufficient reason, the Board, with respect to each such year, may make such repayment or set-off of the tax, or of any part of such tax, paid or charged for any such year as may be appropriate, in lieu of making any such deduction.

(7)	In giving effect to the provisions of sub-paragraph (2) of this paragraph, the amount of capital al-lowances to be deducted from assessable profits in any year of assessment shall not exceed sixty-six and two thirds of a per cent of such assessable profits of a company, but any company in the agro-allied industry or which is engaged in the trade or business of manufacturing, shall not be affected by the restriction under this sub-paragraph.

[No. 21 of 1991.]

ARTICLE 8

Shipping and air transport

1.	A resident of a Contracting State shall be exempted from tax in the other Contracting State in respect of profits or gains derived from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic.

For the purpose of this paragraph, the term 'earnings' means income from freight, mails and sale of tickets and other such income less refunds and payments of wages and salaries of ground staff.

ARTICLE 9

Association enterprises

1.	Where—

{a) an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State; or

(b) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State,

and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profit which would, but for those conditions, have not so accrued to one of the enterprise but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.

2.	Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State, and taxes accordingly profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to the enterprises of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises, had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make such adjustment as it considers appropriate to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Agreement and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall, if necessary, consult each other.

ARTICLE 10

Dividends

1.	Dividends derived from a company which is a resident of a Contracting State by a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.

2.	However, such dividend may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying other dividends is a resident and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the dividends is a resident according to the laws of that State, the tax so charged shall not exceed—

(a)	twelve and a half per cent of the gross amount of the dividends if the recipient is a company which controls directly or indirectly at least 10 per cent of the voting power in the company paying the dividends;

(b)	fifteen per cent of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases. This paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid.

3.	The provisions of paragraph 1 or 2 of this Article shall not apply where the beneficial owner of the divi-dends, being a resident of a Contracting State, has in the other Contracting State a permanent establishment or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein and the holding by virtue of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with the business carried on through such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such a case, the provisions of Article 7 or 14, as the case may be, shall apply.

4.	Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of the first-mentioned State or except insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in that other State, nor subject the company’s undistributed profits to a tax on undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in that other State.

5.	The provisions of this Article shall not apply if the right giving rise to the dividends was created or as-signed mainly for the purpose of taking advantage of this Article and not for bona fide commercial reasons.

In such a case, the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.

4.	Royalties shall be deemed to be derived in a Contracting State where the payer is that State itself, a political sub-division, a local authority or a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether he is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred and such royalties are borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, such royalties shall be deemed to arise in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.

Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3 where an enterprise of one of the Contracting States carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment.

and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profit which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.

2.	Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that Contracting State - and taxes accordingly - profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other Contracting State and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned Contracting State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would be made between independent enterprises, then that other Contracting State may make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Agreement and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall, if necessary, consult each other.

ARTICLE 10

This paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid.

In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.

4.	Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other Contracting State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the com-pany, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other Contracting State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in that other Contracting State, nor subject the company’s undistributed profits to a tax on the company’s undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other Contracting State.

In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.

5.	Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is that State itself, a political subdivision, (in case of Nigeria), a local authority or a resident of that State.

6.	Where, owing to a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest exceeds, for whatever commercial reason, the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount.

3.	The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the royalties arise, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other Contracting State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.

5.	Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties, having regard to the use, right or information for which they are paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount.

Enterprises of a Contracting State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly by one or more residents of the other Contracting State, shall not be subjected in the first- mentioned State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirement to which other similar enterprises of the first-mentioned State are or may be subjected.

2.	Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State - and taxes accordingly - profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits.

In such a case, the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.

5.	Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company and beneficially owned by persons who are not residents of the other State, or subject the company’s undistributed profits to a tax on undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State.

This paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid.

ARTICLE 11

Interest

3.	Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2 of this Article, interest arising in a Contracting State shall be exempt from tax in that State if it is derived and beneficially owned by the Government of the other Contracting State, an administrative-territorial unit or a local authority thereon or any agency or bank unit or instrumentality of that Government, an administrative-territorial unit or a local authority or, if the debt- claims of a resident of the other Contracting State are warranted, insured, or directly or indirectly financed by a Financial institution wholly owned by the Government of the other Contracting State, provided that the loan or debt-claim giving rise to such interest is not on commercial basis.

The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, has in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the interest is a resident, a permanent establishment or a base fixed situated therein, and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with the business carried on through such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such a case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.

5.	Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is that State itself, a political subdivision or an administrative territorial unit, a local authority or a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether he is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is borne by that permanent establishment or fixed base, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.

6.	Where, owing to a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest exceeds, for whatever reason, the amount which would have been agreed upon in absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Agreement.

7.	The provisions of this Article shall not apply if in the opinion of the competent authorities, the right of property giving rise to the interest was created or assigned mainly for the purpose of taking advantage of this Article and not for bona fide commercial reasons.

8.	The term "interest' as used in this Article means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor’s and in particular, income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, including premiums and prizes attaching to such securities. Penalty charges for late payment shall not be regarded as interest for the purpose of this Article.

ARTICLE 12

Royalties

1.	Royalties derived from a resident of a Contracting State by a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in the other State.

2.	However, such royalties may also be taxed in the Contracting State from which they are derived and according to the law of that State, but where the beneficial owner of the royalties is subject to tax thereon in the other State, the tax so charged shall not exceed twelve and a half per cent of the gross amount of the royalties.

3.	The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the royal-ties, being a resident of a Contracting State, has in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the royalties is a resident, a permanent establishment or a base fixed situated therein, and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected with the business carried on through such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such a case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.

CHAPTER IV

ARTICLE 23

Elimination of double taxation

1.	The Netherlands, when imposing tax on its residents, may include in the basis upon which such taxes are imposed the items of income which, according to the provisions of this Agreement, may be taxed in Nigeria.

2.	 However, where a resident of the Netherlands derives items of income which according to Article 6, Article 7, paragraph 4 of Article 10, paragraph 5 of Article 11, paragraph 4 of Article 12, paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 13, Article 14, Article 15, Article 16 and Article 19 of this Agreement may be taxed in Nigeria and are included in the basis referred to in paragraph 1, the Netherlands shall exempt such items of income by allowing a reduction of its tax. This reduction shall be computed in conformity with the provisions of Netherlands law for the avoidance of double taxation. For that purpose the said items of income shall be deemed to be included in the total amount of the items of income which are exempt from Netherlands tax under this provisions.

3.	Further, the Netherlands shall allow a deduction from the Netherlands tax so computed for the items of income which according to paragraph 2 of Article 10, paragraph 2 of Article 11, paragraph 2 of Article 12, paragraph 4 of Article 13, Article 17, paragraph 1 (a) and paragraph 2 of Article 18 and paragraph 2 of Arti-cle 22 of this Agreement may be taxed in Nigeria to the extent that these items are included in the basis re-ferred to in paragraph 1 of this Article. The amount of this deduction shall be equal to the tax paid in Nigeria on these items of income, but shall not exceed the amount of the reduction which would be allowed if the items of income so included were the sole items of income which are exempt from Netherlands tax under the provisions of Netherlands law for the avoidance of double taxation.

Where by reason of the relief given under the provisions of Nigerian laws for the purposes of encouraging investment in Nigeria the Nigeria tax actually levied on interest arising in Nigeria or on royalties arising in Nigeria is lower than the tax Nigeria may levy according to paragraph 2 of Article 11 and paragraph 2 of Article 12, respectively, then the amount of the tax paid in Nigeria on such interest and royalties shall be deemed to have been paid at the rates mentioned in the said provisions.

However, if the general tax rates under Nigerian laws applicable to the aforementioned interest and royalties are reduced below those mentioned in this paragraph, those lower rates shall apply for the purposes of this paragraph. The provisions of this paragraph shall only apply for a period of ten years after the date on which the Agreement became effective. This period may be extended by mutual agreement between the competent authorities.

4.	Subject to the provisions of the law of Nigeria regarding the allowance as a credit against Nigerian tax or tax payable in a territory outside Nigeria (which shall not affect the general principle hereof)—

(a)	Netherlands tax payable under laws of the Netherlands and in accordance with this Agree-ment, whether directly or by deduction, on profits, income or chargeable gains from sources within the Netherlands (excluding in the case of a dividend, tax payable in respect of the profits out of which the dividend is paid) shall be allowed as a credit against any Nigerian tax computed by reference to the same profits, income or chargeable gains by reference to which Netherlands tax is computed;

(b)	in case of a dividend paid by a company which is a resident of the Netherlands to a company which is resident in Nigeria and which controls directly or indirectly at least ten per cent of the voting power in the company paying the dividend, the credit shall take into account (in addition to any Netherlands tax for which credit may be allowed under the provisions of sub- paragraph (a) of this paragraph) the Netherlands tax payable by the company in respect of the profits out of which such dividend is paid.

For the purposes of this Article in determining the taxes on income paid to the Netherlands, the investment premiums and bonuses and disinvestments payments as meant in the Netherlands Investment Account Law (“Wet investeringsrekening”) shall not be taken into account as they do not form part of the taxes referred to in paragraphs 1 (a) and 2 of Article 2.

CHAPTER V

Special provisions

ARTICLE 24

Non-discrimination

1.

2.	The taxation on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of one of the States has in the other State shall not be less favourably levied in that other State than the taxation levied on enterprises of that other State carrying on the same activities.

5.	The provisions of this Article shall, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 2, apply to taxes of every kind and description.

ARTICLE 25

Mutual agreement procedure

The case must be presented within three years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement.

2.

(a)	to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other State;

(b)	to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other State;

ARTICLE 27

Diplomatic agents and consular officers

Protocol

At the moment of signing the Agreement for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and capital gains, this day concluded between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Federal Republic of Nigeria, the undersigned have agreed that the following provisions shall form an integral part of the Agreement.

I. AD ARTICLE 7

In respect of paragraph 1 of Article 7, profits derived from the sale of goods or merchandise of the same or similar kind as those sold, or from other business activities of the same or similar kind as those effected, through that permanent establishment, may be considered attributable to that permanent establishment. This provision will only be applicable where sales or business activities are effected by an enterprise of one of the States in the other State through other outlets or fixed points than its permanent establishment.

n. AD ARTICLE 7

Payments received as a consideration for technical services, including studies or surveys of a scientific, geological or technical nature, or for engineering contracts including blue prints related thereto, or for consultant or supervisory services shall be deemed to be profits of an enterprise to which the provisions of Article 7 apply.

III.	ARTICLE 8

If the competent authorities of the States have agreed on the basis of Article 25 that profits as meant in Article 8 are derived by an enterprise or enterprises of one of the States from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic to or from places in the other State and that such profits are not derived by an enterprise of the other State from the operation of the ships or aircraft in international traffic to or from places in the first-mentioned State and that such situation has a permanent nature, the condition of reciprocity as envisaged in paragraph 1 of Article 8 is not met and, no exemption shall be granted; in such case, the tax so charged shall be one per cent of the earnings of the enterprise derived from the other State. For the purposes of the foregoing sentence, the term 'earning' means income derived by a shipping or air transport enterprise of one of the States from the carriage of passengers, mail, livestock or goods boarded or loaded in the other State, less the refunds and payments of wages and salaries of ground staff and excluding the income derived from the carriage of passengers, mail, livestock or goods which are brought to that other State solely for transhipments or transfers.

IV.	AD ARTICLE 9

It is understood that the fact that associated enterprises have concluded arrangements, such as cost-sharing arrangements or general services agreements, for or based on the allocation of executive, general administrative, technical and commercial expenses, research and development expenses and other similar expenses, is not in itself a condition as meant in paragraph 1 of Article 9. However, this does not prevent one of the States from checking the above-mentioned arrangements for conditions as meant in paragraph 1 of Article 9.

V.	AD ARTICLES 10,11 AND 12

(i)	The competent authorities of the States shall by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of the reductions and exemptions from tax in the State of source given by Articles 10,11 and 12.

(ii)	Where tax has been levied at source in excess of the amount of tax chargeable under the provi-sions of Articles 10, 11 and 12, applications for refund of the excess amount of tax have to be lodged with the competent authority of the State having levied the tax, within a period of three years after the expiration of the calendar year in which the tax has been levied.

VI.	AD ARTICLE 13

It is understood that the terms corporate organisation, reorganisation, amalgamation, division or similar transaction refer to a transfer of shares within a group of associated enterprises. In that case the shares will be evaluated for the transferee at the book value of the transferor.

VII.	AD ARTICLE 16

It is understood that 'bestuurder' or 'commissaris' of a Netherlands company means persons who are nominated as such by the general meeting of shareholders or by any other competent body of such company and are charged with the general management of the company or the supervision thereof respectively.

VIII.	AD ARTICLE 24

It is understood that in both States, interest, royalties and other disbursement paid by an enterprise of one of the States to a resident of the other State, for the purpose of determining according to its tax legislation the taxable profits of such enterprise, are deductible in the same way as if they had been paid to a resident of the first-mentioned State. 

IN WITNESS whereof the undersigned, duly authorised thereto, have signed this Agreement. DONE at Lagos this 11 December, 1991, in duplicate, in the English language.

(2)	The profits of a company other than a Nigerian company from any trade or business shall be deemed to be derived from Nigeria—

(1)	Where a company other than a Nigerian company carries on the business of transport by sea or air, and any ship or aircraft owned or chartered by it calls at any port or airport in Nigeria, its profits or loss to be deemed to be derived from Nigeria shall be the full profits or loss arising from the carriage of passengers, mails, livestock or goods shipped, or loaded into an aircraft, in Nigeria:

Provided that this subsection shall not apply to passengers, mails, livestock or goods which are brought to Nigeria solely for trans-shipment or for transfer from one aircraft to another or in either di-rection between an aircraft and a ship.

(2)	For the purposes of the preceding subsection, where the Board is satisfied that the taxation au-thority of any other country computes and assesses on a basis not materially different from that pre-scribed by this Act the profits of a company which operates ships or aircraft, and that authority certifies—

(a)	the ratio of profits or loss, before any allowance by way of depreciation, of an accounting period to the total sums receivable in respect of the carriage of passengers, mails, livestock or goods; and

(b)	the ratio of allowances by way of depreciation for that period to that same total,

then the full profits or loss of that period shall be taken to be that proportion of the total sums receivable in respect of the carriage of passengers, mails, livestock or goods shipped or loaded in Nigeria which is produced by applying the first-mentioned ratio to that total, and in place of any allowances to be given under the provisions of the Second Schedule there shall be allowed the amount produced by applying the second-mentioned ratio to that same total.

[Second Schedule.]

(3)	Where at the time of assessment, the provisions of subsection (2) of this section cannot for any reason be satisfactorily applied, the profits to be deemed to be derived from Nigeria may be computed on a fair percentage on the full sum receivable in respect of the carriage of passengers, mails, livestock and goods shipped or loaded in Nigeria:

Provided that where any company has been assessed for any year by reference to such percentage, it shall be entitled to claim at any time within six years after the end of such year that its liability for that year be re-computed on the basis provided by subsection (2) of this section; and where such claim has been made and a certificate has been produced to the satisfaction of the Board as provided in that sub-section, such repayment of tax shall be made as may be necessary to give effect to this proviso, save that, if the company fails to agree with the Board as to the amount of the tax to be so re-computed and repaid, the Board shall give notice to the company of refusal to admit the claim and the provisions of this Act with respect to objections and appeals shall apply accordingly with any necessary modifications.

(4)	For the purposes of this section, the tax payable by any company for any year of assessment shall not be less than two per cent of the full sum receivable in respect of the carriage of passengers, mails, livestock or goods shipped or loaded into an aircraft in Nigeria.

15.	Cable undertakings

Where a company other than a Nigerian company carries on the business of transmission of messages by cable or by any form of wireless apparatus, it shall be assessable to tax as though it operates ships or aircraft, and the provisions of the preceding section shall apply mutatis mutandis to the computation of its profits deemed to be derived from Nigeria as though the transmission of messages to places outside Nigeria were equivalent to the shipping or loading of passengers, mails, livestock or goods in Nigeria.

16.	Insurance companies

(1)	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Act, insurance business shall be taxed as—

(a)	an insurance company, whether proprietary or mutual, other than a life insurance company; or

(b)	a Nigerian company whose profit accrued in part outside Nigeria,

the profit on which tax may be imposed, shall be ascertained by taking the gross premium interest and other income receivable in Nigeria less reinsurance and deducting from the balance so arrived at, a reserve for unexpired risks at the percentage consistently adopted by the company in relation to its operations as a whole for such risks at the end of the period for which the profits are being ascertained, subject to the limitation imposed in subsection (8) (a) of this section.

(2)	The profits on which tax may be imposed in an insurance company which is a life insurance company, whether proprietary or mutual, other than a Nigerian company which carries on business through a permanent establishment in Nigeria shall—

(a)	be the investment income less the management expenses, including commission, subject to the limitation imposed in subsection (8) (b) of this section; and

(b)	where the profits of the company accrue in part outside Nigeria, be that proportion of the total investment income of the company as the premium earned whether received or receivable, less the agency expenses in Nigeria and a fair proportion of expenses of the head office of the company but where the insurance company has its head office outside Nigeria the Board may substitute some basis other than that prescribed in this paragraph for ascertaining the required proportion or the total investment income.

(3)	Any amount distributed in any form as dividend from an actuarial revaluation of unexpired risks or from any other revaluation shall be deemed to be part of the total profits of the company for tax purposes.

(4)	Not more than three months after an actuarial revaluation of the unexpired risks or any other re-valuation has taken place, the Company shall provide the Board with full particulars of the revaluation carries out, including a copy of the actuary’s revaluation certificate.

(6)	Where an insurance company carries on a life class and a general class insurance business, the funds and books of accounts of one class shall be kept separate from the other as though one class does not relate to the other class, and the annual tax returns of the two classes of insurance businesses shall be made separately. 

(7)	Each class of insurance shall be assessed separately as 'life insurance assessment' and 'non-life (other) insurance assessment' and in respect of each class of insurance business where there are more than one type of insurance in the same class, they form one type of business and shall not be allowed against the income from another type of insurance business but the loss shall be available to be carried forward against profits from the same class of insurance business and, in all cases, the period of carrying forward of a loss shall be limited to four years of assessment.

(8)	An insurance company, other than a life insurance company, shall be allowed as deductions from its premium the following reserves for tax purposes—

(a)	for unexpired risks, forty-five per cent of the total premium in case of general insurance business other than marine insurance business and twenty-five per cent of the total premium in the case of marine cargo insurance;

(b)	for other reserves, claims and outgoings of the company an amount equal to twenty-five per cent of the total premium, so that, after allowance under the Second Schedule to this Act as may be restricted, has been allowed for in any year of assessment, not less than an amount equal to fifteen per cent of the total profit of the company for tax purposes.

(10)	A reinsurance company shall be allowed the following deductions from its gross profit to be credited to a general reserve fund—

(a)	an amount not more than fifty per cent of the gross profits of the reinsurer for the year where the general reserve fund is less than the initial statutory minimum authorised share capital; or

(b)	an amount not more than twenty-five per cent of the gross profit of the reinsurer for the year, where the fund is equal to or exceeds the initial statutory minimum authorised share capital.

(11)	An insurance company that engages the services of an insurance agent, a loss adjuster and an insurance broker shall include in its annual tax returns, a schedule showing the name and address of that agent, loss adjuster and insurance broker, the date their services were employed and terminated, as ap-plicable, and payments made to each such agent, loss adjuster and insurance broker for the period covered by the tax returns.

[No. 11 of 2007, s. 4.]

(EDITORIAL NOTE: Please note that although section 4 of Act No. 11 of 2007 instructs section 14 to

(a)	as if the trustees were a company whose business consists mainly in the making of investments and the principal part of whose income is derived therefrom;

(b)	as if the rights of the unit holders were shares in the company; and

[No. 63 of 1991.]

(2)	For the purpose of section 32 of this Act, the profits of an authorised unit scheme, on which tax may be imposed, shall be ascertained by taking the income accruing to the trustees from all sources of the investment of the unit trust and deducting therefrom sums disbursed as management expenses, including remuneration for the managers.

[No. 63 of 1991.]

(3)	Where the trustees of a unit trust receive a payment on which the unit trust suffers tax by deduc-tion (not being franked investment income), the tax thereon shall be set off against any income on the trustees by an assessment made for the year of assessment in which the receipt, on which the tax deduc-tion was made, falls to be taken into account in ascertaining the tax payable by the unit trust for the year of assessment.

[No. 30 of 1996.]

(a)	no total profits; or

(b)	total profits which are less than the amount of dividend which is paid, whether or not the recipient of the dividend is a Nigerian company,

is paid by a Nigerian company, the company paying the dividend shall be charged to tax at the rate pre-scribed in section 40 (1) of this Act as if the dividend is the total profits of the company for the year of assessment to which the accounts, out of which the dividend is declared, relates.

20.	Nigerian dividends received by companies other than Nigerian companies

In the case of a company which is neither a Nigerian company nor engaged in a trade or business in Nigeria at any time during a year of assessment—

(a)	no tax shall be charged on it for that year in respect of any dividend received by it from a Nigerian company apart from tax withheld under section 80 of this Act;

(c)	nothing in this Act shall confer on such company or on the company paying the dividend, a right to repayment of tax paid by reason of the provisions of this section. 

21.	Certain undistributed profits may be treated as distributed

(2)	Any amount of profits treated as distributed under the provisions of the foregoing subsection shall, for the purposes of this Act and any enactment in Nigeria imposing tax on the incomes of persons other than companies, be deemed to be profits or income from a dividend accruing to those persons who are shareholders in the company in proportion to their shares in the ordinary capital thereof on such day, and the amount of such profits or income to be taken for assessment in the hands of each such person shall be his due proportion thereof increased by such amount in respect of tax deemed to be deducted at source, as the Board may determine.

(a)	the day to be taken for the purposes of the preceding subsection;

(d)	the gross amount which, after deduction of tax at the said rate, leaves such net amount of

those profits; and

(e)     the net Nigerian rate of tax applicable to those profits, being such rate as would have been computed or agreed by the Board under the provisions of section 43 (2) of this Act if those profits had been distributed by the company as a dividend.

(4)	For the purposes of this section, the Board may give notice to any company which it has reason to believe is controlled by not more than five persons requiring it to supply, within such reasonable time limited in such notice, full particulars of its shareholders on any day.

22.	Artificial transactions, etc.

(1)	Where the Board is of opinion that any disposition is not in fact given effect to or that any transaction which reduces or would reduce the amount of any tax payable is artificial or fictitious, it may disregard any such disposition or direct that such adjustments shall be made as respects liability to tax as it considers appropriate so as to counteract the reduction of liability to tax affected, or reduction which would otherwise be affected, by the transaction and any company concerned shall be assessable accordingly.

(2)	For the purpose of this section—

(a)	"disposition' includes any trust, grant, covenant, agreement or arrangement;

(b)	transactions between persons one of whom either has control over the other or, in the case of individuals, who are related to each other or between persons both of whom are controlled by some other person, shall be deemed to be artificial or fictitious if in the opinion of the Board those transactions have not been made on terms which might fairly have been expected to have been made by persons engaged in the same or similar activities dealing with one another at arm’s length.

(3)	A company in respect of which any direction is made under this section, shall have a right of appeal in like manner as though for the purposes of Part X of this Act such direction were an assessment.

(a)	if the Commonwealth rate of tax does not exceed the rate of tax under this Act, the rate at which relief is to be given shall be one half of the Commonwealth rate of tax;

(b)	if the Commonwealth rate of tax exceeds the rate of tax under this Act, the rate at which relief is to be given shall be equal to the amount by which the rate of tax under this Act exceeds one half of the Commonwealth rate of tax.

(3)	For the purposes of this section—

'Commonwealth income tax' means any tax on income or profits of companies charged under a law in force in any country within the Commonwealth or in the Republic of Ireland which provides for relief from tax charged both in that country and Nigeria in a manner corresponding to the relief granted by this section;

'rate of tax' under this Act of a company for any year of assessment means the rate determined by dividing the amount of tax imposed for that year (before the deduction of any double taxation relief granted by this Part) by the amount of the total profits of the company for that year, and the Common-wealth rate of tax shall be determined in a similar manner.

(4)	Any claim for relief from tax for any year of assessment under this section shall be made not later than six years after the end of that year, and if the claim is admitted, the amount of the tax to be relieved shall be re-paid out of the tax paid for that year of assessment or set-off against the tax which the company is liable to pay for that year of assessment:

Provided that if the company fails to satisfy the Board as to the amount of the tax to be relieved, the Board shall give notice of refusal to admit the claim and the provisions of Part XI shall apply accordingly with any necessary modifications as though such notice were an assessment.

45.	Double taxation arrangements

(1)	If the Minister by order declares that arrangements specified in the order have been made with the Government of any country outside Nigeria with a view to affording relief from double taxation in relation to tax imposed on profits charged by this Act and any tax of a similar character imposed by the laws of that country, and that it is expedient that those arrangements should have effect, the arrangements shall have effect notwithstanding anything in this Act.

(2)	On the making of an order under this section with respect to arrangements made with the gov-ernment of any Commonwealth country or the Republic of Ireland, section 44 of this Act shall cease to have effect as respects that country and shall be deemed to have ceased to have had effect as from the beginning of the first year of assessment for which the arrangements are expressed to apply except in so far as the arrangements otherwise provide.

(3)	Where any arrangements have effect by virtue of this section, any obligation as to secrecy in this Act shall not prevent the disclosure to any authorised officer of the government with which the arrangements are made of such information as is required to be disclosed under the arrangements.

(4)	The Minister may make rules for carrying out the provisions of any arrangements having effect under this section.

(5)	An order made under the provisions of subsection (1) of this section may include provisions for relief from tax for periods commencing or terminating before the making of the order and provisions as to profits which are not themselves liable to double taxation.

46.	Method of calculating relief to be allowed for double taxation

(1)	The provisions of this section shall have effect where, under arrangements having effect under section 45 of this Act, foreign tax payable in respect of any profits in the country with the government of which the arrangements are made is to be allowed as a credit against tax payable in respect of those profits under this Act, and in this section, 'foreign tax' means any tax payable in that country which under the arrangements is to be so allowed.

(2)	The amount of the tax chargeable in respect of the profits which are liable to both tax and foreign tax shall be reduced by the amount of the credit admissible under the terms of the arrangement:

Provided that no credit shall be allowed to a company for a year of assessment unless during some part of that year it was a Nigerian company.

(3)	The credit shall not exceed the amount which would be produced by computing, in accordance with the provisions of this Act, the amount of the profits which are liable to both tax and foreign tax, and then charging that amount to tax at a rate ascertained by dividing the tax chargeable (before the deduction of any double taxation relief granted by this Part of this Act) on the total profits of the company entitled to the profits by the amount of the total profits.

(4)	Without prejudice to the provisions of subsection (3) of this section, the total credit to be allowed to a company for a year of assessment for foreign tax under all arrangements having effect under section 45 of this Act shall not exceed the total tax payable by it for that year of assessment.

(5)	In computing the amount of the profits—

(a)	no deduction shall be allowed in respect of foreign tax (whether in respect of the same or any other profits);

(b)	where tax chargeable depends on the amount received in Nigeria, the said amount shall be increased by the appropriate amount of the foreign tax in respect of the profits; and

(c)	where the profits include a dividend and under the arrangements foreign tax not chargeable directly or by deduction in respect of the dividend is to be taken into account in considering whether any, and if so what, credit is to be given against tax in respect of the dividend, the amount of the profits shall be increased by the amount of the foreign tax not so chargeable which falls to be taken into account in computing the amount of the credit, but notwithstanding anything in the preceding provisions of this subsection a deduction shall be allowed of any amount by which the foreign tax in respect of the profits exceeds the credit thereof.

(6)	Section (5) (a) and (b), but not the remainder thereof shall, apply to the computation of total profits for the purpose of determining the rate mentioned in subsection (3) of this section, and shall apply thereto in relation to all profits in respect of which credit falls to be given for foreign tax under ar-rangements for the time being in force under section 45 of this Act.

(7)	Where—

(a)	the arrangements provide, in relation to dividends of some classes but not in relation to divi-dends of other classes, that foreign tax not chargeable directly or by deduction in respect of dividends is to be taken into account in considering whether any, and if so what, credit is to be given against tax in respect of the dividends; and

(b)	a dividend is paid which is not of a class in relation to which the arrangements so provide,

then, if the dividend is paid to a company which controls, directly or indirectly, not less than one half of the voting power in the company paying the dividend, credit shall be allowed as if the dividend were a dividend of a class in relation to which the arrangements so provide.

(8)	Credit shall not be allowed under the arrangements against tax chargeable in respect of the profits of a company for any year of assessment if the company elects that credit shall not be allowed in the case of those profits for that year.

(9)	Any claim for an allowance by way of credit shall be made not later than two years after the end of assessment, and in the event of any dispute as to the amount allowable the claim shall be subject to objection and appeal in like manner as an assessment.

(10)	Where the amount of any credit given under the arrangements is rendered excessive or insuffi-cient by reason of any adjustment of the amount of any tax payable in Nigeria or elsewhere, nothing in this Act limiting the time for the making of assessments or claims for relief shall apply to any assessment or claim to which the adjustment gives rise, being an assessment or claim made not later than two years from the time when all such assessments, adjustments and other determinations have been made, whether in Nigeria or elsewhere, as are material in determining whether any, and if so what, credit falls to be given.

(b)	refuse to accept the return and, to the best of its judgement, determine the amount of the total profits of the company and make an assessment accordingly.

(3)	Where a company has not delivered a return and the Board is of the opinion that such company is liable to pay tax, the Board may, according to the best of its judgement, determine the amount of the total profits of such company and make an assessment accordingly, but such assessment shall not affect any liability otherwise incurred by such company by reason of its failure or neglect to deliver a return. 

(4)	Nothing in this section shall prevent the Board from making an assessment upon a company for any year before the expiration of the time within which such company is required to deliver a return or to give notice under the provisions of section 55 of this Act, if the Board or any officer of the Federal Inland Revenue Service duly authorised by the Board considers such assessment to be necessary for any reason of urgency.

(5)	In this section, the reference to a return shall be construed as a reference to the accounts and re-turn submitted pursuant to section 55 of this Act.

66.	Additional assessments

(1)	If the Board discovers or is of the opinion at any time that any company liable to tax has not been assessed or has been assessed at a less amount than that which ought to have been charged, the Board may, within the year of assessment or within six years after the expiration thereof and as often as may be necessary, assess such company at such amount or additional amount, as ought to have been charged, and the provisions of this Act as to notice of assessment, appeal and other proceedings shall apply to such assessment or additional assessment and to the tax charged thereunder:

Provided that where any form of fraud, wilful default or neglect has been committed by or on behalf of any company in connection with any tax imposed under this Act or under the Companies Income Tax Act, 1961 the Board may at any time and as often as may be necessary, assess such company at such amount or additional amount as may be necessary for the purpose of making good any loss of tax attributable to the fraud, wilful default or neglect.

[No. 22 of 1961.]

(2)	For the purpose of computing under subsection (1) of this section the amount or the additional amount which ought to have been charged, all relevant facts consistent with the proviso to section 76 of this Act shall be taken into account even though not known when any previous assessment or additional assessment on the same company for the same year was being made or could have been made.

[No. 30 of 1996.]

(5)	In the event of any company assessed, which has objected to an assessment made upon it, agreeing with the Board as to the amount at which it is liable to be assessed, the assessment shall be amended accordingly, and notice of the tax payable shall be served upon such company:

'basis period' has the meaning assigned to it by the following provisions of this definition—

(a) in the case of company to or on which any allowance of charge falls to be made in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule, its basis period for the year of assessment is the period by reference to the profits of which any assessable profits for that year fall to be computed under the provisions of section 29 of this Act;

(b) such profits mean profits in respect of the trade or business in which there was used an asset in connection with which such allowance or charge falls to be made:

Provided that, in the case of any such trade or business—

(i)	where two basis periods overlap, the period common to both shall be deemed, except for the purpose of making an annual allowance, to fall in the basis period ending at the earlier date and in no other basis period;

(ii)	where two basis periods coincide, they shall be treated as overlapping, and the basis period for the earlier year of assessment shall be treated as ending before the end of the basis period for the later year of assessment;

(iii)	where there is an interval between the end of the basis period for one year of assessment and the basis period for the next year of assessment, then unless the second-mentioned year of assessment is the year in which, for the purposes of section 29 (4), such company permanently ceases to carry on the trade or business, the interval shall be deemed to be part of the second basis period; and

(iv)	where there is an interval between the end of the basis period for the year of assessment preceding that in which the trade or business permanently ceases, for the purposes of section 29 (4), to be carried on by such company and the basis period for the year in which it so ceases, the interval shall be deemed to form part of the first basis period;

'concession' includes a mining right and a mining lease;

'lease' includes an agreement for a lease where the term to be covered by the lease has begun, any tenancy and any agreement for the letting or hiring out of an asset, but does not include a mortgage, and the expression 'leasehold interest' shall be construed accordingly and—

(a)	where, with the consent of the lessor, a lease of any asset remains in possession thereof after the termination of the lease without a new lease being granted to him, that lease shall be deemed for the purposes of this Schedule to continue so long as he remains in possession as aforesaid; and

(b)	where, on the termination of a lease of any asset, a new lease of that asset is granted to the lessee, the provisions of this Schedule shall have effect as if the second lease were a continuation of this first lease;

(iv)	on the acquisition of, or of rights in or over, the deposits or on the purchase of information relating to the existing and extent of the deposits;

(v)	on searching for or on discovering and testing deposits, or winning access thereto;

(i)	expenditure is incurred for the purposes of a trade or business by a company about to carry on such trade or business; and

(ii)	that expenditure is incurred in respect of an asset owned by that company if that expenditure would have fallen to be treated as qualifying expenditure if it had been incurred by that company on the first day on which it carries on that trade or business,

that expenditure shall be deemed to be qualifying expenditure incurred by it on that day;

(f) capital expenditure, that is, qualifying research and development expenditure, incurred on equipment and facilities, patents, licences, secret formula or process or for information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific process; technical feasibility of products or processes and purchases, searching for and discovering and testing products or process for future market or use; and such other similar cost which has not brought into existence any asset;

(b)	such expenditure has not brought into existence any asset; and

(c)	such trade or business consists of the working of a mine, oil well or other source of mineral deposits of a wasting nature,

(3)	So much of any qualifying mining expenditure incurred on the acquisition of rights in or over mineral deposits and on the purchase of information relating to the existence and extent of the deposits as exceeds the total of the original cost of acquisition of such rights and of the cost of searching for, discovering and testing such deposits prior to the purchase of such information, shall be left out of account for the purposes of this Schedule:

Provided that where such costs were originally incurred by a company which carried on a trade or business consisting, as to the whole or part thereof, in the acquisition of such rights or information with a view to the assignment or sale thereof, the price paid on such assignment or sale shall be substituted for the aforementioned costs.

3.	Owner and meaning of 'relevant interest'

(1)	For the purposes of this Schedule, where an asset consists of a building, structure or works, the owner thereof shall be taken to be the owner of the relevant interest in such building, structure or works.

(2)	Subject to the provisions of this paragraph, in this Schedule, the expression 'the relevant interest' means, in relation to any expenditure incurred on the construction of a building, structure or works, the interest in such building, structure or works to which the person who incurred such expenditure was entitled when he incurred it.

(3)	Where, when he incurs qualifying building expenditure or qualifying mining expenditure on the construction of a building, structure or works, a person is entitled to two or more interests therein, and one of those interests is an interest which is reversionary on all the others, that interest shall be the relevant interest for the purposes of this Schedule.

4.	Sale of buildings

Where capital expenditure has been incurred on the construction of a building, structure or works and thereafter the relevant interest therein is sold, any company which buys that interest shall be deemed, for all the purposes of this Schedule except the granting of initial allowances, to have incurred, on the date when the purchase price became payable, capital expenditure on the construction thereof equal to the price paid by it for such interest or to the original cost of construction whichever is the less:

Provided that where such relevant interest is sold before the building, structure or works has been used, the foregoing provisions of this paragraph shall have effect with respect to such sales with the omission of the words 'except the granting of initial allowances' and the original cost of construction shall be taken to be the amount of the purchase price on such sale:

Provided also that where any such relevant interest is sold more than once before the building, structure or works is used, the provisions of the foregoing proviso shall have effect only in relation to the last of those sales.

5.	Qualifying industrial building expenditure

For the purpose of this Schedule—

(a) where but for this paragraph a company is entitled to an annual allowance in respect of quali-fying building expenditure in respect of an asset in use, for the purposes of a trade or business carried on by it at the end of its basis period for any year of assessment, if that asset is an industrial building or structure in use as such at the end of its basis period for any such year then, in lieu of such allowance and qualifying building expenditure, the qualifying expenditure in respect of that asset shall be taken to mean 'qualifying industrial building expenditure' for any allowances to be made to such company, in respect of that qualifying expenditure, for that year; and

(2)	Where capital expenditure is incurred on the purchase of an asset and either purchaser is a person over whom the seller has control, or the seller is a person over whom the purchaser has control, or some other person has control over both the purchaser and the seller, then, the amount of any initial allowance to be made in respect of such expenditure shall be such an amount as the Board may determine to be just and reasonable having regard to all the circumstances relating to such asset and control:

Provided that an amount of N10 shall be retained in the accounts for tax purposes until the asset is disposed of:

Provided further that where the basis period for any year of assessment is a period of less that one year and such allowance for that year of assessment shall be proportionately reduced.

(2)	In the case of an asset in respect of which an allowance has been granted before the commencement of this sub-paragraph, an allowance shall be made in respect of the asset for the number of years which, if added to the number of years of assessment for which allowance has already been made, equals the number of years of assessment for which allowance is to be made under the provisions of sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph:

Provided that if an allowance has been made for a number of years which is equal to or more than the number of years specified under sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph, a single allowance shall be made for an amount which is N10 less than the residue of the qualifying expenditure for the year of assessment in which this sub-paragraph takes effect.

Provided that a balancing charge shall only be made in respect of such asset if immediately prior to its disposal it was in use by such owner in the trade or business for the purposes of which such qualifying expenditure was incurred and shall not exceed the total of any allowances made to such owner under the provisions of this Schedule in respect of such asset and in cases falling under paragraph 19 of the Fourth Schedule to the Personal Income Tax Act, of any deductions made under section 10 of that Act in respect of the capital cost of such asset.

[Fourth Schedule and Cap. P8.]

13.	Value of an asset

(1)	The value of an asset at the date of its disposal shall be the net proceeds of the sale thereof or of the relevant interest therein, or if it was disposed of without being sold, the amount which, in the opinion of the Board, such asset or the relevant interest therein, as the case may be, would have fetched if sold in the open market at that date, less the amount of any expenses which the owner might reasonably be expected to incur if the asset were so sold.

(2)	For the purposes of this paragraph, if an asset is disposed of in such circumstances that insurance or compensation monies are received by the owner thereof, the asset or the relevant interests therein, as the case may be, shall be treated as having been sold and as though the net proceeds of the insurance or compensation monies were the net proceeds of the sale thereof.

(3)	So much of sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph as relates to the circumstances for determining the value of an asset by reference to the disposal of such asset, other than by way of sale, shall have effect—

(a)	in relation to any asset or the relevant interest therein disposed of not being by way of bargain made at arm’s length; or

14.	Apportionment

(1)	Any reference in this Schedule to the disposal, sale or purchase of any asset includes a reference to the disposal, sale or purchase of that asset, as the case may be, together with any other asset, whether or not qualifying expenditure has been incurred on such last-mentioned asset; and where an asset is disposed of, sold, or purchased together with another asset, so much of the value of the assets as, on a just apportionment, is properly attributable to the first-mentioned asset shall, for the purposes of this Schedule, be deemed to be the value of or the price paid for that asset, as the case may be.

For the purposes of this sub-paragraph, all the assets which are purchased or disposed of in pursuance of one bargain shall be deemed to be purchased or disposed of together, notwithstanding that separate prices are or purport to be agreed for each of those assets or that there are or purport to be separate purchases or disposals of those assets.

(2)	The provisions of sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph shall apply, with any necessary modifica-tions, to the sale or purchase of the relevant interest in any asset together with any other asset or relevant interest in any other asset.

(b)	the said dates shall be taken to be the date on which such expenditure was incurred and the date on which the asset is in fact first put to use:

Provided that where any allowances have been given in consequence of this sub-paragraph and the first use to which such asset is put is not for the purposes of such trade or business, all such additional assessments shall be made as may be necessary to counteract the benefit obtained from the giving of any such allowances.

17.	Exclusion of certain expenditure

Where any company has incurred expenditure which is allowed to be deducted, in computing the profits of its trade or business under section 24 of this Act, such expenditure shall not be treated as qualifying expenditure.

18.	Application of lessors

(a)	has incurred capital expenditure in respect thereof; or

(b)	leases that asset to any person under an operating lease contract for use wholly, exclusively, necessarily and reasonably for the purpose of a trade or business carried on by such person,

the provisions of this Schedule shall apply, as though such expenditure were incurred for the purpose of a trade or business carried on by the owner or lessor and as though the owner or lessor were using the asset for the purpose of such last-mentioned trade or business in the way in which and for the period or periods during which the asset is in fact in the first-mentioned trade or business.

[No. 3 of 1993.]

(2)	Where however an asset is acquired by any hirer or lessee under a finance lease contract the terms of which provide for the transfer of ownership, risks and reward to the hirer or lessee, the provisions of this Schedule shall apply in the same way as it applies to an asset acquired by any owner or lessor of an asset for the purpose of his trade or business, but shall so apply subject to the following modifications that is to say—

[No. 3 of 1993.]

(3)	Subject to the provisions of this Schedule, where a company has incurred capital expenditure on plant and machinery or acquires same by virtue of sub-paragraph (2) of this paragraph, wholly, exclusively, necessarily and reasonably for the purpose of a trade or business carried on by it, there shall be due an in-vestment allowance of ten per cent of such expenditure.

(b)	the asset in respect of which qualifying expenditure has been incurred by the owner thereof is used partly for the purposes of a trade or business carried on by such owner and partly for other purposes.

(2)	Any allowances and any charges which would be made if both such expenditure were incurred wholly, exclusively, necessarily and reasonably for the purposes of such trade or business and such asset were used wholly and exclusively for the purposes of such trade or business shall be computed in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule.

(3)	So much of the allowances and charges computed in accordance with the provisions of sub- paragraph (2) of this paragraph shall be made as in the opinion of the Board is just and reasonable having regard to all the circumstances and to the provisions of this Schedule.

20.	Disposal without change of ownership

Where an asset in respect of which qualifying expenditure has been incurred by the owner thereof has been disposed of in such circumstances that such owner remains the owner thereof, then, for the purposes of determining whether and, if so, in what amount, any annual or balancing allowance or balancing charge shall be made to or on such owner in respect of his use of the asset after the date of such disposal—

(a)	qualifying expenditure incurred by such owner in respect of such asset prior to the date of such disposal shall be let out of account; but

21.	Meaning of 'allowances made'

Any reference in this Schedule to an allowance made includes a reference to an allowance which would be made but for an insufficiency of assessable profits against which to make it.

22.	Claims for allowances

No allowance shall be made to any company for any year of assessment under the provisions of this Schedule unless claimed by it for that year or where the Board is of the opinion that it would be reasonable and just to do so.

23.	Election in double taxation cases

(1) Where a company makes a claim to an initial or annual allowance under this Schedule in connec-tion with any trade or business, if the taxes in respect of the profits of the trade or business are the subject of an arrangement, having effect by virtue of section 45 of this Act, between Nigeria and any other territory, for relief from double taxation, it may elect, at the time of making such claim or within such reasonable time thereafter as the Board may allow, that that allowance shall be calculated at a lesser rate than that provided for in paragraph 6 or 7 of this Schedule and in making such election it shall specify the amount of such lesser rate.

(2) Where an election has been made under this paragraph, the amount of such lesser rate shall be taken to be the appropriate rate in relation to that allowance for all the purposes of this Schedule.

24.	Manner of making allowances and charges

(1) The amount of any charge to be made on a company under the provisions of this Schedule shall be made by making an addition to its assessable profits for the year of assessment for which such charge falls to be made under the provisions of this Schedule:

Provided that where any such charge falls to be made on any company for any year of assessment, whenever necessary by reason of the assessment on that company having become final and conclusive for that year or for other sufficient reason, the Board may make an additional assessment upon such company in respect of the amount of such charge.

(2)	Subject to the provisions of this paragraph, the amount of any allowance to be made to a company under the provisions of this Schedule shall be made by making a deduction from the remainder of its assessable profits for the year of assessment for which such allowance falls to be made under the provisions of this Schedule.

(3)	For the purposes of this paragraph, any such remainder for a year of assessment shall be ascertained by first giving full effect to the provisions of sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph and to the provisions of section 31 relating to the deduction of the amount of any loss.

(4)	Where full effect cannot be given to any deduction to be made under sub-paragraph (2) of this paragraph for any year of assessment owing to there being no such remainder for that year, or owing to the remainder for that year being less than such deduction, the deduction or part of the deduction to which effect has not been given, as the case may be, shall, for the purpose of ascertaining total profits (of the company entitled to such deduction) under section 31 for the following year, be deemed to be a deduction for that year, in accordance with the provisions of sub-paragraph (2) of this paragraph, and so on for succeeding years.

(5)	Where a company is entitled to a deduction under the preceding sub-paragraph, or to a deduction in respect of a balancing allowance, in respect of an asset used in a trade or business carried on by it, for a year of assessment in which that trade or business permanently ceases to be carried on by it and full effect cannot be given to any such deduction for that year owing to there being no such remainder of assessable profits for that year, or owing to the remainder of its assessable profits for that year being less than such deduction, that deduction or the part to which effect has not been given, as the case may be, may, on a claim being made by such company, be given by way of deduction from any remainder of its assessable profits for the preceding year of assessment, and so on for other preceding years, so, however, that no such deduction shall be given by virtue of this sub-paragraph for any year earlier than the fifth year before the first-mentioned year of assessment:

Provided that where any relief is given under this sub-paragraph in respect of any such deduction, the provisions of the preceding sub-paragraph shall cease to have effect in respect of that deduction for any year of assessment subsequent to the year of assessment in which such trade or business ceases.

(6)	Where any deduction falls to be given under the provisions of the preceding sub-paragraph for any preceding years of assessment, whenever necessary, by reason of any assessments for those years having become final and conclusive, or for other sufficient reason, the Board, with respect to each such year, may make such repayment or set-off of the tax, or of any part of such tax, paid or charged for any such year as may be appropriate, in lieu of making any such deduction.

(7)	In giving effect to the provisions of sub-paragraph (2) of this paragraph, the amount of capital al-lowances to be deducted from assessable profits in any year of assessment shall not exceed sixty-six and two thirds of a per cent of such assessable profits of a company, but any company in the agro-allied industry or which is engaged in the trade or business of manufacturing, shall not be affected by the restriction under this sub-paragraph.

[No. 21 of 1991.]

(8)	In this paragraph—

'company in the agro-allied industry' is a company to which section 11 (9) of this Act applies.

In such a case, the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.

4.	Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State where the payer is that State itself, a political subdivision, a local authority or a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether he is a resident of Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.

5.	Where owing to a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest exceeds, for whatever reason, the amount which would have been agreed upon in the absence of such relationship, the provision of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In that case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Agreement.

In such a case, the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.

4.	Royalties shall be deemed to be derived in a Contracting State where the payer is that State itself, a political sub-division, a local authority or a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether he is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred and such royalties are borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, such royalties shall be deemed to arise in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.

5.	Where, owing to a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person the amount of the royalties, having regard to the use, right or information for which they are paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and their beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of the Article shall apply only to the last- mentioned amount. In that case, the excess part of the payment shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Agreement.

3.	The term 'royalties' as used in this Article means payments of any kind received as a consideration for the use of or the right to use, any copyright of literary, artistic or scientific work including cinematography films and films or tapes used for radio or television broadcasting, any patent, trade mark, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or for the use of, of the right to use industrial, commercial or scientific equipment or for information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience.

Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2 of this Article, interest arising in a Contracting State shall be exempt from tax in that State if it is derived and beneficially owned by the Government of the other Contracting State, an administrative-territorial unit or a local authority thereon or any agency or bank unit or instrumentality of that Government, an administrative-territorial unit or a local authority or, if the debt- claims of a resident of the other Contracting State are warranted, insured, or directly or indirectly financed by a Financial institution wholly owned by the Government of the other Contracting State, provided that the loan or debt-claim giving rise to such interest is not on commercial basis.

In such a case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.

6.	Where, owing to a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest exceeds, for whatever reason, the amount which would have been agreed upon in absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Agreement.

7.	The provisions of this Article shall not apply if in the opinion of the competent authorities, the right of property giving rise to the interest was created or assigned mainly for the purpose of taking advantage of this Article and not for bona fide commercial reasons.

The term "interest' as used in this Article means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor’s and in particular, income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, including premiums and prizes attaching to such securities.

In such a case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.

4.	Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State where the payer is that State itself, a political sub-division or an administrative territorial unit, a local authority or a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether he is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred and such royalties are borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such royalties shall be deemed to arise in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.

5.	Where, owing to a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties having regard to the use, right or information for which they are paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Agreement.

6.	The provisions of this Article shall not apply if, in the opinion of the competent authorities, the right of property giving rise to the royalties was created or assigned mainly for the purpose of taking advantage of this Article and not for bona fide commercial reasons.

2.	Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Article, where an enterprise of one of the States, carries on business in the other State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment.

3.	In the determination of the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses shown to have been incurred for the purposes of the business of the permanent establishment, including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred, whether in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere.

Accordingly, profits from deliveries of goods, whether or not in connection with these activities, to that permanent establishment by the head office, another permanent establishment or a third person shall not be attributed to that permanent establishment. Provided such profits do not accrue in the execution of such survey, supply, installation or construction activities in the other State.

ARTICLE 23

Elimination of double taxation

1.	The Netherlands, when imposing tax on its residents, may include in the basis upon which such taxes are imposed the items of income which, according to the provisions of this Agreement, may be taxed in Nigeria.

3.	Further, the Netherlands shall allow a deduction from the Netherlands tax so computed for the items of income which according to paragraph 2 of Article 10, paragraph 2 of Article 11, paragraph 2 of Article 12, paragraph 4 of Article 13, Article 17, paragraph 1 (a) and paragraph 2 of Article 18 and paragraph 2 of Arti-cle 22 of this Agreement may be taxed in Nigeria to the extent that these items are included in the basis re-ferred to in paragraph 1 of this Article.

However, if the general tax rates under Nigerian laws applicable to the aforementioned interest and royalties are reduced below those mentioned in this paragraph, those lower rates shall apply for the purposes of this paragraph. The provisions of this paragraph shall only apply for a period of ten years after the date on which the Agreement became effective. This period may be extended by mutual agreement between the competent authorities.

4.	Subject to the provisions of the law of Nigeria regarding the allowance as a credit against Nigerian tax or tax payable in a territory outside Nigeria (which shall not affect the general principle hereof)—

(b)	in case of a dividend paid by a company which is a resident of the Netherlands to a company which is resident in Nigeria and which controls directly or indirectly at least ten per cent of the voting power in the company paying the dividend, the credit shall take into account (in addition to any Netherlands tax for which credit may be allowed under the provisions of sub- paragraph (a) of this paragraph) the Netherlands tax payable by the company in respect of the profits out of which such dividend is paid.

For the purposes of this Article in determining the taxes on income paid to the Netherlands, the investment premiums and bonuses and disinvestments payments as meant in the Netherlands Investment Account Law (“Wet investeringsrekening”) shall not be taken into account as they do not form part of the taxes referred to in paragraphs 1 (a) and 2 of Article 2.

For the purposes of the foregoing sentence, the term 'earning' means income derived by a shipping or air transport enterprise of one of the States from the carriage of passengers, mail, livestock or goods boarded or loaded in the other State, less the refunds and payments of wages and salaries of ground staff and excluding the income derived from the carriage of passengers, mail, livestock or goods which are brought to that other State solely for transhipments or transfers.

IV.	AD ARTICLE 9

It is understood that the fact that associated enterprises have concluded arrangements, such as cost-sharing arrangements or general services agreements, for or based on the allocation of executive, general administrative, technical and commercial expenses, research and development expenses and other similar expenses, is not in itself a condition as meant in paragraph 1 of Article 9. However, this does not prevent one of the States from checking the above-mentioned arrangements for conditions as meant in paragraph 1 of Article 9.

V.	AD ARTICLES 10,11 AND 12

(i)	The competent authorities of the States shall by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of the reductions and exemptions from tax in the State of source given by Articles 10,11 and 12.

(ii)	Where tax has been levied at source in excess of the amount of tax chargeable under the provi-sions of Articles 10, 11 and 12, applications for refund of the excess amount of tax have to be lodged with the competent authority of the State having levied the tax, within a period of three years after the expiration of the calendar year in which the tax has been levied.

VI.	AD ARTICLE 13

It is understood that the terms corporate organisation, reorganisation, amalgamation, division or similar transaction refer to a transfer of shares within a group of associated enterprises. In that case the shares will be evaluated for the transferee at the book value of the transferor.

VII.	AD ARTICLE 16

It is understood that 'bestuurder' or 'commissaris' of a Netherlands company means persons who are nominated as such by the general meeting of shareholders or by any other competent body of such company and are charged with the general management of the company or the supervision thereof respectively.

VIII.	AD ARTICLE 24

It is understood that in both States, interest, royalties and other disbursement paid by an enterprise of one of the States to a resident of the other State, for the purpose of determining according to its tax legislation the taxable profits of such enterprise, are deductible in the same way as if they had been paid to a resident of the first-mentioned State.
