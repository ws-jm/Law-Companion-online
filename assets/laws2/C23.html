34.	Disciplinary action while criminal proceedings pending

If criminal proceedings are instituted against an officer in any court of law, disciplinary proceedings upon any grounds involved in the criminal charge may be taken only after the conclusion of the criminal proceedings and the determination of any appeal therefrom and then only if, having regard to the provisions of regulation 39 of these Regulations, the case is one in which disciplinary proceedings may properly be taken.

35.	Interdiction: when permissible

If disciplinary proceedings for an officer’s dismissal (including any disciplinary proceedings with a view to dismissal instituted or continued in pursuance of regulation 39 of these Regulations) are instituted or are about to be instituted or if criminal proceedings are instituted against an officer, and if the Commission considers that the interests of the judicial service require that such officer should cease forthwith to exercise the powers and functions of his office, the Commission may—

(a)	if the officer holds an appointment other than a temporary appointment, interdict him; or

(b)	if the officer holds a temporary appointment, terminate his appointment by payment of the appropriate remuneration in lieu of notice, but if such criminal proceedings result in his ac-quittal or such disciplinary proceedings (including any disciplinary proceedings with a view to dismissal instituted or continued in pursuance of regulation 41 of these Regulations) result otherwise than in his dismissal, he shall be re-engaged with effect from the date of such result or from the date following the expiration of the period for which he was paid remuneration in lieu of notice, whichever is the earlier.

(2)	Where the Chief Justice or the President or the Chief Judge, as the case may be is satisfied, after considering the report and recommendations of the Chief Registrar, that an officer should be interdicted under regulation 35 of these Regulations, he may order the officer to cease to exercise any of his powers and functions and the Chief Justice or the President or the Chief Judge, as the case may be, shall cause the case to be reported to the Commission which may confirm or otherwise deal with it.

(3)	If an officer is interdicted he shall be informed that he has been interdicted and the interdiction shall date from the time he is so informed. 

(4)	If the criminal proceedings against an interdicted officer result in his acquittal or if the disciplinary proceedings against him (including any disciplinary proceedings with a view to dismissal instituted or continued in pursuance of regulation 39 of these Regulations) result otherwise than in his dismissal, he shall be reinstated in his office by the disciplinary authority with effect from the date of such result.

37.	Officer not to leave his station without permission

(1)	Any officer who is under interdiction shall not leave his station without the permission of the chairman, and shall keep the Chief Registrar informed of the address at which instructions to him can be delivered; if he fails to comply with instructions delivered at such address within twenty-four hours of such delivery, he shall be regarded as being absent from duty without leave.

(2)	Where an officer under interdiction has received permission from the chairman to leave his sta-tion, any conditions imposed by the chairman in respect of his so leaving shall be complied with by him and failure to do so may be dealt with as misconduct for which disciplinary proceedings may be instituted under these Regulations.

38.	Salary during interdiction

(1)	An officer who is under interdiction shall, subject to the provisions of regulation 40 of these Regulations, receive such salary, not being less than half his salary, as the Commission shall think fit.

39.	Disciplinary procedure after acquittal or discharge on a criminal charge

(1)	An officer acquitted of a criminal charge in any court of law shall not be dismissed or otherwise punished on any charge upon which he has been acquitted, but nothing in this Regulation shall prevent his being dismissed or otherwise punished on any other charge arising out of his conduct in the matter, unless such charge raises substantially the same issues as those on which he has been acquitted.

(2)	In the event of the acquittal, or of the discharge, whether amounting to an acquittal or not, of an officer who has been charged with a criminal offence the Chief Registrar shall consider whether he should recommend the institution or continuance of disciplinary proceedings against such officer, but before recommending the institution or continuance of disciplinary proceedings in pursuance of this Regulation he shall, after consultation with the Chief Justice or the President or the Chief Judge, as the case may be, refer the matter to the Solicitor-General of the Federation for an opinion as to whether or not disciplinary proceedings can properly be instituted or continued under these Regulations.

(3)	In the event of a discharge which does not amount to an acquittal the Chief Registrar shall, before referring the matter to the Solicitor-General as provided under sub-regulation (2) of this Regulation, ascertain from the Director of Public Prosecutions of the Federation that further criminal proceedings against the officer are not proposed.

40.	No payment of salary on conviction

An officer adjudged by a court of law to be guilty of a criminal offence shall not receive any emoluments from the date of such judgment, pending the decision of the Commission.

41.	Disciplinary action after conviction

If an officer is convicted of a criminal offence the Chief Registrar shall make a recommendation to the Commission as to whether the officer should be dismissed or subjected to some lesser penalty on account of his conviction for the offence of which he has been adjudged guilty, and shall submit with his recommendation a copy of the charge or charges and of the judgment (and the proceedings of the court, if they are available at the time he makes his recommendations, and if they are not, and if the

Commission asks to see them, when they become available) and the Commission may inflict such pun-ishment upon the officer as may seem proper to the Commission without following the procedure pre-scribed in regulation 44,46 or 48 of these Regulations.

42.	Absence without leave or reasonable cause

(1)	Without prejudice to the power to institute disciplinary proceedings in respect of any absence from duty without leave or reasonable cause, where an officer is absent from duty without leave or rea-sonable cause, the Commission may dismiss him without following the procedure prescribed in regulation 44 of these Regulations.

(2)	An officer shall be considered and treated for all purposes as having been dismissed from service by the very fact, and from the very date, of his having committed any of the following acts or omissions—

(ia)	absenting himself from duty without leave or reasonable cause and in circumstances evincing

an intention on his part no longer to continue in the service; or

{b) resigning or purporting to resign his appointment without having first given due notice, and serving for the period of the notice of such resignation, or else paying in lieu thereof in ac-cordance with the provisions applicable in the circumstance:

Provided that if the officer concerned can later satisfy the Commission that the circumstances of his having committed any of the acts or omissions aforementioned do not justify his dismissal from the judicial service, the Commission may, without prejudice to the power to institute disciplinary proceedings in respect of such acts or omissions and with a view to a lesser punishment than dismissal being imposed, revoke the dismissal.

{d) to defer or withhold increments, without proceedings under regulation 47 of these Regulations or in pursuance of regulation 50 of these Regulations.

44.	Procedure for dismissal of officers

(1)	Whenever the Chief Justice or the President or the Chief Judge, as the case may be, considers it necessary to institute disciplinary proceedings against an officer and he is of the opinion that the mis-conduct alleged against the officer is such as would, if proved, justify the officer’s dismissal from the service, the following provisions shall apply—

(a)	the Chief Registrar shall prepare and forward to the officer a brief statement of the facts on which the allegation against him is based and shall call on him to state in writing before a day to be specified (which day shall allow a reasonable interval for the purpose) any grounds upon which he relies to exculpate himself;

number, to hold an inquiry into the matter provided that the Chief Registrar shall not be a member of the Committee.

(3)	In the event of a Committee being appointed as stated in sub-regulation (2) (c) of this Regulation—

(a)	the committee shall inform the accused officer that on a specified day the charge against him will be investigated by them and that he will be allowed or, if the Committee shall so determine, will be required, to appear before them to defend himself;

(g)	the Commission after considering the report and any further evidence before it shall then decide on the guilt or responsibility of the officer on the allegations made against him and if the officer is not exonerated shall decide on the punishment to be inflicted and the decision on each allegation made against the accused officer (but not the reasons for the decision) shall be communicated to him.

45.	Removal for general inefficiency arising from proceedings instituted for dismissal

On completion of proceedings instituted for the dismissal of an officer, the Commission may, if of opinion that the officer does not deserve to be dismissed but that the proceedings disclosed grounds for removing him on account of general inefficiency in the performance of his duties, terminate his appointment.

46.	Documentary evidence and supplying of copies of evidence

(1)	No documentary evidence shall be used at or for the purpose of an inquiry under regulation 44 of these Regulations without the accused officer having first had, a reasonable time beforehand, an op-portunity to receive a copy thereof, for which copy no charge shall be made, or an opportunity of access thereto.

(2)	After an inquiry has been closed, the accused officer may be given a copy of the record of the evidence led (including copies of documents tendered in evidence) on payment of such amount as the Commission may specify, regard being had to the labour and cost of producing such document.

47.	Procedure for lesser punishment than dismissal of officer

Where the Chief Justice or the President or the Chief Judge, as the case may be, considers it necessary to institute disciplinary proceedings against an officer and is of the opinion that the misconduct alleged against the officer is not such as would, if proved, justify the officer’s dismissal from the service, the following provisions shall apply—

{a) the Chief Registrar shall, on the direction of the Chief Justice or the President or the Chief Judge, as the case may be, report the case together with a statement of his opinion and the reasons for it to the Commission;

49.	Procedure for removal for inefficiency

Before making recommendation to the Commission that an officer should be removed from the public service of the Federation or otherwise dealt with on grounds of inefficiency, the Chief Registrar shall prepare a statement as to the officer’s general standard of efficiency and shall afford him an opportunity of considering the statement and showing cause why he should not be removed from the public service of the Federation or otherwise dealt with on grounds of inefficiency:

Provided that nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the Commission from ordering the removal from the judicial service, on grounds of inefficiency, of an officer who has been confirmed in a pensionable office where the Commission is of opinion upon the completion of proceedings instituted for the dismissal of the officer that the officer does not deserve to be dismissed but that the proceedings disclose grounds for removing him on account of inefficiency, in which event it shall not be necessary to comply with the main provisions of this Regulation.

50.	Deferring or withholding of increments

(i)	where an officer’s probationary period has been reduced to less than two years or where a contract officer is appointed for a shorter period than two years, the number of reports to be rendered on periods of six month’s service shall be correspondingly reduced and references to a final report shall be construed accordingly, so that in any case a final report shall be rendered not later than two months before a probationary period or four months before a period of contract service is to expire;

(ii)	where an officer’s probationary period has been extended beyond two years, a separate report, to be known as an Additional Performance Evaluation Report, shall be rendered, not later than six weeks after the end of the period to which it relates, on each period of six months’ service under such extension.

59.	Annual Performance Evaluation Reports

(1) Annual Performance Evaluation Reports shall be rendered on every officer who—

(a) holds an office to which this Part of these Regulations applies; and

(ib)	is not an officer in respect of whom regulation 58 (1) of these Regulations requires a Per

formance Evaluation Report to be rendered or an officer holding a temporary appointment:

Provided that it shall not be necessary to render an Annual Performance Evaluation Report in respect of an officer on whom a Performance Evaluation Report has been rendered less than four months before the end of the period for which an Annual Performance Evaluation Report would have been required.

(2)	Annual Performance Evaluation Reports on officers shall be rendered to the Commission by the Chief Registrar and in such form as the Commission may prescribe.

(3)	The procedure for the rendering of Annual Performance Evaluation Reports on officers shall be as follows—

(a)	an Annual Performance Evaluation Report shall be rendered in respect of each period of twelve months ending on 31 December, or subject to the proviso to sub-regulation (1) of this Regulation, any part of that period during which an officer has held an office in respect of which sub-regulation (1) of this Regulation requires that an Annual Performance Evaluation Report shall be rendered on him to the Commission;

(b)	in the first week of January each year, or earlier if he will then be on leave or if the Chief Registrar requires him to take earlier action, every officer on whom an Annual Performance Evaluation Report is required by this Regulation shall complete, sign and date the part he is required to complete of the prescribed number of copies of prescribed forms and, if he is the Chief Registrar, shall deliver the copies to the Chief Justice or the President or the Chief Judge, as the case may be or, if he is not, shall deliver them to the officer to whom he is immediately responsible;

(c)	an officer required by regulation 61 of these Regulations to write a report may require other officers to provide written material for a report on the officer on whom the report is required;

(d)	the prescribed number of copies of the report duly completed as required by regulation 61 of these Regulations shall be delivered to the Commission not later than 1 January following the period in respect of which the report is rendered.

Special Performance Evaluation Reports and Supplementary Performance Evaluation Reports shall be rendered on any officer at any time at the request of the Commission or of the Chief Registrar and shall have such title and be in such form as the Commission may prescribe.

61.	By whom reports to Commission to be written

(1)	Performance Evaluation Reports rendered to the Commission shall be written by the immediate su-pervisor of the officer reported upon and (except in the case of the Chief Registrar) by the Chief Registrar.

(2)	Where the holder of an office charged with responsibility for writing a Performance Evaluation Report knows that he will be temporarily absent from such office at the time a report is due to be written, he shall write the report and submit it as these Regulations may require before he leaves his office.

(3)	Where posting to an office, the substantive holder of which is charged with responsibility for writing a Performance Evaluation Report, would result in an officer assuming responsibility within the last one-third of the period to which the report is to relate for writing a report on another officer of whom he has had no official knowledge immediately prior to his own posting, the officer vacating the office shall write the report before he leaves and shall deliver it to the officer who succeeds him, and the latter officer shall submit the report when it becomes due with such signed alterations, if any, as he shall think fit.

(4)	Where the posting of an officer would result in another officer assuming, after the beginning of the period to which the report is to relate, responsibility for writing upon such officer as is first mentioned, and neither sub-regulation (2) nor (3) of these Regulations applies, any other officer under whom the officer to be reported on served for one-third or more of the period, and who would have been responsible for writing the report had the officer to be reported on continued to serve under him shall, at the request of the officer assuming responsibility, provide that officer with written material for a report on the officer to be reported on (in which case the fact that such comments have been taken into account shall be recorded in the report) or shall, if so requested by the Chief Registrar, write the report.

(5)	Where an officer assumes responsibility within the last one-third of the period to which the report is to relate for writing a report on another officer of whom he has had no official knowledge immediately prior to his own posting, the officer vacating the office shall write the report before he leaves and shall deliver it to the officer who succeeds him, and the latter officer shall submit the report when it becomes due with such signed alterations, if any, as he shall think fit.

(6)	Where it is impossible to comply with sub-regulation (1) or (2) of this Regulation and compliance with sub-regulation (3), (4) or (5) of this Regulation would be inappropriate, the Chief Registrar shall after consultation with the Chief Justice or the President or the Chief Judge, as the case may be, make what appears to him to be the most suitable arrangement possible for the writing of a report and the circumstances shall be explained in the report.

62.	Reports on officers on training courses

Where an officer has, during a period or part of a period in respect of which a Performance Evaluation Report is to be rendered, been absent from his office for the purpose of training, the Chief Registrar may obtain such reports from the authorities in charge of such training as may facilitate the writing of a Performance Evaluation Report in compliance as nearly as possible with these Regulations.

63.	Reports to be dated and signed

Every Performance Evaluation Report (including any endorsement of or alteration in or addition to a report) shall be dated and shall be signed in full by the Reporting Officer who shall append his rank or acting rank below his signature.

64.	Communication of Reports to officers; comments and discussion with officer

The Performance Evaluation Report on an officer’s work and conduct shall be signed by him to in-dicate that he has seen it and he may make in the prescribed manner such comments on the report as he thinks fit and such comments shall be discussed with him by the Reporting Officer or the Chief Registrar, as the case may be.

65.	Custody and transmission of Reports and retention of copies

(1)	An officer who is writing, has written, or has custody of a Performance Evaluation Report, or to whom a report is delivered, or into whose possession a report comes in any manner whatsoever, shall en-sure that it is seen or retained only by the authority to which it is rendered in accordance with these Regu-lations, or by an officer authorised by the Chief Registrar acting in accordance with sub-regulation (3) of this Regulation, to see or retain it, as the case may be.

(2)	An officer sending a Performance Evaluation Report to the Commission or to another officer shall cover, address and transmit it in such a manner as shall ensure that it is not seen by any person who has not been authorised to see it by the Commission or by the officer to whom it is addressed.

(3)	No copy of a Performance Evaluation Report shall be retained by a Reporting Officer: 

Provided that the Chief Registrar may retain one copy of any report rendered to the Commission on an officer on condition that he arranges for the custody under his personal supervision of such reports in such manner as shall ensure compliance with sub-regulation (1) of this Regulation.

66.	Official testimonials

The Chief Registrar may, subject to the Commission’s approval of the terms of any testimonial relating to an officer, issue official testimonials to prospective employers of officers or former officers at the request of such prospective employers but shall issue to an officer or a former officer himself only the Certificate of Service under regulation 67 of these Regulations.

Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria {Promulgation) Act - Subsidiary Legislation

69.	Removal and discipline of judicial officers

(1)	Whenever the Chief Justice or the President or the Chief Judge, as the case may be, is of the opin-ion that disciplinary proceedings ought to be instituted against a judicial officer (other than the Chief Jus-tice of Nigeria) with a view to the Commission making a recommendation to the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria for his removal from office in accordance with the provisions of section 256 (1) (b) of the Constitution, or with a view to the Commission imposing some other disciplinary measure on him for misconduct or breach of the Code of Conduct, the following provisions shall apply—

(EDITORIAL NOTE: Wording as per Gazette. This sub-regulation refers to

section 256 (1) (b), however, this section was not published in this Act.)

(2)	A recommendation shall not be made to the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria for the removal of a judicial officer from office unless the Commission is satisfied after due enquiry that the judicial officer is unable to discharge the functions of his office or appointment (whether arising from infirmity of mind or body) or that he is guilty of misconduct or contravention of the Code of Conduct.

(3)	Misconduct for which disciplinary action may be instituted includes such misconduct or misbe-haviour which in the opinion of the Commission is incompatible with a judicial office or unbecoming of the holder of such office.

[No. 21 of 1990.]

(2)	Where under these Rules any person has given an address for service, any notice or other written communication which is not required to be served personally shall be sufficiently served upon him if it is left at that address or sent by registered post to that address, and in any case where the date of service by post is material, section 26 of the Interpretation Act shall apply.

[Cap. 123.]

(3)	Where under these Rules any notice or other application to the Court, or to the court below, is required to have an address for service endorsed on it, it shall not be deemed to have been properly filed unless such an address is endorsed on it.

(4)	Any person desiring to change his address for service shall notify the Registrar, who shall thereupon communicate the new address for service to anyone to who he may have communicated the former address.

2.	Duty of legal practitioner where he no longer acts for parties

Where any person has given the address of a legal practitioner as his address for service and the legal practitioner is not or has ceased to be instructed by him for the purpose of the proceedings concerned, it shall be the duty of the legal practitioner to inform the Registrar as soon as may be that he is not or no longer authorised to accept service on behalf of such person, and if he omits to do so he may be ordered to pay any costs occasioned thereby.

3.	Personal service: where necessary

(1) Except as may be otherwise provided in these Rules or in any other written law, no notice or other written communication in proceedings in the original or appellate jurisdiction of the Court, need be served personally except—

{a) in proceedings in the original jurisdiction of the Court, the writ of summons or other documents issued by the Court for the institution of the proceedings; and

(b)	in proceedings in the appellate jurisdiction of the Court, the notice of appeal:

Provided that if the Court is satisfied that the notice of appeal has in fact been served in the manner prescribed by sub-rule (2) of this Rule, and communicated to the respondent, no objection to the hearing of the appeal shall lie on the ground only that the notice of appeal was not served personally.

(2) Where any document is required by these Rules to be served personally, it shall be sufficiently served if it is served in the manner prescribed by law for the personal service of a writ of summons issued by the Federal High Court and if it appears to the Court that for any reason personal service cannot be conveniently effected, the Court shall have the same power as that High Court to direct that service be effected in some other way.

4.	Service of notice of appeal

The Registrar of the court below shall, after the notice of appeal has been filed, cause to be served a true copy thereof upon each of the parties mentioned in the notice of appeal. It shall not be necessary to serve any party not directly affected:

Provided that in criminal cases, service on the Attorney-General of the Federation or on the At-torney-General of a State (as the case may require) shall be deemed to be good and sufficient service on the respondent in a criminal appeal other than an appeal in a private prosecution.

5.	Filing of address for service

(1)	Every person who by virtue of service on him of a notice of appeal becomes a respondent to any appeal or intended appeal shall within thirty days after service on him of the notice of appeal file with the Registrar of the court below notice of a full and sufficient address for service in such number of copies as the said Registrar shall require and the Registrar of the court below shall forthwith send a copy of the no-tice of address to the Registrar and shall cause a copy thereof to be served on the appellant.

(2)	Such notice may be signed by the respondent or the legal practitioner representing him.

(3)	If any respondent fails or omits to file such notice of address for service, then delivery of any document or proceedings at the address shown in the notice of appeal shall be deemed to be good and proper service on him.

6.	Service on Government, Minister or the Attorney-General

[No. 21 of 1990.]

(2)	Every application for an order for leave to serve a summons on a defendant out of the jurisdiction shall be supported by evidence by affidavit or otherwise showing in what place or country such defendant is or probably may be found, and the grounds upon which the application is made.

(3)	Any order giving leave to effect service out of the jurisdiction shall prescribe the mode of service, and shall limit a time after such service within which such defendant is to enter an appearance, such time to depend on the place or country where or within which the summons is to be served, and the Court may receive an affidavit or statutory declaration of such service having been effected as prima facie evidence thereof.

8.	Title of proceedings

Notices of appeal, applications for leave to appeal, briefs and all other documents whatsoever pre-pared in pursuance of the appellate jurisdiction of the Court for filing in accordance with the provisions of these Rules, shall reflect the same title as that which obtained in the court of trial.

[G.N. Ill of 1991.]

9.	Preliminary objections

(1)	A respondent intending to rely upon a preliminary objection to the hearing of the appeal shall give the appellant three clear days’ notice thereof before the hearing, setting out the grounds of objection, and shall file such notice together with ten copies thereof with the Registrar within the same time.

(2)	If the respondent fails to comply with this Rule, the Court may refuse to entertain the objection or may adjourn the hearing thereof at the cost of the respondent or may make such other order as it thinks fit.

(3)	No objection shall be taken to the hearing of an appeal on the ground that the amounts fixed by the Registrar of the court below under rule 3 (1) of Order VII were incorrectly assessed.

10.	Declaration by party not appearing

At any time before hearing of the appeal any party to the appeal may file a declaration in writing that he does not wish to be present in person or represented by a legal practitioner on the hearing of the appeal, and he shall serve a copy of such declaration upon every other party who has filed an address for service and thereupon the appeal shall be dealt with as if the party had appeared.

11.	Non-appearance of appellant or respondent

(1)	Subject to the provisions of these Rules, if the appellant fails to appear when his appeal is called on for hearing the appeal may be dismissed with or without costs as the case may be and if the respondent fails to appear the Court may proceed to hear the appeal ex parte.

(2)	When an appeal has been dismissed under this Rule, the Court may, in civil proceedings on such terms as to costs or otherwise as it may deem just, direct the appeal to be re-entered for hearing.

(3)	Where an appeal has been heard ex parte under this Rule and any judgment has been given therein adverse to the respondent, he may apply to the Court and the Court may, in civil proceedings, set aside such judgment and rehear the appeal.

(4)	No application to set aside and rehear under this Rule shall be made after the expiration of twenty-one days from the date of the judgment sought to be set aside:

Provided that a respondent who has failed within the aforesaid period to make application under this Rule may, nevertheless at any time within a further period of three months thereafter, apply to the Court on notice to the appellant to set aside such judgment, and the Court may, where exceptional cir-cumstance is shown, grant the application and make such order in relation thereto or as to costs as it may deem fit in the circumstances. 

(5)	Any application under sub-rules (3) and (4) of this Rule shall be by motion accompanied by an affidavit setting forth the reasons and grounds for the application and a brief of argument filed simulta-neously. The court may, acting under sub-rule (3) of this Rule set aside the judgment and order the appeal to be reheard at such time and upon such conditions as to costs or otherwise as it may think fit.

[G.N. Ill of 1991.]

12.	Procedure for receiving further evidence on appeal

(1)	A party who wishes the Court to receive the evidence of witnesses (whether they were or were not called at the trial) or to order the production of any document, exhibit or other thing connected with the proceedings in accordance with the provisions of section 33 of the Act, shall apply for leave on notice of motion prior to the date set down for the hearing of the appeal.

(2)	The application shall be supported by affidavit of the facts on which the party relies for making it and of the nature of the evidence or the document concerned.

13.	Fees generally

(1)	As early as possible before the date set down for the hearing of the appeal, and in any event, not later than one week before such date, the party who has filed a brief or the legal practitioner representing him shall forward to the Registrar in charge of litigation a list of the law reports, text books and other authorities which counsel intend to cite at the hearing of the appeal.

8.	Oral argument

(1)	Subject to the provisions of rule 3 of these Rules, oral argument will be allowed at the hearing of the appeal to emphasise and clarify the written argument appearing in the briefs already filed in court.

(7)	When an appeal is called, and it is discovered that a brief has been filed for only one of the par-ties and neither of the parties concerned nor their legal practitioners appear to present oral argument, the appeal shall be regarded as having been argued on that brief.

9.	Failure to file brief within time

If an appellant fails to file and serve his brief within the time provided for in rule 5 of these Rules, or within the time as extended by the Court, the respondent may apply to the Court for the appeal to be struck out for want of prosecution. If the respondent fails to file his brief, he will not be heard in oral argument except by leave of the Court.

[G.N. Ill of 1991.]

10.	Power of Court to accelerate hearing in exceptional circumstances

21.	Default by third party

If a third party duly served with a third party notice does not enter an appearance or makes default in filing any pleading which he has been ordered to file, he shall be deemed to admit any claim stated in the third party notice and shall be bound by any judgment given in the action, whether by consent or otherwise, and by any decision therein or any question specified in the action, and when contribution or indemnity or other relief for remedy is claimed against him in the notice, he shall be deemed to admit his liability in respect of the contribution or indemnity or other relief or remedy.

(a)	where the liability of the third party to the defendant giving the notice is established on the hearing of the application, order such judgment as the nature of the case may require to be entered against the third party in favour of the defendant giving the notice; or

(b)	if satisfied that there is a question or issue properly to be tried as between the plaintiff and the defendant and the third party or between any or either of them as to the liability of the de-fendant to the plaintiff or as to the liability of the third party to make any contribution or in-demnity claimed, in whole or in part, or as to any other relief or remedy claimed in the notice by the defendant or that a question or issue stated in the notice should be determined not only as between the plaintiff and the defendant but as between the plaintiff, the defendant and the third party or any or either of them, order that question or issue to be tried in such manner as the Court or Judge in Chambers may direct; or

(c)	dismiss the application.

25.	At trial or after

ORDER XXIV

The undefended list

1.	Undefended list: affidavit

Whenever application is made to a Court for the issue of a writ of summons in respect of a claim to recover a debt or liquidated money demand and the application is supported by an affidavit setting forth the grounds upon which the claim is based and stating that in the deponent’s belief there is no defence thereto, the Court shall, if satisfied that there are grounds for believing that there is no defence thereto, enter the suit for hearing in what shall be called the 'Undefended List”, and mark the writ of summons accordingly, and enter thereon a date for hearing suitable to the circumstances of the particular case.

2.	Copy of affidavit to be served

There shall be delivered by the plaintiff to the Registrar upon the issue of the writ of summons as aforesaid, as many copies of the above-mentioned affidavit as there are parties against whom relief is sought, and the Registrar shall annex one such copy to each copy of the writ of summons for service.

3.	Notice of intention to defend

(1)	If the party served with the writ of summons and affidavit delivers to the Registrar, not less than five days before the day fixed for hearing, a notice in writing that he intends to defend the suit together with an affidavit disclosing a defence on the merit, the Court may give him leave to defend upon such terms as the Court may think just.

(2)	Where leave to defend is given under this Rule, the action shall be removed from the Undefended List and placed on the ordinary Cause List and the Court may order pleadings, or proceed to hearing without further pleadings.

4.	Judgment in undefended suit

Where any defendant neglects to deliver the notice of defence and affidavit prescribed by rule 3(1) of this Order, or is not given leave to defend by the Court, the suit shall be heard as an undefended suit, and judgment given thereon, without calling upon the plaintiff to summon witnesses before the Court to prove his case formally.

(2)	A point of law so raised may, by consent of the parties, or by order of the Court or a Judge in Chambers on the application of either party, be set down for hearing and disposed of at any time before the trial.

3.	Dismissal of action

If, in the opinion of the Court or a Judge in Chambers the decision of the point of law substantially disposes of the whole action, or of any distinct cause of action, ground of defence, set-off, counterclaim, or reply therein, the Court or Judge in Chambers may thereupon dismiss the action or make such other order therein as may be just.

4.	Striking out pleading where no reasonable cause of action disclosed

The Court or a Judge in Chambers may order any pleading to be struck out on the ground that it dis-closes no reasonable cause of the action or defence being shown by the pleadings to be frivolous or vexatious, the Court or a Judge in Chambers may order the action to be stayed or dismissed, or judgment to be entered accordingly, as may be just.

5.	Declaratory j udgment

No action or proceeding shall be open to objection on the ground that a merely declaratory judgment or order is sought thereby, and the Court may make binding declarations of right whether any consequential relief is or could be claimed or not.

ORDER XXVI

Pleadings

1.	Service of statement of claim

Unless the Court gives leave to the contrary or a statement of claim is endorsed on the writ, the plain-tiff shall serve a statement of claim together with copies of documentary evidence therein mentioned on the defendant, or, if there are two or more defendants, on each defendant, and shall do so either when the writ, or notice of the writ, is served on the defendant unless the Court or Judge in Chambers otherwise orders.

2.	Service of defence

(1)	Subject to sub-rule (2) of this Rule, a defendant who enters an appearance in, and intends to de-fend, an action shall, unless the Court gives leave to the contrary, serve a defence which must include any preliminary objection he wishes to raise to the plaintiffs action together with copies of the documentary evidence therein mentioned on the plaintiff at the time he files his memorandum of appearance.

(2)	If a summons under Order XXIV rule 1 of these Rules is served on a defendant, sub-rule (1) of this Rule shall not have effect in relation to him unless by the order of Court made on a motion on notice he is given leave to defend the action and, in that case, shall have effect as if it required him to serve his defence within fourteen days after the making of the order or within such other period as may be specified in the order.

3.	Service of reply and defence to counterclaim

(1)	Where a plaintiff serves both a reply and a defence to counterclaim on any defendant, he shall include them in the same document.

4.	Pleading to state material facts and not evidence

(1)	Every pleading shall contain a statement in a summary form of the material facts on which the party pleading relies for his claims or defence, as the case may be, but not the evidence by which they are to be proved, and shall when necessary be divided into paragraphs, and numbered consecutively.

(2)	Dates, sums and numbers shall be expressed in figures but may also be expressed in words.

(3)	Pleadings shall be signed by a legal practitioner, or by the party if he sues or defends in person.

In all cases in which the party pleading relies on any misrepresentation, fraud, breach of trust, wilful default, or undue influence, and in all other cases in which particulars may be necessary, particulars (with dates and items if necessary) shall be stated in the pleadings.

6.	Matters which must be specifically pleaded

(1)	A party shall plead specifically any matter (for example, performance, release, any relevant statute of limitation, fraud or any fact showing illegality) which, if not specifically pleaded might take the opposite party by surprise.

(2)	Any condition precedent, the performance or occurrence of which is intended to be contested, shall be distinctly specified in his pleading by the plaintiff or the defendant, as the case may be; and, subject thereto, an averment of the performance or occurrence of all conditions precedent necessary for the case of the plaintiff or the defendant shall be implied in his pleading.

(3)	Without prejudice to sub-rule (1) of this Rule, a defendant in an action for the recovery of land shall plead specifically every ground of defence on which he relies and a plea that he is in possession of the land by himself or his tenant is not sufficient.

7.	Further and better statement or particulars

(1)	A further and better statement of the nature of the claim or defence, or further and better par-ticulars of any matter stated in any pleading, notice or written proceeding requiring particulars, may in all cases be ordered, upon such terms as to costs and otherwise, as may be just.

8.	Order for particulars not a stay

(1)	The party at whose instance particulars have been filed under a Judge’s order shall, unless the order otherwise provides, have the same length of time for pleading after the service of the particulars upon him that he had initially.

(2)	Except as provided in this Rule, an order for particulars shall not, unless the order otherwise provides, operate as a stay of proceedings or give any extension of time.

9.	Specific denial

Every allegation of fact in any pleading, not being a petition or summons, if not denied specifically or by necessary implication, or stated to be not admitted in the pleading of the opposite party, shall be taken to be admitted, except as against an infant, lunatic, or person of unsound mind not adjudged a lunatic.

10.	Denial by joinder of issue

(1)	If there is no reply to a defence, there is an implied joinder of issue on that defence.

(2)	Subject to sub-rule (3) of this Rule—

(b)	a party may in his pleadings expressly join issue on the last preceding pleading.

(3)	 There shall be no joinder of issue, implied or expressed, on a statement of claim or counterclaim.

(4)	A joinder of issue operates as a denial of every material allegation of fact made in the pleading on which there is an implied or express joinder of issue unless, in the case of an express joinder of issue, any such allegation is excepted from the joinder and is stated to be admitted, in which case, the express joinder of issue operates as a denial of every other such allegation.

11.	Pleadings to be consistent

No pleading, not being a petition or summons, shall, except by way of amendment, raise any new ground of claim or contain any allegation of fact inconsistent with the previous pleadings of the party pleading the same.

12.	Grounds of claim founded on separate facts to be separately stated

(1)	Where the plaintiff seeks relief in respect of several distinct claims or causes of complaint founded upon separate and distinct facts, they shall be stated, as far as may be, separately and distinctly.

(2)	The same rule shall apply where the defendant relies upon several distinct grounds of set-off or counterclaim founded upon separate and distinct facts.

The relief claimed to be stated

(3)	Every statement of claim shall state specifically the relief which the plaintiff claims, either simply or in the alternative, and may also ask for general relief and the same rule shall apply to any counterclaim made or relief claimed by the defendant in his defence.

13.	Allegations shall not be made generally but specifically

It shall not be sufficient to deny generally the facts alleged by the statement of claim, but the defendant shall deal specially with them, either admitting or denying the truth of each allegation of fact seriatim, as the truth or falsehood of each is within his knowledge, or (as the case may be) stating that he does not know whether any given allegation is true or otherwise.

14.	Denial of fact must answer point of substance

(1)	When a party denies all allegation of fact he shall not do so evasively, but shall answer the point of substance.

(2)	When a matter of fact is alleged with diverse circumstances it shall not be sufficient to deny it as alleged along with those circumstances, but a full and substantial answer shall be given. 

15.	Admissions

The defence shall admit such material allegations in the statement of claim as the defendant knows to be true, or desires to be taken as established without proof thereof.

16.	Set-off or counterclaim to be pleaded

Where any defendant seeks to rely upon any fact as supporting a right of set-off or counterclaim, he shall, in his statement of defence, state specifically that he does so by way of set-off or counterclaim as the case may be, and the particulars of such set-off or counterclaim shall be given.

17.	Evidence on denial of allegation or in support of defence not set up in pleading

The defence of a defendant shall not debar him at the hearing from disproving any allegation of the plaintiff not admitted by the defence, or from giving evidence in support of a defence not expressly set up by the defence, except where the defence is such as, in the opinion of the Court, ought to have been expressly set up by the defence, or is inconsistent with the statements thereof, or is, in the opinion of the Court, likely to take the plaintiff by surprise or to raise new issues not fairly arising out of the pleadings, as they stand, and such as the plaintiff ought not to be then called upon to meet.

18.	Further pleadings

The Court, if it considers that the statement of claim and the defence filed in any suit insufficiently disclose and fix the real issues between the parties, may order such further pleadings to be filed as it may deem necessary for the purpose of bringing the parties to an issue.

19.	Costs in certain cases

Where the Court is of opinion that any allegations of fact, denied or not admitted by any pleading, ought to have been admitted, the Court shall make such order as may be just with respect to costs.

20.	Striking out pleadings

The Court may at any time, on the application of either party, strike out any pleading or any part thereof, on the ground that it discloses no cause of action, or no defence to the action, as the case may be, or on the ground that it is embarrassing, or scandalous or vexatious, or an abuse of the process of the Court; and the Court may either give leave to amend the pleading, or may proceed to give judgment for the plaintiff or the defendant, as the case may be, or may make such other order, and upon such terms and conditions, as may seem just.

21.	Denial of contract

When a contract, promise, or agreement is alleged in any pleading, a bare denial of the same by the opposite party shall be construed only as a denial in fact of the express contract, promise, or agreement alleged, or the matters of fact from which the same may be implied by law, and not as a denial of the legality or sufficiency in law of the contract, promise, or agreement, whether with reference to any statute or otherwise.

22.	Effect of documents to be stated

Wherever the contents of any document are material, it shall be sufficient in any pleading to state the effect thereof as briefly as possible, without setting out the whole or any part thereof, unless the precise words of the document or any part thereof are material.

23.	Malice, knowledge, on other condition of mind

Wherever it is material to allege malice, fraudulent intention, knowledge, or other condition of the mind of any person, it shall be sufficient to allege it as a fact without setting out the circumstances from which it is inferred.

24.	Notice

Wherever it is material to allege notice to any person of any fact, matter or thing, it shall be sufficient to allege the notice as a fact, unless the form or the precise terms of the notice or the circumstances from which the notice is to be inferred, is material.

25.	Implied contract or relation

(1)	Whenever any contract or any relation between any persons is to be implied from a series of let-ters or conversations, or otherwise from a number of circumstances, it shall be sufficient to allege the contract or relation as a fact, and to refer generally to those letters, conversations or circumstances without setting them out in detail.

(2)	If, as in sub-rule (1) of this Rule, the person so pleading desires to rely in the alternative upon more contracts or relations than one as to be implied from those circumstances, he may state them in the alternative.

26.	Presumptions of law

Neither party needs in any pleading allege any matter of fact which the law presumes in his favour or as to which the burden of proof lies upon the other side, unless the same has first been specifically denied (such as consideration for a bill of exchange where the plaintiff sues only on the bill, and not for the consideration as a substantive ground of claim).

27.	Technical objection

No technical objection shall be raised to any pleading on the ground of any alleged want of form.

28.	Stated or settled account

In every case in which the cause of action is a stated or settled account, the same shall be alleged with particulars but in any case in which a statement of account is relied on by way of evidence or ad-mission of any other cause of action which is pleaded, the same need not be alleged in the pleadings.

29.	Defence of tender

Where in any action a defence of tender before action is pleaded, the defendant shall pay into court in accordance with rule 1 of Order XXXI of these Rules the amount alleged to have been tendered, and the tender shall not be available as a defence unless and until payment into court has been made.

30.	Defence of set-off

Where a claim by a defendant to a sum of money (whether of an ascertained amount or not) is relied on as a defence to the whole or part of a claim made by the plaintiff, it may be included in the defence and set-off against the plaintiffs claim, whether or not it is also added as a counterclaim.

31.	Judgment for balance

(1)	Where in any action a set-off or counterclaim is established as a defence against the plaintiffs claim, the Court may, if the balance is in favour of the defendant, give judgment for the defendant for the balance, or otherwise adjudge to the defendant such relief as he may be entitled to upon the merits of the case.

(2)	Sub-rule (1) of this Rule shall apply mutatis mutandis where the balance is in favour of the plaintiff.

3.	Several defendants; one default

When in any action for a debt or liquidated demand there are several defendants, and one of them makes default as mentioned in rule 2 of this Order the plaintiff may have final judgment entered against the defendant so making default, and issue execution upon that judgment without prejudice to his right to proceed with his action against the other defendants.

4.	Default of defence: claim for unliquidated damages

Where the plaintiffs claim against a defendant is for unliquidated damages only, then, if that defen-dant makes default in pleading, the plaintiff may, after the expiration of the period fixed as aforesaid, for service of defence, have judgment entered against that defendant for damages to be assessed by the Court and costs, and may proceed with the action against the other defendants, if any.

5.	Default of defence: claim in detinue

Costs

A.	Security for costs

1.	Security for costs by plaintiff or defendant

(1) Where on the application of the plaintiff or defendant, as the case may be, to the Court it appears to the Court either at the commencement or at any stage of the proceedings—

(a)	that the plaintiff or defendant is ordinarily resident out of jurisdiction; or

(b)	that the plaintiff (not being a plaintiff who is suing in a representative capacity) is a nominal plaintiff who is suing for the benefit of some other person and that there is reason to believe that he will be unable to pay the costs of the defendant if ordered to do so; or

(c)	subject to sub-rule (2) of this Rule, that the plaintiffs address is not stated in the writ or other originating process or is incorrectly stated therein; or

(d)	that the plaintiff or the defendant has changed his address during the course of the proceed-ings with a view to evading the consequences of the litigation,

then if, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, the Court thinks it just to do so, it may order the plaintiff or the defendant to give such security for the plaintiffs costs or defendant’s costs of the action or other proceedings as it thinks just.

(2)	The Court shall not require a plaintiff to give security by reason only of sub-rule (1) (c) of this Rule if he satisfies the Court that the failure to state his address or the mis-statement thereof was made innocently and without intention to deceive.

(3)	The references in the foregoing rule to a plaintiff and a defendant shall be construed as references to the person (howsoever described on the record) who is in the position of plaintiff or defendant, as the case may be, in the proceeding in question, including a proceeding on a counterclaim.

7.	Principles to be observed in fixing costs

In fixing the amount of costs, the principle to be observed is that the party who is in the right is to be indemnified for the expenses to which he has been necessarily put in establishing his claim, defence or counterclaim, but the Court may take into account all the circumstances of the case.

8.	Stay of proceedings till costs paid

Where the Court orders costs to be paid or security to be given for costs by any party, the Court may, if it thinks fit, order all proceedings by or on behalf of that party in the same suit or proceedings, or connected therewith, to be stayed until the costs are paid or security given accordingly, but the order shall not supersede the use of any other lawful method of enforcing payment.

9.	Taxation of costs

When the Court deems it to be impracticable to determine summarily the amount of any costs which it has adjudged or ordered to be paid, all questions relating thereto may either be determined upon taxation by the Court itself or may be referred by the Court to a taxing master and be ascertained by him and approved by the Court.

LEGAL NOTICE ON PUBLICATION OF THE 2006 CENSUS REPORT

[S.I. No. 5 of2007.]

Whereas the National Population Commission conducted national population and housing census between 21 and 27 March, 2006, followed by a post enumeration survey in June 2006;

And whereas the National Population Commission has as required by the Constitution of Nigeria, 1999, delivered to me the report of the said population and housing Census, 2006;

And whereas the Council of State has advised me to accept the said report;

And whereas the report of the population and housing census has been laid on the table of each House of the National Assembly;

Now therefore in exercise of the power conferred upon me by virtue of section 213 (4) of the Con-stitution of Nigeria, 1999 and all other powers enabling me in that behalf, I, Olusegun Obasanjo, President, Federal Republic of Nigeria do hereby publish for information Report On Census, 2006 Provisional Results as appearing in the, Schedule to this Legal Notice.

SCHEDULE

DETAILED REPORT ON THE CENSUS, 2006 AND PROVISIONAL RESULTS

The 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria mandates the National Population Com-mission (NPC) to carry out a population census in the country and provide accurate and reliable census results. The primary objective of the census results is to assist the country in knowing as accurately and reliably as is possible within the constraints the population size, its composition and distribution. The population figures and characteristics arising out of census help the country to meet its developmental, administrative and political needs and provide inputs while planning for improving the quality of life of our countrymen. Accordingly the population and housing Census, 2006, was carried out during 21 to 27 March, 2006, followed with the post enumeration survey (PES) in June, 2006.

All the UN member nations are expected to carry out a reliable and accurate population and housing census, preferably every ten years. It is also expected that while carrying out the census exercise scientific and modem concepts are used and international standards met. The previous census was carried out in November, 1991 and therefor the Census, 2006 was conducted after a gap of fifteen years for various reasons and not ten years as mandated. Since in developing countries there is much population dynamics involved, if censuses are not carried out with regularity, vital data gap occurs not allowing the country to plan properly for its people based on sound demographic data. With carrying out the Census, 2006, this vital gap now seems to have been covered and catered for.

The Nigerian census history is replete with controversies over the population count and the earlier efforts to provide the country with accurate and reliable figures ended up most of the time in controversies leading to the cancellation of the exercise or non-acceptability of the census results, with the exception of the 1991 Census. This was mostly due to over politicisation of the census process, failure to meet the international standards and lack of transparency in the methodology and processes adopted. Varying degrees of over-enumeration of population was rampant through out the country coupled with omission of certain settlements in the earlier census exercises and this possibly contributed much to the unacceptability of the census results. To overcome these deficiencies the present Commission adopted the use of the modem and internationally accepted standards and concepts of census taking with total transparency being practised to allow both for national and international monitoring of the processes and methodologies used in Census, 2006. As per the UN guidelines it takes about thirty-six months advance preparation for any country to conduct the population and housing census. This is because it is commonly understood that census is the biggest peacetime activity in any country for mobilising men and material for a single and simultaneous operation through out the country. The preparations for this census truly began in the later half of 2004 with the international development partners, EU, UNFPA, UNDP, DFID and USAID agreeing to support the census activity of the Federal Government by providing financial and technical assistance. NPC acknowledges the total support of the Federal Government and the Developmental Partners which assisted it in conducting this census exercise. The Commission also acknowledges the support provided in this exercise at various stages by the National Assembly, state and local governments, CSGS, Faith Based Organisations, NGOs, traditional rulers and several other stakeholders. The media, both print and electronic, national and regional, need to be commended for their commitment to reach the census messages to the people of Nigeria in every nook and comer of the country however remote.

An accurate and reliable census usually implies that the coverage and content of the census are fairly satisfactory. While no census exercise any where in the world is perfect in terms of coverage or content, the critical question is the quality of the efforts and methodology used. To ensure that the entire country is covered during the census operations, the Commission embarked de novo on carrying out the enumeration area demarcation exercise to cover all settlements however small and remote and carve out enumeration areas for proper assignment of the work load to enumerators. Satellite imageries were also used where permissible. To ensure full involvement of the people, a massive public awareness campaign was launched throughout the country with special attention to rural and remote populations. This effort led to full support and participation of the people during the enumeration and it is estimated that the coverage was more than satisfactory. To estimate the coverage error, the PES was conducted as per international practice, in June, 2006 and the results from the PES when available are expected to be used for validating this assertion on area coverage.

Following the census field work, the data processing of the census data collected by the enumerators on the census form began in seven Data Processing Centres (DPCs) where the census forms collected from the field were duly archived. Modem and reliable processes of scanning and editing the census forms were used with additional safety margins built in during census form printing and designing of introducing state code on every form. This helped in ensuring that census forms of one state did not and could not be used during the field exercise or mixed up during data processing with another state. In addition any forms tom apart or that could not be scanned for any reason were examined by a special group and manually data entered. Thus total and complete integrity was attempted and maintained of the data during its processing. The transmission of the data from the Data Processing Centres to the headquarters was kept fully secured with the use of passwords.

Next stage in data processing is data extraction, concatenation, validation and moderation of the data if it does not meet the demographic patterns. Extreme care was observed during these processes and this activity was restricted to a select expert and technically competent group with close monitoring by International experts. Due cognisance was undertaken of the past history of the previous census validation efforts and critical observations made by the EU monitoring group in their report following the census. To quote from the EU monitoring report, Chapter 5 Recommendations ‘Recommendation 1: Clean the data carefully’. Again to quote from the Executive Summary of the same report, 'Conclusion 2: The accuracy of the raw data coming from the field is partly unsatisfactory and the data needs careful cleaning at the DPCs.” Cleaning and improving of data does not imply manipulating it. It means using conventional and non-conventional (country specific) demographic and statistical techniques for examining the data quality and evolving and adopting suitable methodology for this purpose. If on examination, it is observed that the quality of the data collected is not up to the mark and it is not improved upon and presented as such, the adulterated data will result in garbage in and garbage out, making a mockery of the census results technically and demographically. This obviously will lead to the unacceptability of the census results both nationally and internationally leading to a serious waste of national resources international aid while making a serious dent of the reputation and pride of the country in international and diplomatic spheres for its inability to know ‘HOW MANY ARE WE’? The methodology used therefor also factored in such instances where no or partial enumeration was reported during the census. Efforts will be made to carry out detailed and intense verification in the coming months to fully determine and adjudicate technically all such and similar cases and use of the PES will also be made to fine tune the results particularly at the lowest administrative level such as LGA and locality; This is another good reason that the current report covers the national and state population figures only.

While every effort possible has been made to ensure the integrity and credibility of the census results, it is humanly impossible to meet the expectations of all the people in the country. This is particularly so, if there is already a mind set or a pre-conceived notion of a particular population figure in somebody’s perception. During my advocacy visits to several states I had observed and noted that even several months prior to the conduct of the census important, responsible and highly placed individuals, organisations and even academicians had determined to the decimal point the population of a particular area or region. There is a feeling in some quarters that their cities or states have already reached a particular population level while others feel that they cannot loose their past demographic advantage or growth rates. Population dynamics cannot and do not remain stationary or constant over long intervals and in developing countries need to be underscored here.

Almost all these wild guesstimates apparently were based on their perception mostly out of ignorance or possibly ulterior motives to suit their agenda. Most of these assertions fail to pass the known demographic patterns and therefor need to be dealt with appropriately and immediately at the highest level if these surface again following the declaration of the census results, particularly if these statements are inflammatory and detrimental to the unity of the country and its people, ITiere it would be advisable to brief the political, social and religious leaders and individuals who command respect in the society and in exalted positions to exercise caution and discretion while commenting on census results and help in assuaging the feelings of the people. Media management therefor will be a top priority activity to attend to unreasonable and unscientific criticism of the census results. It is also proposed to convene a meeting of the Development Partners as soon as possible and if Mr President accepts the census results. This will help in making the census results acceptable internationally also.

The next phase will involve the processing, collation, validation and tabulation of the final popula-tion totals and characteristics. This will include most importantly for the first time the data on housing stock, amenities and assets available to the household. Results on fertility and mortality as also age, literacy, educational levels, migration, marital status, occupation, etc., will also be processed. The demographic, social and economic characteristics of the population will be used for better allocation of resources, as intervention instruments and for improving the overall quality of life of our countrymen. All this work along with a very powerful campaign for disseminating the data at several levels from the national to the local level has been planned for in the coming years.

MAIN FINDINGS OF CENSUS, 2006 PROVISIONAL RESULTS

1.	The total provisional population of Nigeria is 140,003,542 comprising of 71,709,859 males and 68,293,683 females (Annexure A). This translates in an annual growth rate of 3.2 per cent over the 1991 Census figures (Annexure B). It may be remembered that the provisional population totals for Census, 2006 do not take into consideration any territorial regions, which have been ceded to another country since the census taking. Also the state totals at this point of time do not take into account any inter state or international boundary disputed areas. These areas will be dealt with appropriately while finalising the census results.

2.	The sex ratio of the population is 105 and shows slight preponderance of males over females at the national level.

3.	The state population totals indicate an annual growth rate between 2.8 to 3.5 per cent (except Abuja FCT) with most of the state growth rates hovering between 2.9 to 3.3 per cent (Annexure B).

4.	The population size of the states indicates that their relative position has by and large remained stable with the first six states retaining their position as it is while most of the other states observe minor shifts (Annexures A and C).

5.	Abuja FCT area has grown at a phenomenal annual growth rate of 9.3 per cent (Annexure B). This is almost three times the national growth rate in spite of the fact that much demolition and therefor possibly forced population out migration took place just before the census. It may also be remembered that Abuja FCT population does not include the satellite towns in neighbouring states of Niger and Nasarawa.

6.	As regards regional population distribution the states comprising northern Nigeria constitute about 53.6 per cent while the states in southern Nigeria constitute about 46.4 per cent of the country’s population.

7.	The national and state provisional population totals appear to be accurate, credible and demog- raphically and technically plausible. These figures are in broad agreement with the scientifically worked out population projections and other demographic data available and therefor in my view should be accepted.

LEGAL NOTICE ON PUBLICATION OF THE DETAILS

OF THE BREAKDOWN OF THE NATIONAL AND

STATE PROVISIONAL TOTALS, 2006 CENSUS

[S.I. No. 23 of 2007.]

Whereas:

The National Population Commission conducted national population and housing census between 21 and 27 March, 2006, followed by a post enumeration survey in June, 2006;

The National Population Commission has as required by the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999, delivered to me the report of the said Population and Housing Census, 2006;

I have accepted the report on the advice of the Council of State;

The report has been laid on the table of each House of the National Assembly;

The detailed report on the Census, 2006 and provisional results was published in Federal Govern-ment’s Extraordinary Gazette, No. 4 of 19 January, 2007, Vol. 94 as Statutory Instrument No. 5;

And the National Population Commission has presented to me Details of the breakdown of the Na-tional and State Provisional Population Totals 2006 Census with the Explanatory Note;

Now therefore, in exercise of the powers conferred upon me by virtue of section 213 (4) of the Con-stitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999, and all other powers enabling me in that behalf, I, Olusegun Obasanjo, President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, do hereby publish for information Details of the Breakdown of the National and State Provisional Population Totals 2006 Census as ap-pearing in Second Schedule to this Legal Notice.

FIRST SCHEDULE

General Explanatory Note For The Breakdown of State Population Totals For 2006

Census Provisional Results

The national and state population totals were accepted by the Federal Government on 9 January, 2007. The stage is now set for providing the breakdown of the state population totals by LGA. While appreciating the 774 LGAs provisional population totals, the following important issues must be borne in mind before reaching any hasty conclusions or expressing opinions as these may not take into account various known and unknown facts and situations which may seem not to influence population dynamics.

1.	While it is possible to explain largely (though not necessarily fully) through demographic principles the changes in population size and its distribution at the country and state level this may not necessarily hold true 

at the LGA level. This is because of the huge differences in the physical areas and the population size at the LGA level. While the impact of migration of the population is likely to have a relatively small impact at the national and state level, this could be a significant factor at the LGA level in several instances. It may be recalled also that the 1991 and 2006 censuses were carried out in different months and seasons and the mobility of the population in terms of direction and quantum is unevenly distributed over the year. Thus broadly speaking LGA populations could be influenced favourably or adversely by population movements - seasonal or due to several other factors.

2.	It may again be recalled that new States and LG As were created just before the 1991 Census and also in 1996. This resulted in the increase of LGAs from 555 to 593 and then finally to 774. The apportionment of the Enumeration Areas (EAs) to reflect the newly created LGAs population may not have been perfect in all cases as the demarcation of the new boundaries of the LGAs affected was not necessarily clear in all cases when the results were finalised for 1991 Census. The Commission was dependent on other agencies while assigning EAs of 1991 Census to the newly created LGAs and changes continued to take place thereafter. The frequent boundary changes before and after the 1991 Census thus could have affected the process of population apportionment due to this and other factors.

3.	The 1991 population figures for 774 LGAs were on a stand alone basis and no comparison, validation or consistency checks against previous population totals was required or carried out as none existed. Thus if wittingly or unwittingly any errors were introduced, these cannot be rectified now with retrospective effect and will continue to affect the totals if comparisons are made or consistency checks are applied.

4.	There is a gap of over fourteen years between the 1991 and 2006 Census during which seven new States and 219 new LGAs were created. While the old names of the LGAs continue in most cases, these LGAs (bifurcated or trifurcated) now do not reflect the same area as their previous self and therefor their population size has undergone a significant change. The creation of new States and LGAs would possibly have influenced population dynamics of in and out migration, The precise nature, direction and quantum of changes in population movement is unlikely to be evenly distributed and will necessarily be consistent or in accordance with public or political perceptions. While some LGAs may even lose populations others may increase at a phenomenal pace due to various factors which may not necessarily be explained fully by known demographic principles. The reasons for churning of the population could be influenced by political, administrative, social, ethnic, religious, industrial and even international events.

5.	It may again be recalled that certain areas of the country during the 1991 Census complained/experienced an undercount of population (over count is not well recorded but it is likely to have occurred in some LGAs). If during the 2006 Census these areas (of undercount in 1991) were better covered, these are likely to experience a higher growth. Similarly areas where over count could not be repeated this time and was better controlled during 2006 Census, may experience a very low increase in population.

6.	The population size and the physical area of the .774 LGAs varies considerably in the country. Gen-erally speaking certain highly urban LGAs had a very small land area and their physical capacity to take population increase was already exhausted or extremely limited. This was particularly true if the LGAs in question had commercial/administrative/industrial features and if the land/building prices were very high. There were as many as 76 LGAs (about 10%), which had a physical area of less than 20 x 10 kms i.e. 200 kms. It may also be remembered that as per 1991 Census, there were as many as 64 LGAs (about 9%), which had a population of less than 50,000 while 21 LGAs had a population of over 300,000. While a relatively small population increase will make a huge visible impression of population growth for such small sized LGAs, to have similar impact for big size LGAs a very large population increase is required. The LGAs with small population size were Bakassi LGA in Cross River state and Eastern Obolo LGA in Akwa Ibom state.

7.	The country has witnessed during the period of the two censuses several social disturbances due to political, ethnic and religious reasons in certain areas. This has possibly resulted in population move-ments of precisely unknown quantum and direction within or even outside the LGAs and states. These movements could be short term or long term and therefor accordingly be reflected in the population of the affected LGAs. Similarly, if the ground situation improved after the 1991 Census, certain populations which had moved out of the LGAs before the 1991 Census and were enumerated in a particular LGA then would not have been enumerated in 2006 in the same LGA as before. Thus while some LGAs will now gain others will definitely suffer loss due to such population movements. It may be  

recalled that some enumerating staff deployed by the Commission for 2006 Census were killed while some were assaulted and chased away during the current census in certain parts of the country. These areas are likely to be affected.

8.	There are reportedly population movements into certain LGAs on or near the international borders due to the arising diplomatic situation with certain neighbouring countries.

9.	It is not known how the disputed areas were settled while finalising the 1991 Census results. There are no explanatory notes to this effect in official publications. The Commission is aware that disputed areas within and among states exist. Proper identification of the localities and EAs is currently under progress and when finalised will be taken into account for the final population at LGA level. For the moment barring Taraba state no such effect has been given.

10.	Possible use of the Post Enumeration Survey (PES) result on validation of the final census results is awaited. This will depend on when the PES result is available and its quality.

11.	One should always remember that the DETAILS OF THE BREAKDOWN OF THE NATIONAL AND STATE PROVISIONAL POPULATION TOTALS, 2006 CENSUS are provisional and not the final results. If there is any clerical or other bona fide error, it will be taken into account and rectified when the consistency and validation checks are performed before the final results are prepared and presented in due course.

CORRIGENDUM

12.	In case of Osun state, the population figure for the state in the last row should read as 3,423,535 instead of 3,423,536 and the female figure should read as 1,682,916 instead of 1,682,917 published in Federal Government's Extraordinary Gazette, No. 4 of 19th January, 2007, Vol. 94 as Statutory Instrument, No. 5.

REPORT ON THE CENSUS, 2006, FINAL RESULTS

It is with great pleasure that I submit for Your Excellency’s consideration and approval, the report on the Census, 2006, final results. In the extraordinary meeting of the National Population Commission held today, 24th September, 2008, the Commission deliberated on the final population totals for the country, every state and Local Government Area and approved the results at its level, which are submitted herewith. This report is in pursuance of the two earlier reports submitted vide my letters reference nos. NPC/10/S-48/XVLIII/23 8 dated 29 December, 2006 and NPC/10/S-48/XIV/29 dated 11 April, 2007, respectively.

The total population (both sexes) of Nigeria is 140,431,790 (one hundred forty million, four hundred thirty one thousand, seven hundred ninety) comprising of 71,345,488 (seventy one million, three hundred forty-five thousand, four hundred and eighty eight) males and 69,086,302 (sixty nine million, eighty-six thousand, three hundred and two) females. The absolute change in the population of the country is 428,248 (four hundred twenty eight thousand, two hundred and forty-eight) and the percentage change is an increase of 0.3 per cent (point three per cent) over the provisional results. There has been no change in the relative ranking of any of the states from the approved provisional population results.

ANNEXUREA

REPORT ON THE 2006 CENSUS FINAL RESULTS

1.	This report records the salient features of the many efforts made and several steps undertaken by the National Population Commission which led to the conceptualisation, government approval, in-ternational support and actual conduct of the Population and Housing Census, 2006, in a democratic set up after a long interval. The report should be read in conjunction with the earlier explanatory notes, which form a part of the earlier census reports to the President by the Commission and were gazetted in January, 2007 and May, 2007 respectively (Extraordinary Federal Republic of Nigeria Official Gazette, No. 4, Lagos 19th January, 2007, Vol. 94 and Extraordinary Federal Republic of Nigeria Official Gazette, No. 24, Lagos 15 May, 2007, Vol. 94).

2.	It is expected that this report should facilitate considerably all census stakeholders in the country and outside, to appreciate the enormous complexities and risks involved in undertaking a population census, considered usually as the single biggest peace time activity operations in moving men and material in any country, but more so in Nigeria where it no longer remains a purely administrative and statistical exercise. The political undertones and ethno-religious bonds still form, influence and attempt to distort considerably the process of population enumeration. This report will also provide a glimpse of the special ‘Nigerian factors’ which have affected the past censuses and some of which continue to haunt this one as well. Arguably therefor conducting a population census and making some sense out of the processed data in our country is not a straight forward job as described in the standard text books or experienced in most countries the world over. The perils are far too many at every step but every conceivable effort has been made by the Commission to keep the census on track and to overcome these within the constraints of the prevailing working environment, the social and political milieu of the country and provide with as credible a census, with minimum errors, as is humanly possible, challenges undermining it notwithstanding.

3.	It requires political courage and conviction by the government of the day in our country to an-nounce its intention of conducting a census, supporting it and their accepting its results. The exer-cise is full of land mines and has the potential of destabilising the government and the country, if enough care is not taken to make it worthy of acceptance nationally and internationally. One wrong step during the preparations or conduct of the census or when the results are announced could explode in the face and heads in the government or of the government could roll on the ground in a split second. These risks and sensitivity need to be very much appreciated in the Nigerian context in comparison to how censuses are conducted and the results accepted without a whimper in other countries. The challenge is to control politicisation and manipulation of the census exercise at all costs and at every step by the agency responsible for conducting it. While it may look to the naive that an exercise such as holding of elections has a greater political risk, the fact that population figures arising from census are the core basis of revenue allocation and electoral representations, the subtle Nigerian mind understands that once the census results are accepted nothing can be undone until the next census, which could be several years apart (the last census was fifteen years earlier, (2006 - 1991), and the preceding one twenty-eight years earlier (1991- 1963)). In a democratic set up, elections will be held every, four years but the uncertainty of the next census looms large irrespective whether there is a civilian or a military dispensation.

Historical Background of Censuses in Independent Nigeria

4.	The history of census taking in independent Nigeria has been riddled with controversies. Censuses in pre-independence colonial Nigeria were neither conducted synchronously nor as per the modem principles of population enumeration. The first census in independent Nigeria was conducted in 1962, but had to be cancelled after declaration of the results, as it did not meet the ‘expectations’ of the political elite. Another census was conducted in 1963, which was ultimately accepted politically with much rancour but technically the results were not defensible as these have been often termed as ‘negotiated’. However, in absence of any other reliable population figures for several years, the results of the 1963 census formed the basis of planning and political governance. Another census was attempted in 1973 by the then military regime but after conducting the census, the results were declared annulled by the then government.

5.	No census could be conducted in the 1980’s and in 1991 the then military government conducted a census. The provisional results were declared in 1992 but the final results could be accepted by the government only in October, 1997. Although not everyone either in the country or outside accepted the census results of 1991, over the years by and large there was general consensus that the 1991 results were a fair representation of the national and regional populations. With the installation of a democratic government in 1999, attempts were made to hold a census at the beginning of the new century but these efforts could not materialise. With the return of the same democratically elected government in 2003, more efforts at the governmental level were made to conduct a census now, which finally culminated in holding it in March, 2006. Thus it is clear that our country has a long way to go and establish a tradition of conducting periodical censuses every ten years and allow it to be an administrative and technical exercise devoid of politics of numbers, region or ethnicity. The overall acceptability of the census therefor should be viewed by all stakeholders in light of these historical facts with a view to strengthen the process of conducting census regularly and at definite intervals.

Constitutional Responsibility for Conducting and Procedure for Accepting Census Results

6.	Let us understand and appreciate the current process and steps involved in conducting and accep-tance of the census results as laid down in the Constitution and the potential risks involved. The 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria mandates the National Population Commission with the responsibility of conducting the population census in the country. The Chairman of the Commission and thirty-seven Federal Commissioners each representing a State and the FCT are appointed by the President (subject to the confirmation of the Senate) and form the body of the Commission. In addition, as regards the appointment of the Chairman of the Commission, the President is mandated to consult the Council of State. Thus each state is equally represented and their interests are duly taken care of, so as to avoid charges of manipulation of census results against any state or by any state. It is because of this arrangement of having a Federal Commis-sioner representing the interest of every state in the union that it is inconceivable and practically impossible to allow manipulation of the census results in favour of or against any state. The Direc-tor-General of the Commission, who is the accounting officer and the technical head of the man-agement, is an ex-officio member of the Commission. Under Section 158 (2) of the Constitution, the Commission is not subjected to any direction or control of any authority or person in carrying out the operation of conducting the census or in compiling its report of the national census. Thus while much autonomy has been granted in law to the Commission in conducting its affairs with regard to the census, administering it in reality is a very challenging, painstaking and conscientious task.

7.	The census results are first examined by the Commission and after due deliberations may be ac-cepted by it. Under section 213, the Chairman of the Commission presents and delivers the report of the population census to the President. The President, if he is satisfied with the census results, within thirty days shall lay the report before the Council of State, which shall consider it and advice him whether to accept or reject it. Further, when the Council of State advises the President to accept the report, the President is mandated to accept the report and also lay it on the table of each House of the National Assembly. In a scenario where the President has accepted the report and has also laid it on the table of both the chambers of the National Assembly, the report shall be published in the Official Gazette for public information. If, however, the Council of State advises the 

President to reject the report on the grounds that the population results are inaccurate or the report is perverse, the report shall be so rejected by the President and no reliance shall be placed upon any such report by any authority or person for any purpose whatsoever. The consequence of the rejection of the census report is draconian and under section 157 (3), ‘All members of the National Population Commission shall cease to be members if the President declares a National Census Report as unreliable and the report is rejected in accordance with section 213 of this Constitution.’

Stages in Conducting Population and Homing Census

8.	The constitution of Nigeria mandates the National Population Commission (NPOPC) to carry out a population census in the country and provide an accurate and reliable census result. The primary objective of the census results is to assist the country in knowing as accurately and reliably as is possible within the constraints the population size, its composition and distribution. The population figures and characteristics arising out of census help the country to meet its developmental, administrative and political needs and provide inputs while planning for improving the quality of life of our countrymen. Accordingly the population and housing Census, 2006 was carried out during 21 to 25 March, 2006 and extended by two days to facilitate enumeration of population on a de-facto basis. It was followed by the Post Enumeration Survey (PES) in June, 2006.

9.	All the UN member nations are expected to carry out a reliable and accurate population and housing census preferably every ten years. It is also expected that while carrying out the census exercise scientific and modem concepts are used and international standards met. The previous census was carried out in November, 1991 and therefor the Census, 2006 was conducted after a gap of about fifteen years for various reasons and not ten years as is the norm. Since in developing countries there is much population dynamics involved, if censuses are not carried out with regularity, a vital data gap occurs not allowing the country to plan properly for its people based on sound demographic data. With carrying out the Census, 2006, this vital gap now seems to have been cov-ered and catered for.

10.	The Nigerian census history is replete with controversies over the population count and the earlier efforts to provide the country with accurate and reliable figures ended up most of the time in con-troversies leading to the cancellation of the exercise or non-acceptability of the census results, with the exception of the 1991 Census. This was mostly due to over-politicisation of the census process, failure to meet the international standards and lack of transparency in the methodology and processes adopted. Varying degrees of over-enumeration of population was rampant through out the country coupled with omission of certain settlements in the earlier census exercise and this coupled with the failure to technically control it, possibly contributed much to the unacceptability of the census results. To improve on these and other deficiencies the present Commission adopted the use of the internationally accepted standards and concepts of census taking with total transparency being practiced to allow both for national and international monitoring of the processes and methodologies used in Census, 2006.

11.	As per the UN guidelines, it takes about thirty-six months advance preparation for any country to conduct the population and housing census of the country. This is because it is commonly under-stood that census is the biggest peacetime activity in any country for mobilising men and material for a single and simultaneous operation through out the country. It was decided to initially hold the census in 2001, but Nigeria had to miss the 2000 round of global census for various reasons. With the same democratic government returning to power in 2003, it was decided to hold the census in November-December, 2005. The preparations for this census truly began in the later half of 2004 with the international development partners (EU, UNFPA, UNDP, DFID and USAID) agreeing to support the census activity of the Federal Government by providing financial and technical assistance.

12.	The basis for conducting a census rests on creating a sound census frame to ensure as complete coverage as is possible of all settlements in the country. This process is the stepping stone in initi-ating the census field work and it is usually expected that certain continuity will be maintained from the previous census and should be consistent with the local administrative structure. Listing of all localities and creation of appropriate Enumeration Areas (EAs) so as to permit the pair of enumerators (an enumeration team consisted usually of two enumerators, one male and the other female) to complete enumeration of the area(s) assigned to them forms the basis of the Enumeration Area Demarcation (EAD) exercise. A completely de-novo delineation of EAs began for the 2006 Census without any linkage or continuity with the 1991 Census in three phases. In the first phase, commencing in mid 2004, seven LGAs were selected for this exercise, one local government area in each of the six geo-political zones and FCT Abuja. In the second phase of EAD exercise, beginning in November, 2004, thirty-seven LGAs, one from each state and FCT Abuja were selected. And finally in early 2005, the EAD exercise was launched throughout the country in all the states. It was expected that this phase will be completed by June, 2006, leaving enough time for establishing the complete census frame, before the scheduled enumeration in November- December, 2005. Satellite imageries were also procured with assistance of DFID, UK to assist in EAD exercise,

13.	The third phase of EAD exercise which began in earnest, however, ran into problems of timely financial support. The Commission had to fall back on the support of the state governments and in some cases even local governments assisted the EAD exercise financially and in kind. Eventually this slowed down the pace of the delineation considerably and monitoring and supervision also suffered and influenced the large number of undersized EAs ultimately created than what was ex-pected. This was abetted also by an unfortunate perception in the field that greater the number of EAs, however unequal their size may be, greater will be the population enumerated ultimately. This situation ultimately led to a large number of EAs delineated and also led to deviation from the standard size EAs in many cases throughout the country. However the situation was appropriately controlled before the enumeration took place so that the workload of the enumerator remained equitable as far as possible taking into account certain factors.

14.	In 2003, the Commission constituted a Census Technical Working Group (CTWG), under the Di-rector-General of the Commission and comprising of all the technical Directors from the divisions (Director Census, Director Cartography, Director Planning and Research, Director Information Technology, Director Vital Registration and Director Public Affairs), and senior and experienced census and survey technical staff from all divisions and even from the state offices. The mandate to the CTWG was to discuss all the census procedures and processes as per the international guidelines, customising them to the Nigerian environment, and examine all the technical issues re-lated to every stage of the census from conceptualising to its full execution and implementation. The objective was to provide the country with a transparent, credible and accurate census as was possible. This was the highest technical body to advise the Commission on all technical aspects and phases of census. The principle of continuing with the de facto methodology of enumeration as adopted in 1991 Census was recommended and finally accepted by the Commission. The total of all usual residents is generally referred as the de facto population and the total of all persons present and enumerated as the de facto population. This principle of enumerating persons present, seen and making themselves available for enumeration when the enumerator visited their households formed the core basis for conducting the census.

15.	As the principal instrument for conducting census it was felt necessary by the Commission to hold a national consultation on the methodology of conducting the census and inclusion of population and housing variables in this national endeavour. Accordingly a national workshop was held in September, 2004, in Kaduna where the principal stakeholders from across the country including Federal Ministries, National Bureau of Statistics, State governments, CSGs, FBOs, Pressure Groups, Academicians, Demographers, Social Scientists and Development Partners were invited.

At the end of the workshop the census methodology and a draft set of census questionnaire was adopted. The contentious, sensitive and political issue of inclusion of the questions on religion and, ethnicity was left for the Federal Government to decide. Taking into account the overall situation and past history of the (mis)interpretations of the population composition by ethnicity and religious group and its potential to divide the country and prevent from conducting or accepting the census results, it was decided that for the 2006 census these two variables should not be included.

Raising Public Awareness and Public Participation

16.	To involve all segments of the Nigerian population in conducting the census, the Chairman and all the Federal Commissioners undertook extensive and exhaustive advocacy tours to each of the thirty*-six states and FCT and Local Government Councils there in. They met the Executive Gov-ernors or their representatives, Chairmen of Local Governments, Traditional Rulers, Faith Based Organisations (FBOs), Civil Society Groups (CSGs) and NGOs in addition to the members of the public and local media. To muster the support of the mobile nomadic population for their proper enumeration, the Commission made extra efforts in not only seeking the involvement and partner-ship of the National Nomadic Education Commission, Kaduna, but also of the state based other nomadic organisations and community leaders all over the country. To improve rural awareness, special market rallies on census themes were organised by the Commission across the country in addition to approaching the people through the network of national and regional radio, television and newspaper in local languages. Special sensitisation workshops on ‘Census Awareness’ for the media houses were organised by the Commission with the assistance of UNFPA on more than one occasion in various parts of the country. Six regional workshops in each of the six geo-political zones were organised before the census to involve the various CSGs/NGOs and FBOs in monitoring of the census. These organisations were also provided with accredited identity cards from the Commission to visit any part of the country to monitor the census training and enumeration process. These advocacy measures were taken in addition to the usual campaign strategies on electronic and print media of the television, radio and newspaper in all regional/local languages. The principle of de facto census, that is only those present will be enumerated, was emphasised time and again in these campaigns.

National and International Monitoring

17.	It is important to note that the EU constituted a five member independent ‘Monitoring Mission’ since December, 2004, to report to it and other Development Partners regularly, on the various aspects of the preparations undertaken by the Commission and whether international standards as laid down by the UN were being followed scrupulously or not. Any short comings noticed by the census experts of the Monitoring Team were brought to the attention of the Commission and were promptly attended to and rectified. To improve transparency, most of the information on various census aspects was hosted on the Commission’s website for public display and scrutiny and comments if any. As a part of monitoring of EU assisted projects in the country, special monitors were sent by EU to report to it on the census project also every year since 2005 and another mission is underway as this report is being finalised.

18.	As an important element of bringing transparency and credibility and with a view to have an unbi-ased monitoring, for the training and enumeration process, eighty-eight international monitors (census experts), were recruited by the EU from twenty-three countries. The country wide moni-toring began on 3 March and ended on 12 May, 2006. It covered census training for census enu-merators and supervisors, conduct of the population enumeration, retrieval of the census forms from the field and payment of the allowances to the census field functionaries. The monitoring efforts were facilitated by the Commission for these eighty-eight International Experts, in addition to the national monitors.

19.	The EU Monitoring Mission’s report on conduct of the 2006 Census was submitted to EU in May, 2006. This report adjudicated the census processes as transparent and credible and meeting the in-ternational standards with some advisory on cleaning up the data collected during the census. To quote from the EU REPORT, ‘The Monitors observed that the people were trained and worked as enumerators have shown great dedication to their jobs. Also the general public has generally been very positive towards the Census and has provided hospitality to the enumerators who often had to work in difficult circumstances and ‘Overall the EU monitors consider that the Nigerian people, and all organisations who made positive contributions to the preparation and execution of this phase of the Census, can congratulate themselves on 'a job well done”.’

20.	The Commission knowing the past history of the allegations of politicisation of the census process and manipulation of results, adopted an open door and transparent policy of sharing all possible information at every stage of the census preparations, enumeration and data processing. The EU monitoring team had access to all departmental heads in the Commission. In addition the Com-mission held regular and open meetings from time-to-time with the Development Partners and up-dated them on the current status of census activities. A special visit of the media houses was or-ganised by the Commission in the month of August, 2006 for the media to understand the huge work of data processing and the complexities involved. This helped them to appreciate better the arrangements and procedure for data processing deployed by the Commission at the seven regional Data Processing Centres (DPCs) including the security measures undertaken. In addition five EU consultants were posted at the DPCs to ensure that the neutrality aspects and quality assurance standards required are being observed while data processing was in progress and until its completion. There were two open and televised live sessions across the country, ‘Presidential Stakeholders Forum on 2006 Census on 15 March, 2006, one week prior to the Census and again on 5 October, 2006, when the data processing was underway. Stakeholders from all walks of life, including the Development Partners, attended this forum where the Chairman made presentations on the current state of Census. The question and answer session lasted for over two hours on each of these two occasions and every sundry query on census preparations or data processing were re-sponded to on the spot, leaving no lingering doubt in any body’s mind. This was transparency, of the entire census process, demonstrated at its best twice in full public view and publicly scrutinised, adding much creditworthiness to the census process and it is very much doubted if this can be repealed or rivalled by any organisation in the country or outside.

International Support

21.	International assistance for census came in the form of advocacy, technical back stopping, and financial aid. UNFPA helped the Commission in getting commitment from all the Development Partners in the country to assist in conducting the census. The principal agencies which assisted in conduct of the census financially, technically or administratively are the EU, UNDP, UNFPA, DFID and USAID. About forty-eight per cent of the cost of the census was borne by the Development Partners, most of it by EU alone. UNDP gave total support in disbursement of the allowances to census functionaries, DFID provided satellite imageries and other technical support while UNFPA assisted in providing technical back stopping and in advocacy measures.

22.	It may not be out of place to mention that not a single Kobo of the international financial aid for census taking came into the coffers of the Commission. The payment of allowances to the census functionaries, which accounted for approximately seventy per cent of the total EU budget, was handled directly by the UNDP who did an admirable job. The payments for printing and supply of census forms and for the hardware and software for data processing were handled directly by the EU with the participation and approval of the National Planning Commission. 

23.	The Commission was assisted in technical matters both by the UNFPA and the EU. An interim Chief Technical Adviser (CTA) on census was engaged by UNFPA who provided services mostly in the second half of 2004 until March, 2005. He undertook three missions and assisted the Commission on various aspects of census preparations and technicalities. Another very experienced census expert was appointed by UNFPA and a short mission was undertaken by him in November, 2004. He assessed the existing status of the census preparations and advised the Commission to undertake specific steps. Finally UNFPA provided the services of an International Consultant on Census, as a full time CTA from end of May, 2005, to provide necessary technical backstopping to the Commission on various aspects of census, Two IT experts on setting up the Data Processing Centres and help in various aspects of data processing were recruited by EU as full time IT and Data Processing Advisers since the beginning of 2005 and continued to provide all the necessary support to the Data Processing Centres and headquarters. The services of the former CTA and Data Processing Adviser for the 1991 Census were availed through the support from UNFPA since September, 2006. He undertook four missions until July, 2008. The services of an expert on census advocacy and public awareness measures were made available by EU to the Commission from early 2005. The expert continued to support the census operation until October, 2006. A fulltime Cartography Consultant was recruited by EU and oversaw the Cartography and Enumeration Area Demarcation work since February, 2005 until July, 2006. Prior to the engagement of the EU expert, a very experienced Cartographer on African Censuses, from UNFPA, provided technical back-stopping in the early stages of Enumeration Area Demarcation and Census Frame during the period 2003-04. The same expert also participated as regular member of the EU Monitoring mission since last quarter of 2004 until May, 2006. The specialised services of two very experienced International Census Consultants cum Demographers were availed for conducting the Post Enumeration Survey.

Policies and Measures of Neutrality Adopted by the Commission

24.	The Commission adopted a policy of cross posting of the Federal Commissioners from north to south and vice versa, about three months prior to the commencement of the census. No State Di-rector was posted in his/her state of origin. Census Supervisors numbering over seventy thousand, who directly supervised the work of the enumerators were also cross posted or worked in a State other than their state of origin. During the process of recruitment of census functionaries, the rep-resentatives of Development Partners were on the selection committees to ensure free and fair se-lection. In addition to the Development Partners, any EU member country. Embassy or High Commission who wished to observe the Trial or Main Census enumeration were permitted by the Commission to do so.

25.	Thus from the foregoing it is clear that the Commission undertook every possible step to make the entire range of census process stand the test of public scrutiny time and again and to make it as transparent, credible and acceptable as was possible. The fact that it was done in a democratic regime makes this census still more creditable and trustworthy and there is no doubt that these efforts have helped the present Commission in breaking away from the jinx of the past controversies. It is never easy to make people believe that some things can be done conscientiously if there is dedication, honesty of purpose and the will to do it. This is because the past experience of the people has been different and it takes a Herculean effort not only to break away from the past inglorious history of census taking but a greater effort is required to make people realise that it can be and has been done now. The Commission has done its bit and shall continue to do so in the future to strengthen the roots of democracy and good governance in the country. It needs to be remembered that the 2006 Census Project was the single largest funded project by the EU in Nigeria and its success aids, abets and contributes positively to the efforts of the country to get itself good governance, reduce poverty and meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

Data Processing

26.	The huge work load and the challenges involved in data processing of the census questionnaire needs to be appreciated. Following the completion of the Held work of enumeration of the popula-tion end of March, 2006, Census forms canvassed were collected back from the enumerators at the LGA and state headquarters and were sent to the seven Data Processing Centres (DPCs). The seven DPCs are located at Lagos, Ibadan, Port Harcourt, Enugu, Kaduna, Kano and Yola and the census forms of the adjoining states based on geo-political proximity were processed in each DPC, beginning from April, 2006. This policy of processing the census forms, as far as possible in the same geo-political zone, was consciously adopted by the Commission to avoid any misunder-standing or trading of charges to manipulate the population figures for any administrative unit by any section of the stakeholders. To ensure that there is transparency and neutrality during the en-tire processing, the Data Processing Manager, technical officer in charge of DPC, responsible for data processing was from a different zone. The data processing staff in the DPC had representation from the constituent states for which the data was being processed in that DPC. The Federal Commissioners in-charge of the DPC were cross-posted from south to north and north to south. The IT Department from the headquarters supervised the entire archiving and scanning operations. Finally there were six resident international monitors at the DPCs, supported by the EU/UNFPA who supervised the full data processing, in addition to the two full-time international IT Advisers for technical backstopping. To ensure that the census forms and processed data were properly secured, both the physical and electronic security systems were put in place. Security personnel were placed round the clock at the entrance of all the DPCs and the entry was restricted to only authorised persons. The data processed at the DPCs was electronically encrypted before being finally processed.

Procedure Adopted by the National Population Commission for Acceptance of the Census Results

27.	It is important to note that for the acceptance of 2006 Census results every step as conceived in the law was followed meticulously in spirit and letter. The provisional results at national and state level for the 2006 Census were deliberated by the Commission, the body of thirty-eight Commissioners, on 29 December, 2006 and unanimously accepted. The Chairman delivered the census report to Mr. President at the State House, the same day, when all the Federal Commissioners and key officers of the Commission were present. In addition, the President had invited members of the Federal Executive Council, the Development Partners and the media for this occasion. The President directed the Chairman to announce to the world the provisional total population of the country. It is important to note that all these steps and proactive measures were undertaken to improve the transparency, credibility and accountability of the 2006 Census.

28.	The President having satisfied himself with the census report presented to him, convened a meeting of the Council of State on 9 January, 2007, to advise him whether to accept or reject the said report. The Chairman along with three key officials were present for this extraordinary and historic meeting and were witnesses to its proceedings. The Council of State unanimously advised the President to accept the 2006 Census provisional results and it was accordingly accepted by the President. There was not a single dissenting voice to oppose the acceptance of the census results, a singular phenomenon in a democratic set up and speaks volumes for itself about the manner in which the Commission conducted the affairs of census taking. It is important to note that the former Presidents and Heads of Government, former Chief Justices, President of the Senate, Speaker of the House of the Representatives, Governors and Attorney General of the Federation, who constitute the Council of State, were present for this meeting and gave their unanimous nod and assent for acceptance of the 2006 Census provisional results. In accordance with the constitutional provisions, copies of the census report were laid down before each of the Houses of the National Assembly by the President and the contents officially gazetted on 19 January, 2007. Thus every aspect of the constitutional provisions was followed to the core and all legal aspects duly complied with, in addition to the tremendous amount of transparency, credibility and accountability measures taken to ensure a wide acceptability of the census results within and outside Nigeria. The Commission (the body of thirty-eight Commissioners), the Federal Government and majority of the national and international stakeholders have accepted the 2006 Census provisional results not only because the results captured and exhibited a fair representation of the national, regional and state population size and distribution but also due to the transparent and credible publicly scrutinised measures adopted during the preparation, conduct and data processing of the census. It may be noted that the provisional results providing a further breakdown of the national and state results up to the Local Government Area (LGA) level were accepted by the President on 21 April and officially gazetted on 15 May, 2007.

Final Population Results

29.	After the provisional results were accepted by the Federal Government, while most representations received by the Commission commended it for successfully conducting the census, some have pointed out certain areas of concern as these affect them at the locality, LGA or state level. These petitions were examined administratively and due cognisance taken of in appropriate cases of any inadvertent and bona fide clerical, processing or technical error including reportedly uncovered areas pointed out or discovered by the Commission itself. For example, a mix up of the codes and phonetically similar names of LGAs Kaura and Kauru in Kaduna state led to substitution of their respective populations during the release of the provisional population totals and has now been rectified. All possible attempts have been made to provide workable solutions to the above by the Commission before finalising the results to the best of its ability in the prevailing circumstances and are appropriately addressed and reflected in the final results to facilitate the overall acceptability of the census results. The provisional results helped in assessing and resolving broadly the issue of ‘How many are we?’ The final population results therefor will go beyond the numbers and provide data in stages on the characteristics of the population and the conditions in which they live. Along with the final population totals by sex, some important population and housing characteristics are therefor being compiled. These will be duly presented as basic priority tables. The full volume of the tables when produced is considerable, given the number of population and housing variables canvassed during the census and it requires a great amount of painstaking effort, labour, skill and patience to examine these for consistency and validation. This will be done progressively.

30.	The deviation between the final and provisional population totals at the national, state and local government level is well within the acceptable demographic norms and absolute or percentage population difference is not significant. The relative rankings of the states do not exhibit any change though some states have gained nominally while others show very small overall decline. Since the local governments are of vastly differing population sizes, it is natural to experience relatively greater population fluctuations at this level. It is not possible to have exactly the same provisional and final population totals due to various technical reasons involved in data processing and its collation. An accurate and reliable census usually implies that the coverage and content of the census are fairly satisfactory in the given context and it evolves gradually for every country over a course of time and not instantaneously. No census exercise anywhere in the world is perfect in terms of coverage and content and the Commission is well aware that there is always a room for improvement while attempting concurrently to address these issues statistically. It is reiterated that Census, 2006 was a de facto census and that only those seen and found during the visit(s) of the enumerators were enumerated.

31.	It is important to recall that since the last census, there were significant administrative changes in the number of states and more so in the creation of new local governments. The creation of new  

states and LGAs would have influenced the population dynamics of in and out migration of varying degrees. By way of illustration, the impact due to the effective ‘physical relocation’ of the country’s capital to the centre of the country will be of a different magnitude than possibly establishing a new State capital. The precise nature, direction and quantum of changes in population movements not being uniform, are unlikely to be evenly distributed across states and the local governments within a state. This will therefor result in uneven growth rates contrary to or not consistent with or in accordance with political or public perceptions. There are many people who regale themselves in making population estimates (guesstimates or eye estimates) of a given area mostly to suit their own arguments, political or otherwise. If there was such an instantaneous population measuring instrument available, then there would be no need of any census taking and population estimates could be made for any place and in any point in time any where on this earth.

32.	The physical area of the seven hundred and seventy-four LGAs varies considerably, with the urban LGAs usually having relatively small areas and at times giving an erroneous impression of being crowded and having too many people. It is usually translated and misinterpreted into a very high and largely unrealistic population for the area in question. The consequences of mixing up wrongly the phenomenon of high population density (number of persons per square kilometre) according to this mind set leads them to falsely believe that it should necessarily result and translate in every case, a very high population size. This is compounded by the fact that due to commercial activities, markets or public utility activities (such as educational institutions, hospitals and public or private offices for example), the day time and week day population could be significantly different than the usual resident population eligible for enumeration on a de facto basis. Large cities and towns and their administrative and commercial areas are therefor usually prone to such boastings and (mis)interpretations and this may not occur unless these cities have large open and purely peripheral residential areas within their boundary limits. Thus in many cases the capacity of the area (city) to take endlessly additional population could be easily restricted due to the physical area and its changing use from residential to commercial or public utility purposes over a period of time. Technically speaking this could result into very low growth or even declines in population for an area.

33.	The rate of population growth witnessed will not be the same even if the natural population growth rate was the same for all local government areas (which is definitely not the case due to considerable differences in mortality and fertility rates, nuptial patterns, contraceptive use, educational levels and other factors). Differential level of over count, the variance in effect of census migration phenomenon peculiar to our censuses, and uncertainties of local and state government boundaries in certain cases in the two censuses need to be factored in while making an attempt to understand the population dynamics. In addition it is important to note that the country has witnessed during the intervening period of the two censuses, several disturbances due to political, social, ethnic and religious reasons in many areas. These have led to short term and or long term population migration and redistribution within and across states but it is very challenging to measure the quantum of population affected accurately, as some LGAs or their parts would have gained while others may have lost populations since the 1991 Census. This is the ground reality but it is not easily accepted by most. There is the stereotype thinking among several states and local governments that they are immune to out migration and only receive the in migrants. It may be recalled that some enumerating staff deployed by the Commission were killed while others were assaulted and chased away during the current census enumeration in certain parts of the country. In addition there would be an impact due to closure of certain industries and commercial ventures in one state or LGA and of establishment of new ones in new areas. An additional feature of population dynamics is the period of enumeration which was November-December in 1991 but was the month of March in 2006. Thus there could be an additional impact due to differential impact of seasonal migration and movement of population within and across states and even through international borders.

34.	Taking into account all these factors, it will be prudent for all concerned but more so for the political elite, the traditional rulers, the religious leaders and the academicians to cautiously and patiently interpret the census results and air their considered opinion for public consumption with considerable degree of restraint as it befits their position in the society. That the country’s interest and its unity and integrity are paramount over regional, ethnic or local interests need not be reiter-ated to such a formidable and experienced section of the opinion forming leaders. The Commission expects a mature assessment and scientific analysis of the 2006 Census rather than emotional and sentimental expressions and outbursts with wild population guesstimates sprinkled in between. Any valid and sound criticism(s) which lead to improvements in census taking and making it apolitical, will certainly be warmly welcomed and duly acknowledged by the Commission. This is because of the inherent merits of logical and rationale analysis rising above any parochial interest and in the long run establishing the principles of census taking as being a purely administrative and statistical exercise devoid of the political undertones it has suffered for so long in our country.

35.	The data dissemination policy has been fine tuned and plans are ready to facilitate optimum use of this wealth of data for national and local planning and monitoring of various targets and policies enshrined and articulated by the Federal and state governments. It is also expected that these data sets will assist the governments at all levels to allocate and appropriate scarce and competing financial and other resources more gainfully and judiciously based on facts rather than on presumptions.

36.	While it is desirable to produce small area population data, it appears that it may take more time than expected due to the challenges involved. Locality lists provided or available, truly lack stan-dardisation and legal as well as administrative authority to be used for census purposes. Localities could mean settlements of various types and population sizes, permanent, temporary or seasonal, villages, traditional councils and autonomous communities, cutting across one or several LGAs fully or partially, depending on the context in which these are being referred to such as for planning or electoral or administrative purposes. On examination of the information collected and collated from various sources before and after the census, it appears that such a list of localities is yet to be established unambiguously. This is partly due to historical reasons of traditional and social administrative hierarchies practiced and still in vogue, wide differences in settlement patterns and their nomenclature in different parts of the country, absence of clearly defined boundaries, differ-ences in perception of what constitutes rural and urban settlements, etc. An attempt by the National Population Commission to identify, list and classify localities before and during the commencement of the EAD exercise in consultation with the Chairmen of all the local governments over a period of three years could not resolve this issue satisfactorily.

37.	As a result, the Commission brought this to the notice of the President and requested for setting up in August, 2007 an Inter-Agency Ad-Hoc Committee on Compendium of Localities for Nigeria to resolve this national issue. The President accordingly approved this request of the Commission and directed the Secretary to the Government of Federation (SGF) to constitute such a group in September, 2007. An Inter-ministerial Committee from the following agencies - National Space Research Development Agency (NASRDA), National Boundary Commission (NBC), Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC), National Population Commission (NPOPC), Office of the Surveyor General of the Federation (OSGOF), and Office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (OSGF) was duly constituted. This committee also requested the Association of Local Governments of Nigeria (ALGON), Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and Nigeria Postal Services (NIPOST) as the principal data users of locality list, to assist it in resolving this contentious issue. The Committee, through the National Population Commission, submitted its interim report in December, 2007, to the President. One of its important findings clearly brought out the fact that various agencies were using different locality list for the same LGA, none of which appeared to be updated, complete or unambiguous by itself, with the locality list in possession of the National Population Commission possibly the most comprehensive among all the agencies. It also recommended that it was desirable to establish a national list of all localities in the country as an essential tool for good governance and the Federal Government should fund the working of this Inter-Agency Committee on the Compendium of List of Localities for Nigeria. An approval from the Federal Government on the implementation of recommendations of this report is being awaited by the Commission to enable it to use it for census purposes. Therefor the work relating to small area population data will be undertaken progressively by the Commission.

38.	Another issue that could not be fully resolved by the Commission was about acceptable resolutions of the many disputed areas which surfaced during the demarcation and or enumeration exercise. The disputed areas are between a State and another neighbouring country, between two or more states, between LGAs within a State and between two localities or communities within the LGA. Every attempt was made to demarcate such designated ‘disputed areas’, some how or the other and enumerate and account for them appropriately in the results. For example, the disputed areas relating to Ussa and Ta- kum LGAs in Taraba state were indicated separately dining the provisional results while that between LGAs Adavi and Okchi in Kogi state have now been accounted for in the final results. It became apparent that the best the Commission could attempt was to demarcate and enumerate these disputed areas to complete the census exercise and account for them suitably but leave their legal adjudication to the appropriate authorities. This is because of the very contentious and volatile nature of the disputes and the disputing parties and possibility of the accusation of a biased solution by the Commission from the contending parties. Several of these disputes have been in existence for generations and have taken hundreds of innocent lives. These disputes as and when appropriately resolved and adjudicated through legal or other measures can be taken note of again by the Commission and necessary rectification made in appropriate cases.

39.	The Commission would once again like to place on record its deep gratitude and sense of appre-ciation to all the stakeholders within and outside government in every part of Nigeria and those living abroad who contributed immensely in making this census happen at every stage. The fruits of this national effort are meant for the benefit of every one of our countrymen and women to facilitate good governance, strengthen democracy, assist in reduction of poverty and provide meaningful data for uplifting the lives of fellow Nigerians.

34.	Disciplinary action while criminal proceedings pending

If criminal proceedings are instituted against an officer in any court of law, disciplinary proceedings upon any grounds involved in the criminal charge may be taken only after the conclusion of the criminal proceedings and the determination of any appeal therefrom and then only if, having regard to the provisions of regulation 39 of these Regulations, the case is one in which disciplinary proceedings may properly be taken.

35.	Interdiction: when permissible

If disciplinary proceedings for an officer’s dismissal (including any disciplinary proceedings with a view to dismissal instituted or continued in pursuance of regulation 39 of these Regulations) are instituted or are about to be instituted or if criminal proceedings are instituted against an officer, and if the Commission considers that the interests of the judicial service require that such officer should cease forthwith to exercise the powers and functions of his office, the Commission may—

(a)	if the officer holds an appointment other than a temporary appointment, interdict him; or

(b)	if the officer holds a temporary appointment, terminate his appointment by payment of the appropriate remuneration in lieu of notice, but if such criminal proceedings result in his ac-quittal or such disciplinary proceedings (including any disciplinary proceedings with a view to dismissal instituted or continued in pursuance of regulation 41 of these Regulations) result otherwise than in his dismissal, he shall be re-engaged with effect from the date of such result or from the date following the expiration of the period for which he was paid remuneration in lieu of notice, whichever is the earlier.

(2)	Where the Chief Justice or the President or the Chief Judge, as the case may be is satisfied, after considering the report and recommendations of the Chief Registrar, that an officer should be interdicted under regulation 35 of these Regulations, he may order the officer to cease to exercise any of his powers and functions and the Chief Justice or the President or the Chief Judge, as the case may be, shall cause the case to be reported to the Commission which may confirm or otherwise deal with it.

(3)	If an officer is interdicted he shall be informed that he has been interdicted and the interdiction shall date from the time he is so informed.

37.	Officer not to leave his station without permission

(1)	Any officer who is under interdiction shall not leave his station without the permission of the chairman, and shall keep the Chief Registrar informed of the address at which instructions to him can be delivered; if he fails to comply with instructions delivered at such address within twenty-four hours of such delivery, he shall be regarded as being absent from duty without leave.

(2)	Where an officer under interdiction has received permission from the chairman to leave his sta-tion, any conditions imposed by the chairman in respect of his so leaving shall be complied with by him and failure to do so may be dealt with as misconduct for which disciplinary proceedings may be instituted under these Regulations.

38.	Salary during interdiction

(1)	An officer who is under interdiction shall, subject to the provisions of regulation 40 of these Regulations, receive such salary, not being less than half his salary, as the Commission shall think fit.

39.	Disciplinary procedure after acquittal or discharge on a criminal charge

(1)	An officer acquitted of a criminal charge in any court of law shall not be dismissed or otherwise punished on any charge upon which he has been acquitted, but nothing in this Regulation shall prevent his being dismissed or otherwise punished on any other charge arising out of his conduct in the matter, unless such charge raises substantially the same issues as those on which he has been acquitted.

(2)	In the event of the acquittal, or of the discharge, whether amounting to an acquittal or not, of an officer who has been charged with a criminal offence the Chief Registrar shall consider whether he should recommend the institution or continuance of disciplinary proceedings against such officer, but before recommending the institution or continuance of disciplinary proceedings in pursuance of this Regulation he shall, after consultation with the Chief Justice or the President or the Chief Judge, as the case may be, refer the matter to the Solicitor-General of the Federation for an opinion as to whether or not disciplinary proceedings can properly be instituted or continued under these Regulations.

(3)	In the event of a discharge which does not amount to an acquittal the Chief Registrar shall, before referring the matter to the Solicitor-General as provided under sub-regulation (2) of this Regulation, ascertain from the Director of Public Prosecutions of the Federation that further criminal proceedings against the officer are not proposed.

40.	No payment of salary on conviction

An officer adjudged by a court of law to be guilty of a criminal offence shall not receive any emoluments from the date of such judgment, pending the decision of the Commission.

41.	Disciplinary action after conviction

If an officer is convicted of a criminal offence the Chief Registrar shall make a recommendation to the Commission as to whether the officer should be dismissed or subjected to some lesser penalty on account of his conviction for the offence of which he has been adjudged guilty, and shall submit with his recommendation a copy of the charge or charges and of the judgment (and the proceedings of the court, if they are available at the time he makes his recommendations, and if they are not, and if the

Commission asks to see them, when they become available) and the Commission may inflict such pun-ishment upon the officer as may seem proper to the Commission without following the procedure pre-scribed in regulation 44,46 or 48 of these Regulations.

42.	Absence without leave or reasonable cause

(1)	Without prejudice to the power to institute disciplinary proceedings in respect of any absence from duty without leave or reasonable cause, where an officer is absent from duty without leave or rea-sonable cause, the Commission may dismiss him without following the procedure prescribed in regulation 44 of these Regulations.

(2)	An officer shall be considered and treated for all purposes as having been dismissed from service by the very fact, and from the very date, of his having committed any of the following acts or omissions—

(ia)	absenting himself from duty without leave or reasonable cause and in circumstances evincing

an intention on his part no longer to continue in the service; or

{b) resigning or purporting to resign his appointment without having first given due notice, and serving for the period of the notice of such resignation, or else paying in lieu thereof in ac-cordance with the provisions applicable in the circumstance:

Provided that if the officer concerned can later satisfy the Commission that the circumstances of his having committed any of the acts or omissions aforementioned do not justify his dismissal from the judicial service, the Commission may, without prejudice to the power to institute disciplinary proceedings in respect of such acts or omissions and with a view to a lesser punishment than dismissal being imposed, revoke the dismissal.

{d) to defer or withhold increments, without proceedings under regulation 47 of these Regulations or in pursuance of regulation 50 of these Regulations.

44.	Procedure for dismissal of officers

(1)	Whenever the Chief Justice or the President or the Chief Judge, as the case may be, considers it necessary to institute disciplinary proceedings against an officer and he is of the opinion that the mis-conduct alleged against the officer is such as would, if proved, justify the officer’s dismissal from the service, the following provisions shall apply—

(a)	the Chief Registrar shall prepare and forward to the officer a brief statement of the facts on which the allegation against him is based and shall call on him to state in writing before a day to be specified (which day shall allow a reasonable interval for the purpose) any grounds upon which he relies to exculpate himself;

(3)	In the event of a Committee being appointed as stated in sub-regulation (2) (c) of this Regulation—

(a)	the committee shall inform the accused officer that on a specified day the charge against him will be investigated by them and that he will be allowed or, if the Committee shall so determine, will be required, to appear before them to defend himself;

(g)	the Commission after considering the report and any further evidence before it shall then decide on the guilt or responsibility of the officer on the allegations made against him and if the officer is not exonerated shall decide on the punishment to be inflicted and the decision on each allegation made against the accused officer (but not the reasons for the decision) shall be communicated to him.

45.	Removal for general inefficiency arising from proceedings instituted for dismissal

On completion of proceedings instituted for the dismissal of an officer, the Commission may, if of opinion that the officer does not deserve to be dismissed but that the proceedings disclosed grounds for removing him on account of general inefficiency in the performance of his duties, terminate his appointment.

46.	Documentary evidence and supplying of copies of evidence

(1)	No documentary evidence shall be used at or for the purpose of an inquiry under regulation 44 of these Regulations without the accused officer having first had, a reasonable time beforehand, an op-portunity to receive a copy thereof, for which copy no charge shall be made, or an opportunity of access thereto.

(2)	After an inquiry has been closed, the accused officer may be given a copy of the record of the evidence led (including copies of documents tendered in evidence) on payment of such amount as the Commission may specify, regard being had to the labour and cost of producing such document.

47.	Procedure for lesser punishment than dismissal of officer

Where the Chief Justice or the President or the Chief Judge, as the case may be, considers it necessary to institute disciplinary proceedings against an officer and is of the opinion that the misconduct alleged against the officer is not such as would, if proved, justify the officer’s dismissal from the service, the following provisions shall apply—

{a) the Chief Registrar shall, on the direction of the Chief Justice or the President or the Chief Judge, as the case may be, report the case together with a statement of his opinion and the reasons for it to the Commission;

Provided that nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the Commission from ordering the removal from the judicial service, on grounds of inefficiency, of an officer who has been confirmed in a pensionable office where the Commission is of opinion upon the completion of proceedings instituted for the dismissal of the officer that the officer does not deserve to be dismissed but that the proceedings disclose grounds for removing him on account of inefficiency, in which event it shall not be necessary to comply with the main provisions of this Regulation.

(i)	where an officer’s probationary period has been reduced to less than two years or where a contract officer is appointed for a shorter period than two years, the number of reports to be rendered on periods of six month’s service shall be correspondingly reduced and references to a final report shall be construed accordingly, so that in any case a final report shall be rendered not later than two months before a probationary period or four months before a period of contract service is to expire;

(ii)	where an officer’s probationary period has been extended beyond two years, a separate report, to be known as an Additional Performance Evaluation Report, shall be rendered, not later than six weeks after the end of the period to which it relates, on each period of six months’ service under such extension.

59.	Annual Performance Evaluation Reports

(1) Annual Performance Evaluation Reports shall be rendered on every officer who—

(a) holds an office to which this Part of these Regulations applies; and

(ib)	is not an officer in respect of whom regulation 58 (1) of these Regulations requires a Per

formance Evaluation Report to be rendered or an officer holding a temporary appointment:

Provided that it shall not be necessary to render an Annual Performance Evaluation Report in respect of an officer on whom a Performance Evaluation Report has been rendered less than four months before the end of the period for which an Annual Performance Evaluation Report would have been required.

(2)	Annual Performance Evaluation Reports on officers shall be rendered to the Commission by the Chief Registrar and in such form as the Commission may prescribe.

(3)	The procedure for the rendering of Annual Performance Evaluation Reports on officers shall be as follows—

(a)	an Annual Performance Evaluation Report shall be rendered in respect of each period of twelve months ending on 31 December, or subject to the proviso to sub-regulation (1) of this Regulation, any part of that period during which an officer has held an office in respect of which sub-regulation (1) of this Regulation requires that an Annual Performance Evaluation Report shall be rendered on him to the Commission;

(b)	in the first week of January each year, or earlier if he will then be on leave or if the Chief Registrar requires him to take earlier action, every officer on whom an Annual Performance Evaluation Report is required by this Regulation shall complete, sign and date the part he is required to complete of the prescribed number of copies of prescribed forms and, if he is the Chief Registrar, shall deliver the copies to the Chief Justice or the President or the Chief Judge, as the case may be or, if he is not, shall deliver them to the officer to whom he is immediately responsible;

(c)	an officer required by regulation 61 of these Regulations to write a report may require other officers to provide written material for a report on the officer on whom the report is required;

(d)	the prescribed number of copies of the report duly completed as required by regulation 61 of these Regulations shall be delivered to the Commission not later than 1 January following the period in respect of which the report is rendered.

Special Performance Evaluation Reports and Supplementary Performance Evaluation Reports shall be rendered on any officer at any time at the request of the Commission or of the Chief Registrar and shall have such title and be in such form as the Commission may prescribe.

61.	By whom reports to Commission to be written

(1)	Performance Evaluation Reports rendered to the Commission shall be written by the immediate su-pervisor of the officer reported upon and (except in the case of the Chief Registrar) by the Chief Registrar.

(2)	Where the holder of an office charged with responsibility for writing a Performance Evaluation Report knows that he will be temporarily absent from such office at the time a report is due to be written, he shall write the report and submit it as these Regulations may require before he leaves his office.

(3)	Where posting to an office, the substantive holder of which is charged with responsibility for writing a Performance Evaluation Report, would result in an officer assuming responsibility within the last one-third of the period to which the report is to relate for writing a report on another officer of whom he has had no official knowledge immediately prior to his own posting, the officer vacating the office shall write the report before he leaves and shall deliver it to the officer who succeeds him, and the latter officer shall submit the report when it becomes due with such signed alterations, if any, as he shall think fit.

(4)	Where the posting of an officer would result in another officer assuming, after the beginning of the period to which the report is to relate, responsibility for writing upon such officer as is first mentioned, and neither sub-regulation (2) nor (3) of these Regulations applies, any other officer under whom the officer to be reported on served for one-third or more of the period, and who would have been responsible for writing the report had the officer to be reported on continued to serve under him shall, at the request of the officer assuming responsibility, provide that officer with written material for a report on the officer to be reported on (in which case the fact that such comments have been taken into account shall be recorded in the report) or shall, if so requested by the Chief Registrar, write the report.

(5)	Where an officer assumes responsibility within the last one-third of the period to which the report is to relate for writing a report on another officer of whom he has had no official knowledge immediately prior to his own posting, the officer vacating the office shall write the report before he leaves and shall deliver it to the officer who succeeds him, and the latter officer shall submit the report when it becomes due with such signed alterations, if any, as he shall think fit.

(6)	Where it is impossible to comply with sub-regulation (1) or (2) of this Regulation and compliance with sub-regulation (3), (4) or (5) of this Regulation would be inappropriate, the Chief Registrar shall after consultation with the Chief Justice or the President or the Chief Judge, as the case may be, make what appears to him to be the most suitable arrangement possible for the writing of a report and the circumstances shall be explained in the report.

62.	Reports on officers on training courses

Where an officer has, during a period or part of a period in respect of which a Performance Evaluation Report is to be rendered, been absent from his office for the purpose of training, the Chief Registrar may obtain such reports from the authorities in charge of such training as may facilitate the writing of a Performance Evaluation Report in compliance as nearly as possible with these Regulations.

63.	Reports to be dated and signed

Every Performance Evaluation Report (including any endorsement of or alteration in or addition to a report) shall be dated and shall be signed in full by the Reporting Officer who shall append his rank or acting rank below his signature.

64.	Communication of Reports to officers; comments and discussion with officer

The Performance Evaluation Report on an officer’s work and conduct shall be signed by him to in-dicate that he has seen it and he may make in the prescribed manner such comments on the report as he thinks fit and such comments shall be discussed with him by the Reporting Officer or the Chief Registrar, as the case may be.

65.	Custody and transmission of Reports and retention of copies

(1)	An officer who is writing, has written, or has custody of a Performance Evaluation Report, or to whom a report is delivered, or into whose possession a report comes in any manner whatsoever, shall en-sure that it is seen or retained only by the authority to which it is rendered in accordance with these Regu-lations, or by an officer authorised by the Chief Registrar acting in accordance with sub-regulation (3) of this Regulation, to see or retain it, as the case may be.

(2)	An officer sending a Performance Evaluation Report to the Commission or to another officer shall cover, address and transmit it in such a manner as shall ensure that it is not seen by any person who has not been authorised to see it by the Commission or by the officer to whom it is addressed.

(3)	No copy of a Performance Evaluation Report shall be retained by a Reporting Officer: 

Provided that the Chief Registrar may retain one copy of any report rendered to the Commission on an officer on condition that he arranges for the custody under his personal supervision of such reports in such manner as shall ensure compliance with sub-regulation (1) of this Regulation.

66.	Official testimonials

The Chief Registrar may, subject to the Commission’s approval of the terms of any testimonial relating to an officer, issue official testimonials to prospective employers of officers or former officers at the request of such prospective employers but shall issue to an officer or a former officer himself only the Certificate of Service under regulation 67 of these Regulations.

Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria {Promulgation) Act - Subsidiary Legislation

69.	Removal and discipline of judicial officers

(1)	Whenever the Chief Justice or the President or the Chief Judge, as the case may be, is of the opin-ion that disciplinary proceedings ought to be instituted against a judicial officer (other than the Chief Jus-tice of Nigeria) with a view to the Commission making a recommendation to the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria for his removal from office in accordance with the provisions of section 256 (1) (b) of the Constitution, or with a view to the Commission imposing some other disciplinary measure on him for misconduct or breach of the Code of Conduct, the following provisions shall apply—

(EDITORIAL NOTE: Wording as per Gazette. This sub-regulation refers to

section 256 (1) (b), however, this section was not published in this Act.)

(2)	A recommendation shall not be made to the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria for the removal of a judicial officer from office unless the Commission is satisfied after due enquiry that the judicial officer is unable to discharge the functions of his office or appointment (whether arising from infirmity of mind or body) or that he is guilty of misconduct or contravention of the Code of Conduct.

(3)	Misconduct for which disciplinary action may be instituted includes such misconduct or misbe-haviour which in the opinion of the Commission is incompatible with a judicial office or unbecoming of the holder of such office.

[No. 21 of 1990.]

(2)	Where under these Rules any person has given an address for service, any notice or other written communication which is not required to be served personally shall be sufficiently served upon him if it is left at that address or sent by registered post to that address, and in any case where the date of service by post is material, section 26 of the Interpretation Act shall apply.

[Cap. 123.]

(3)	Where under these Rules any notice or other application to the Court, or to the court below, is required to have an address for service endorsed on it, it shall not be deemed to have been properly filed unless such an address is endorsed on it.

(4)	Any person desiring to change his address for service shall notify the Registrar, who shall thereupon communicate the new address for service to anyone to who he may have communicated the former address.

2.	Duty of legal practitioner where he no longer acts for parties

Where any person has given the address of a legal practitioner as his address for service and the legal practitioner is not or has ceased to be instructed by him for the purpose of the proceedings concerned, it shall be the duty of the legal practitioner to inform the Registrar as soon as may be that he is not or no longer authorised to accept service on behalf of such person, and if he omits to do so he may be ordered to pay any costs occasioned thereby.

3.	Personal service: where necessary

(1) Except as may be otherwise provided in these Rules or in any other written law, no notice or other written communication in proceedings in the original or appellate jurisdiction of the Court, need be served personally except—

{a) in proceedings in the original jurisdiction of the Court, the writ of summons or other documents issued by the Court for the institution of the proceedings; and

(b)	in proceedings in the appellate jurisdiction of the Court, the notice of appeal:

Provided that if the Court is satisfied that the notice of appeal has in fact been served in the manner prescribed by sub-rule (2) of this Rule, and communicated to the respondent, no objection to the hearing of the appeal shall lie on the ground only that the notice of appeal was not served personally.

(2) Where any document is required by these Rules to be served personally, it shall be sufficiently served if it is served in the manner prescribed by law for the personal service of a writ of summons issued by the Federal High Court and if it appears to the Court that for any reason personal service cannot be conveniently effected, the Court shall have the same power as that High Court to direct that service be effected in some other way.

4.	Service of notice of appeal

The Registrar of the court below shall, after the notice of appeal has been filed, cause to be served a true copy thereof upon each of the parties mentioned in the notice of appeal. It shall not be necessary to serve any party not directly affected:

Provided that in criminal cases, service on the Attorney-General of the Federation or on the At-torney-General of a State (as the case may require) shall be deemed to be good and sufficient service on the respondent in a criminal appeal other than an appeal in a private prosecution.

5.	Filing of address for service

(1)	Every person who by virtue of service on him of a notice of appeal becomes a respondent to any appeal or intended appeal shall within thirty days after service on him of the notice of appeal file with the Registrar of the court below notice of a full and sufficient address for service in such number of copies as the said Registrar shall require and the Registrar of the court below shall forthwith send a copy of the no-tice of address to the Registrar and shall cause a copy thereof to be served on the appellant.

(2)	Such notice may be signed by the respondent or the legal practitioner representing him.

(3)	If any respondent fails or omits to file such notice of address for service, then delivery of any document or proceedings at the address shown in the notice of appeal shall be deemed to be good and proper service on him.

6.	Service on Government, Minister or the Attorney-General

[No. 21 of 1990.]

(2)	Every application for an order for leave to serve a summons on a defendant out of the jurisdiction shall be supported by evidence by affidavit or otherwise showing in what place or country such defendant is or probably may be found, and the grounds upon which the application is made.

(3)	Any order giving leave to effect service out of the jurisdiction shall prescribe the mode of service, and shall limit a time after such service within which such defendant is to enter an appearance, such time to depend on the place or country where or within which the summons is to be served, and the Court may receive an affidavit or statutory declaration of such service having been effected as prima facie evidence thereof.

8.	Title of proceedings

Notices of appeal, applications for leave to appeal, briefs and all other documents whatsoever pre-pared in pursuance of the appellate jurisdiction of the Court for filing in accordance with the provisions of these Rules, shall reflect the same title as that which obtained in the court of trial.

[G.N. Ill of 1991.]

9.	Preliminary objections

(1)	A respondent intending to rely upon a preliminary objection to the hearing of the appeal shall give the appellant three clear days’ notice thereof before the hearing, setting out the grounds of objection, and shall file such notice together with ten copies thereof with the Registrar within the same time.

(2)	If the respondent fails to comply with this Rule, the Court may refuse to entertain the objection or may adjourn the hearing thereof at the cost of the respondent or may make such other order as it thinks fit.

(3)	No objection shall be taken to the hearing of an appeal on the ground that the amounts fixed by the Registrar of the court below under rule 3 (1) of Order VII were incorrectly assessed.

10.	Declaration by party not appearing

At any time before hearing of the appeal any party to the appeal may file a declaration in writing that he does not wish to be present in person or represented by a legal practitioner on the hearing of the appeal, and he shall serve a copy of such declaration upon every other party who has filed an address for service and thereupon the appeal shall be dealt with as if the party had appeared.

11.	Non-appearance of appellant or respondent

(1)	Subject to the provisions of these Rules, if the appellant fails to appear when his appeal is called on for hearing the appeal may be dismissed with or without costs as the case may be and if the respondent fails to appear the Court may proceed to hear the appeal ex parte.

(2)	When an appeal has been dismissed under this Rule, the Court may, in civil proceedings on such terms as to costs or otherwise as it may deem just, direct the appeal to be re-entered for hearing.

(3)	Where an appeal has been heard ex parte under this Rule and any judgment has been given therein adverse to the respondent, he may apply to the Court and the Court may, in civil proceedings, set aside such judgment and rehear the appeal.

(4)	No application to set aside and rehear under this Rule shall be made after the expiration of twenty-one days from the date of the judgment sought to be set aside:

Provided that a respondent who has failed within the aforesaid period to make application under this Rule may, nevertheless at any time within a further period of three months thereafter, apply to the Court on notice to the appellant to set aside such judgment, and the Court may, where exceptional cir-cumstance is shown, grant the application and make such order in relation thereto or as to costs as it may deem fit in the circumstances. 

(5)	Any application under sub-rules (3) and (4) of this Rule shall be by motion accompanied by an affidavit setting forth the reasons and grounds for the application and a brief of argument filed simulta-neously. The court may, acting under sub-rule (3) of this Rule set aside the judgment and order the appeal to be reheard at such time and upon such conditions as to costs or otherwise as it may think fit.

[G.N. Ill of 1991.]

12.	Procedure for receiving further evidence on appeal

(1)	A party who wishes the Court to receive the evidence of witnesses (whether they were or were not called at the trial) or to order the production of any document, exhibit or other thing connected with the proceedings in accordance with the provisions of section 33 of the Act, shall apply for leave on notice of motion prior to the date set down for the hearing of the appeal.

(2)	The application shall be supported by affidavit of the facts on which the party relies for making it and of the nature of the evidence or the document concerned.

13.	Fees generally

(1)	As early as possible before the date set down for the hearing of the appeal, and in any event, not later than one week before such date, the party who has filed a brief or the legal practitioner representing him shall forward to the Registrar in charge of litigation a list of the law reports, text books and other authorities which counsel intend to cite at the hearing of the appeal.

8.	Oral argument

(1)	Subject to the provisions of rule 3 of these Rules, oral argument will be allowed at the hearing of the appeal to emphasise and clarify the written argument appearing in the briefs already filed in court.

(7)	When an appeal is called, and it is discovered that a brief has been filed for only one of the par-ties and neither of the parties concerned nor their legal practitioners appear to present oral argument, the appeal shall be regarded as having been argued on that brief.

9.	Failure to file brief within time

If an appellant fails to file and serve his brief within the time provided for in rule 5 of these Rules, or within the time as extended by the Court, the respondent may apply to the Court for the appeal to be struck out for want of prosecution. If the respondent fails to file his brief, he will not be heard in oral argument except by leave of the Court.

[G.N. Ill of 1991.]

10.	Power of Court to accelerate hearing in exceptional circumstances

21.	Default by third party

If a third party duly served with a third party notice does not enter an appearance or makes default in filing any pleading which he has been ordered to file, he shall be deemed to admit any claim stated in the third party notice and shall be bound by any judgment given in the action, whether by consent or otherwise, and by any decision therein or any question specified in the action, and when contribution or indemnity or other relief for remedy is claimed against him in the notice, he shall be deemed to admit his liability in respect of the contribution or indemnity or other relief or remedy.

(a)	where the liability of the third party to the defendant giving the notice is established on the hearing of the application, order such judgment as the nature of the case may require to be entered against the third party in favour of the defendant giving the notice; or

(b)	if satisfied that there is a question or issue properly to be tried as between the plaintiff and the defendant and the third party or between any or either of them as to the liability of the de-fendant to the plaintiff or as to the liability of the third party to make any contribution or in-demnity claimed, in whole or in part, or as to any other relief or remedy claimed in the notice by the defendant or that a question or issue stated in the notice should be determined not only as between the plaintiff and the defendant but as between the plaintiff, the defendant and the third party or any or either of them, order that question or issue to be tried in such manner as the Court or Judge in Chambers may direct; or

(c)	dismiss the application.

25.	At trial or after

ORDER XXIV

The undefended list

1.	Undefended list: affidavit

Whenever application is made to a Court for the issue of a writ of summons in respect of a claim to recover a debt or liquidated money demand and the application is supported by an affidavit setting forth the grounds upon which the claim is based and stating that in the deponent’s belief there is no defence thereto, the Court shall, if satisfied that there are grounds for believing that there is no defence thereto, enter the suit for hearing in what shall be called the 'Undefended List”, and mark the writ of summons accordingly, and enter thereon a date for hearing suitable to the circumstances of the particular case.

2.	Copy of affidavit to be served

There shall be delivered by the plaintiff to the Registrar upon the issue of the writ of summons as aforesaid, as many copies of the above-mentioned affidavit as there are parties against whom relief is sought, and the Registrar shall annex one such copy to each copy of the writ of summons for service.

3.	Notice of intention to defend

(1)	If the party served with the writ of summons and affidavit delivers to the Registrar, not less than five days before the day fixed for hearing, a notice in writing that he intends to defend the suit together with an affidavit disclosing a defence on the merit, the Court may give him leave to defend upon such terms as the Court may think just.

(2)	Where leave to defend is given under this Rule, the action shall be removed from the Undefended List and placed on the ordinary Cause List and the Court may order pleadings, or proceed to hearing without further pleadings.

4.	Judgment in undefended suit

Where any defendant neglects to deliver the notice of defence and affidavit prescribed by rule 3(1) of this Order, or is not given leave to defend by the Court, the suit shall be heard as an undefended suit, and judgment given thereon, without calling upon the plaintiff to summon witnesses before the Court to prove his case formally.

(2)	A point of law so raised may, by consent of the parties, or by order of the Court or a Judge in Chambers on the application of either party, be set down for hearing and disposed of at any time before the trial.

3.	Dismissal of action

If, in the opinion of the Court or a Judge in Chambers the decision of the point of law substantially disposes of the whole action, or of any distinct cause of action, ground of defence, set-off, counterclaim, or reply therein, the Court or Judge in Chambers may thereupon dismiss the action or make such other order therein as may be just.

4.	Striking out pleading where no reasonable cause of action disclosed

The Court or a Judge in Chambers may order any pleading to be struck out on the ground that it dis-closes no reasonable cause of the action or defence being shown by the pleadings to be frivolous or vexatious, the Court or a Judge in Chambers may order the action to be stayed or dismissed, or judgment to be entered accordingly, as may be just.

5.	Declaratory j udgment

No action or proceeding shall be open to objection on the ground that a merely declaratory judgment or order is sought thereby, and the Court may make binding declarations of right whether any consequential relief is or could be claimed or not.

ORDER XXVI

Pleadings

1.	Service of statement of claim

Unless the Court gives leave to the contrary or a statement of claim is endorsed on the writ, the plain-tiff shall serve a statement of claim together with copies of documentary evidence therein mentioned on the defendant, or, if there are two or more defendants, on each defendant, and shall do so either when the writ, or notice of the writ, is served on the defendant unless the Court or Judge in Chambers otherwise orders.

2.	Service of defence

(1)	Subject to sub-rule (2) of this Rule, a defendant who enters an appearance in, and intends to de-fend, an action shall, unless the Court gives leave to the contrary, serve a defence which must include any preliminary objection he wishes to raise to the plaintiffs action together with copies of the documentary evidence therein mentioned on the plaintiff at the time he files his memorandum of appearance.

(2)	If a summons under Order XXIV rule 1 of these Rules is served on a defendant, sub-rule (1) of this Rule shall not have effect in relation to him unless by the order of Court made on a motion on notice he is given leave to defend the action and, in that case, shall have effect as if it required him to serve his defence within fourteen days after the making of the order or within such other period as may be specified in the order.

3.	Service of reply and defence to counterclaim

(1)	Where a plaintiff serves both a reply and a defence to counterclaim on any defendant, he shall include them in the same document.

4.	Pleading to state material facts and not evidence

(1)	Every pleading shall contain a statement in a summary form of the material facts on which the party pleading relies for his claims or defence, as the case may be, but not the evidence by which they are to be proved, and shall when necessary be divided into paragraphs, and numbered consecutively.

(2)	Dates, sums and numbers shall be expressed in figures but may also be expressed in words.

(3)	Pleadings shall be signed by a legal practitioner, or by the party if he sues or defends in person.

In all cases in which the party pleading relies on any misrepresentation, fraud, breach of trust, wilful default, or undue influence, and in all other cases in which particulars may be necessary, particulars (with dates and items if necessary) shall be stated in the pleadings.

6.	Matters which must be specifically pleaded

(1)	A party shall plead specifically any matter (for example, performance, release, any relevant statute of limitation, fraud or any fact showing illegality) which, if not specifically pleaded might take the opposite party by surprise.

(2)	Any condition precedent, the performance or occurrence of which is intended to be contested, shall be distinctly specified in his pleading by the plaintiff or the defendant, as the case may be; and, subject thereto, an averment of the performance or occurrence of all conditions precedent necessary for the case of the plaintiff or the defendant shall be implied in his pleading.

(3)	Without prejudice to sub-rule (1) of this Rule, a defendant in an action for the recovery of land shall plead specifically every ground of defence on which he relies and a plea that he is in possession of the land by himself or his tenant is not sufficient.

7.	Further and better statement or particulars

(1)	A further and better statement of the nature of the claim or defence, or further and better par-ticulars of any matter stated in any pleading, notice or written proceeding requiring particulars, may in all cases be ordered, upon such terms as to costs and otherwise, as may be just.

8.	Order for particulars not a stay

(1)	The party at whose instance particulars have been filed under a Judge’s order shall, unless the order otherwise provides, have the same length of time for pleading after the service of the particulars upon him that he had initially.

(2)	Except as provided in this Rule, an order for particulars shall not, unless the order otherwise provides, operate as a stay of proceedings or give any extension of time.

9.	Specific denial

Every allegation of fact in any pleading, not being a petition or summons, if not denied specifically or by necessary implication, or stated to be not admitted in the pleading of the opposite party, shall be taken to be admitted, except as against an infant, lunatic, or person of unsound mind not adjudged a lunatic.

10.	Denial by joinder of issue

(1)	If there is no reply to a defence, there is an implied joinder of issue on that defence.

(2)	Subject to sub-rule (3) of this Rule—

(b)	a party may in his pleadings expressly join issue on the last preceding pleading.

(3)	 There shall be no joinder of issue, implied or expressed, on a statement of claim or counterclaim.

(4)	A joinder of issue operates as a denial of every material allegation of fact made in the pleading on which there is an implied or express joinder of issue unless, in the case of an express joinder of issue, any such allegation is excepted from the joinder and is stated to be admitted, in which case, the express joinder of issue operates as a denial of every other such allegation.

11.	Pleadings to be consistent

No pleading, not being a petition or summons, shall, except by way of amendment, raise any new ground of claim or contain any allegation of fact inconsistent with the previous pleadings of the party pleading the same.

12.	Grounds of claim founded on separate facts to be separately stated

(1)	Where the plaintiff seeks relief in respect of several distinct claims or causes of complaint founded upon separate and distinct facts, they shall be stated, as far as may be, separately and distinctly.

(2)	The same rule shall apply where the defendant relies upon several distinct grounds of set-off or counterclaim founded upon separate and distinct facts.

The relief claimed to be stated

(3)	Every statement of claim shall state specifically the relief which the plaintiff claims, either simply or in the alternative, and may also ask for general relief and the same rule shall apply to any counterclaim made or relief claimed by the defendant in his defence.

13.	Allegations shall not be made generally but specifically

It shall not be sufficient to deny generally the facts alleged by the statement of claim, but the defendant shall deal specially with them, either admitting or denying the truth of each allegation of fact seriatim, as the truth or falsehood of each is within his knowledge, or (as the case may be) stating that he does not know whether any given allegation is true or otherwise.

14.	Denial of fact must answer point of substance

(1)	When a party denies all allegation of fact he shall not do so evasively, but shall answer the point of substance.

(2)	When a matter of fact is alleged with diverse circumstances it shall not be sufficient to deny it as alleged along with those circumstances, but a full and substantial answer shall be given. 

15.	Admissions

The defence shall admit such material allegations in the statement of claim as the defendant knows to be true, or desires to be taken as established without proof thereof.

16.	Set-off or counterclaim to be pleaded

Where any defendant seeks to rely upon any fact as supporting a right of set-off or counterclaim, he shall, in his statement of defence, state specifically that he does so by way of set-off or counterclaim as the case may be, and the particulars of such set-off or counterclaim shall be given.

17.	Evidence on denial of allegation or in support of defence not set up in pleading

The defence of a defendant shall not debar him at the hearing from disproving any allegation of the plaintiff not admitted by the defence, or from giving evidence in support of a defence not expressly set up by the defence, except where the defence is such as, in the opinion of the Court, ought to have been expressly set up by the defence, or is inconsistent with the statements thereof, or is, in the opinion of the Court, likely to take the plaintiff by surprise or to raise new issues not fairly arising out of the pleadings, as they stand, and such as the plaintiff ought not to be then called upon to meet.

18.	Further pleadings

The Court, if it considers that the statement of claim and the defence filed in any suit insufficiently disclose and fix the real issues between the parties, may order such further pleadings to be filed as it may deem necessary for the purpose of bringing the parties to an issue.

19.	Costs in certain cases

Where the Court is of opinion that any allegations of fact, denied or not admitted by any pleading, ought to have been admitted, the Court shall make such order as may be just with respect to costs.

20.	Striking out pleadings

The Court may at any time, on the application of either party, strike out any pleading or any part thereof, on the ground that it discloses no cause of action, or no defence to the action, as the case may be, or on the ground that it is embarrassing, or scandalous or vexatious, or an abuse of the process of the Court; and the Court may either give leave to amend the pleading, or may proceed to give judgment for the plaintiff or the defendant, as the case may be, or may make such other order, and upon such terms and conditions, as may seem just.

21.	Denial of contract

When a contract, promise, or agreement is alleged in any pleading, a bare denial of the same by the opposite party shall be construed only as a denial in fact of the express contract, promise, or agreement alleged, or the matters of fact from which the same may be implied by law, and not as a denial of the legality or sufficiency in law of the contract, promise, or agreement, whether with reference to any statute or otherwise.

22.	Effect of documents to be stated

Wherever the contents of any document are material, it shall be sufficient in any pleading to state the effect thereof as briefly as possible, without setting out the whole or any part thereof, unless the precise words of the document or any part thereof are material.

23.	Malice, knowledge, on other condition of mind

Wherever it is material to allege malice, fraudulent intention, knowledge, or other condition of the mind of any person, it shall be sufficient to allege it as a fact without setting out the circumstances from which it is inferred.

24.	Notice

Wherever it is material to allege notice to any person of any fact, matter or thing, it shall be sufficient to allege the notice as a fact, unless the form or the precise terms of the notice or the circumstances from which the notice is to be inferred, is material.

25.	Implied contract or relation

(1)	Whenever any contract or any relation between any persons is to be implied from a series of let-ters or conversations, or otherwise from a number of circumstances, it shall be sufficient to allege the contract or relation as a fact, and to refer generally to those letters, conversations or circumstances without setting them out in detail.

(2)	If, as in sub-rule (1) of this Rule, the person so pleading desires to rely in the alternative upon more contracts or relations than one as to be implied from those circumstances, he may state them in the alternative.

26.	Presumptions of law

Neither party needs in any pleading allege any matter of fact which the law presumes in his favour or as to which the burden of proof lies upon the other side, unless the same has first been specifically denied (such as consideration for a bill of exchange where the plaintiff sues only on the bill, and not for the consideration as a substantive ground of claim).

27.	Technical objection

No technical objection shall be raised to any pleading on the ground of any alleged want of form.

28.	Stated or settled account

In every case in which the cause of action is a stated or settled account, the same shall be alleged with particulars but in any case in which a statement of account is relied on by way of evidence or ad-mission of any other cause of action which is pleaded, the same need not be alleged in the pleadings.

29.	Defence of tender

Where in any action a defence of tender before action is pleaded, the defendant shall pay into court in accordance with rule 1 of Order XXXI of these Rules the amount alleged to have been tendered, and the tender shall not be available as a defence unless and until payment into court has been made.

30.	Defence of set-off

Where a claim by a defendant to a sum of money (whether of an ascertained amount or not) is relied on as a defence to the whole or part of a claim made by the plaintiff, it may be included in the defence and set-off against the plaintiffs claim, whether or not it is also added as a counterclaim.

31.	Judgment for balance

(1)	Where in any action a set-off or counterclaim is established as a defence against the plaintiffs claim, the Court may, if the balance is in favour of the defendant, give judgment for the defendant for the balance, or otherwise adjudge to the defendant such relief as he may be entitled to upon the merits of the case.

(2)	Sub-rule (1) of this Rule shall apply mutatis mutandis where the balance is in favour of the plaintiff.

3.	Several defendants; one default

When in any action for a debt or liquidated demand there are several defendants, and one of them makes default as mentioned in rule 2 of this Order the plaintiff may have final judgment entered against the defendant so making default, and issue execution upon that judgment without prejudice to his right to proceed with his action against the other defendants.

4.	Default of defence: claim for unliquidated damages

Where the plaintiffs claim against a defendant is for unliquidated damages only, then, if that defen-dant makes default in pleading, the plaintiff may, after the expiration of the period fixed as aforesaid, for service of defence, have judgment entered against that defendant for damages to be assessed by the Court and costs, and may proceed with the action against the other defendants, if any.

5.	Default of defence: claim in detinue

Costs

A.	Security for costs

1.	Security for costs by plaintiff or defendant

(1) Where on the application of the plaintiff or defendant, as the case may be, to the Court it appears to the Court either at the commencement or at any stage of the proceedings—

(a)	that the plaintiff or defendant is ordinarily resident out of jurisdiction; or

(b)	that the plaintiff (not being a plaintiff who is suing in a representative capacity) is a nominal plaintiff who is suing for the benefit of some other person and that there is reason to believe that he will be unable to pay the costs of the defendant if ordered to do so; or

(c)	subject to sub-rule (2) of this Rule, that the plaintiffs address is not stated in the writ or other originating process or is incorrectly stated therein; or

(d)	that the plaintiff or the defendant has changed his address during the course of the proceed-ings with a view to evading the consequences of the litigation,

then if, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, the Court thinks it just to do so, it may order the plaintiff or the defendant to give such security for the plaintiffs costs or defendant’s costs of the action or other proceedings as it thinks just.

(2)	The Court shall not require a plaintiff to give security by reason only of sub-rule (1) (c) of this Rule if he satisfies the Court that the failure to state his address or the mis-statement thereof was made innocently and without intention to deceive.

(3)	The references in the foregoing rule to a plaintiff and a defendant shall be construed as references to the person (howsoever described on the record) who is in the position of plaintiff or defendant, as the case may be, in the proceeding in question, including a proceeding on a counterclaim.

7.	Principles to be observed in fixing costs

In fixing the amount of costs, the principle to be observed is that the party who is in the right is to be indemnified for the expenses to which he has been necessarily put in establishing his claim, defence or counterclaim, but the Court may take into account all the circumstances of the case.

8.	Stay of proceedings till costs paid

Where the Court orders costs to be paid or security to be given for costs by any party, the Court may, if it thinks fit, order all proceedings by or on behalf of that party in the same suit or proceedings, or connected therewith, to be stayed until the costs are paid or security given accordingly, but the order shall not supersede the use of any other lawful method of enforcing payment.

9.	Taxation of costs

When the Court deems it to be impracticable to determine summarily the amount of any costs which it has adjudged or ordered to be paid, all questions relating thereto may either be determined upon taxation by the Court itself or may be referred by the Court to a taxing master and be ascertained by him and approved by the Court.

LEGAL NOTICE ON PUBLICATION OF THE 2006 CENSUS REPORT

[S.I. No. 5 of2007.]

Whereas the National Population Commission conducted national population and housing census between 21 and 27 March, 2006, followed by a post enumeration survey in June 2006;

And whereas the National Population Commission has as required by the Constitution of Nigeria, 1999, delivered to me the report of the said population and housing Census, 2006;

And whereas the Council of State has advised me to accept the said report;

And whereas the report of the population and housing census has been laid on the table of each House of the National Assembly;

Now therefore in exercise of the power conferred upon me by virtue of section 213 (4) of the Con-stitution of Nigeria, 1999 and all other powers enabling me in that behalf, I, Olusegun Obasanjo, President, Federal Republic of Nigeria do hereby publish for information Report On Census, 2006 Provisional Results as appearing in the, Schedule to this Legal Notice.

SCHEDULE

DETAILED REPORT ON THE CENSUS, 2006 AND PROVISIONAL RESULTS

The 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria mandates the National Population Com-mission (NPC) to carry out a population census in the country and provide accurate and reliable census results. The primary objective of the census results is to assist the country in knowing as accurately and reliably as is possible within the constraints the population size, its composition and distribution. The population figures and characteristics arising out of census help the country to meet its developmental, administrative and political needs and provide inputs while planning for improving the quality of life of our countrymen. Accordingly the population and housing Census, 2006, was carried out during 21 to 27 March, 2006, followed with the post enumeration survey (PES) in June, 2006.

All the UN member nations are expected to carry out a reliable and accurate population and housing census, preferably every ten years. It is also expected that while carrying out the census exercise scientific and modem concepts are used and international standards met. The previous census was carried out in November, 1991 and therefor the Census, 2006 was conducted after a gap of fifteen years for various reasons and not ten years as mandated. Since in developing countries there is much population dynamics involved, if censuses are not carried out with regularity, vital data gap occurs not allowing the country to plan properly for its people based on sound demographic data. With carrying out the Census, 2006, this vital gap now seems to have been covered and catered for.

The Nigerian census history is replete with controversies over the population count and the earlier efforts to provide the country with accurate and reliable figures ended up most of the time in controversies leading to the cancellation of the exercise or non-acceptability of the census results, with the exception of the 1991 Census. This was mostly due to over politicisation of the census process, failure to meet the international standards and lack of transparency in the methodology and processes adopted. Varying degrees of over-enumeration of population was rampant through out the country coupled with omission of certain settlements in the earlier census exercises and this possibly contributed much to the unacceptability of the census results. To overcome these deficiencies the present Commission adopted the use of the modem and internationally accepted standards and concepts of census taking with total transparency being practised to allow both for national and international monitoring of the processes and methodologies used in Census, 2006. As per the UN guidelines it takes about thirty-six months advance preparation for any country to conduct the population and housing census. This is because it is commonly understood that census is the biggest peacetime activity in any country for mobilising men and material for a single and simultaneous operation through out the country. The preparations for this census truly began in the later half of 2004 with the international development partners, EU, UNFPA, UNDP, DFID and USAID agreeing to support the census activity of the Federal Government by providing financial and technical assistance. NPC acknowledges the total support of the Federal Government and the Developmental Partners which assisted it in conducting this census exercise. The Commission also acknowledges the support provided in this exercise at various stages by the National Assembly, state and local governments, CSGS, Faith Based Organisations, NGOs, traditional rulers and several other stakeholders. The media, both print and electronic, national and regional, need to be commended for their commitment to reach the census messages to the people of Nigeria in every nook and comer of the country however remote.

An accurate and reliable census usually implies that the coverage and content of the census are fairly satisfactory. While no census exercise any where in the world is perfect in terms of coverage or content, the critical question is the quality of the efforts and methodology used. To ensure that the entire country is covered during the census operations, the Commission embarked de novo on carrying out the enumeration area demarcation exercise to cover all settlements however small and remote and carve out enumeration areas for proper assignment of the work load to enumerators. Satellite imageries were also used where permissible. To ensure full involvement of the people, a massive public awareness campaign was launched throughout the country with special attention to rural and remote populations. This effort led to full support and participation of the people during the enumeration and it is estimated that the coverage was more than satisfactory. To estimate the coverage error, the PES was conducted as per international practice, in June, 2006 and the results from the PES when available are expected to be used for validating this assertion on area coverage.

Following the census field work, the data processing of the census data collected by the enumerators on the census form began in seven Data Processing Centres (DPCs) where the census forms collected from the field were duly archived. Modem and reliable processes of scanning and editing the census forms were used with additional safety margins built in during census form printing and designing of introducing state code on every form. This helped in ensuring that census forms of one state did not and could not be used during the field exercise or mixed up during data processing with another state. In addition any forms tom apart or that could not be scanned for any reason were examined by a special group and manually data entered. Thus total and complete integrity was attempted and maintained of the data during its processing. The transmission of the data from the Data Processing Centres to the headquarters was kept fully secured with the use of passwords.

Next stage in data processing is data extraction, concatenation, validation and moderation of the data if it does not meet the demographic patterns. Extreme care was observed during these processes and this activity was restricted to a select expert and technically competent group with close monitoring by International experts. Due cognisance was undertaken of the past history of the previous census validation efforts and critical observations made by the EU monitoring group in their report following the census. To quote from the EU monitoring report, Chapter 5 Recommendations ‘Recommendation 1: Clean the data carefully’. Again to quote from the Executive Summary of the same report, 'Conclusion 2: The accuracy of the raw data coming from the field is partly unsatisfactory and the data needs careful cleaning at the DPCs.” Cleaning and improving of data does not imply manipulating it. It means using conventional and non-conventional (country specific) demographic and statistical techniques for examining the data quality and evolving and adopting suitable methodology for this purpose. If on examination, it is observed that the quality of the data collected is not up to the mark and it is not improved upon and presented as such, the adulterated data will result in garbage in and garbage out, making a mockery of the census results technically and demographically. This obviously will lead to the unacceptability of the census results both nationally and internationally leading to a serious waste of national resources international aid while making a serious dent of the reputation and pride of the country in international and diplomatic spheres for its inability to know ‘HOW MANY ARE WE’? The methodology used therefor also factored in such instances where no or partial enumeration was reported during the census. Efforts will be made to carry out detailed and intense verification in the coming months to fully determine and adjudicate technically all such and similar cases and use of the PES will also be made to fine tune the results particularly at the lowest administrative level such as LGA and locality; This is another good reason that the current report covers the national and state population figures only.

While every effort possible has been made to ensure the integrity and credibility of the census results, it is humanly impossible to meet the expectations of all the people in the country. This is particularly so, if there is already a mind set or a pre-conceived notion of a particular population figure in somebody’s perception. During my advocacy visits to several states I had observed and noted that even several months prior to the conduct of the census important, responsible and highly placed individuals, organisations and even academicians had determined to the decimal point the population of a particular area or region. There is a feeling in some quarters that their cities or states have already reached a particular population level while others feel that they cannot loose their past demographic advantage or growth rates. Population dynamics cannot and do not remain stationary or constant over long intervals and in developing countries need to be underscored here.

Almost all these wild guesstimates apparently were based on their perception mostly out of ignorance or possibly ulterior motives to suit their agenda. Most of these assertions fail to pass the known demographic patterns and therefor need to be dealt with appropriately and immediately at the highest level if these surface again following the declaration of the census results, particularly if these statements are inflammatory and detrimental to the unity of the country and its people, ITiere it would be advisable to brief the political, social and religious leaders and individuals who command respect in the society and in exalted positions to exercise caution and discretion while commenting on census results and help in assuaging the feelings of the people. Media management therefor will be a top priority activity to attend to unreasonable and unscientific criticism of the census results. It is also proposed to convene a meeting of the Development Partners as soon as possible and if Mr President accepts the census results. This will help in making the census results acceptable internationally also.

The next phase will involve the processing, collation, validation and tabulation of the final popula-tion totals and characteristics. This will include most importantly for the first time the data on housing stock, amenities and assets available to the household. Results on fertility and mortality as also age, literacy, educational levels, migration, marital status, occupation, etc., will also be processed. The demographic, social and economic characteristics of the population will be used for better allocation of resources, as intervention instruments and for improving the overall quality of life of our countrymen. All this work along with a very powerful campaign for disseminating the data at several levels from the national to the local level has been planned for in the coming years.

MAIN FINDINGS OF CENSUS, 2006 PROVISIONAL RESULTS

1.	The total provisional population of Nigeria is 140,003,542 comprising of 71,709,859 males and 68,293,683 females (Annexure A). This translates in an annual growth rate of 3.2 per cent over the 1991 Census figures (Annexure B). It may be remembered that the provisional population totals for Census, 2006 do not take into consideration any territorial regions, which have been ceded to another country since the census taking. Also the state totals at this point of time do not take into account any inter state or international boundary disputed areas. These areas will be dealt with appropriately while finalising the census results.

2.	The sex ratio of the population is 105 and shows slight preponderance of males over females at the national level.

3.	The state population totals indicate an annual growth rate between 2.8 to 3.5 per cent (except Abuja FCT) with most of the state growth rates hovering between 2.9 to 3.3 per cent (Annexure B).

4.	The population size of the states indicates that their relative position has by and large remained stable with the first six states retaining their position as it is while most of the other states observe minor shifts (Annexures A and C).

5.	Abuja FCT area has grown at a phenomenal annual growth rate of 9.3 per cent (Annexure B). This is almost three times the national growth rate in spite of the fact that much demolition and therefor possibly forced population out migration took place just before the census. It may also be remembered that Abuja FCT population does not include the satellite towns in neighbouring states of Niger and Nasarawa.

6.	As regards regional population distribution the states comprising northern Nigeria constitute about 53.6 per cent while the states in southern Nigeria constitute about 46.4 per cent of the country’s population.

7.	The national and state provisional population totals appear to be accurate, credible and demog- raphically and technically plausible. These figures are in broad agreement with the scientifically worked out population projections and other demographic data available and therefor in my view should be accepted.

LEGAL NOTICE ON PUBLICATION OF THE DETAILS

OF THE BREAKDOWN OF THE NATIONAL AND

STATE PROVISIONAL TOTALS, 2006 CENSUS

[S.I. No. 23 of 2007.]

Whereas:

The National Population Commission conducted national population and housing census between 21 and 27 March, 2006, followed by a post enumeration survey in June, 2006;

The National Population Commission has as required by the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999, delivered to me the report of the said Population and Housing Census, 2006;

I have accepted the report on the advice of the Council of State;

The report has been laid on the table of each House of the National Assembly;

The detailed report on the Census, 2006 and provisional results was published in Federal Govern-ment’s Extraordinary Gazette, No. 4 of 19 January, 2007, Vol. 94 as Statutory Instrument No. 5;

And the National Population Commission has presented to me Details of the breakdown of the Na-tional and State Provisional Population Totals 2006 Census with the Explanatory Note;

Now therefore, in exercise of the powers conferred upon me by virtue of section 213 (4) of the Con-stitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999, and all other powers enabling me in that behalf, I, Olusegun Obasanjo, President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, do hereby publish for information Details of the Breakdown of the National and State Provisional Population Totals 2006 Census as ap-pearing in Second Schedule to this Legal Notice.

FIRST SCHEDULE

General Explanatory Note For The Breakdown of State Population Totals For 2006

Census Provisional Results

The national and state population totals were accepted by the Federal Government on 9 January, 2007. The stage is now set for providing the breakdown of the state population totals by LGA. While appreciating the 774 LGAs provisional population totals, the following important issues must be borne in mind before reaching any hasty conclusions or expressing opinions as these may not take into account various known and unknown facts and situations which may seem not to influence population dynamics.

1.	While it is possible to explain largely (though not necessarily fully) through demographic principles the changes in population size and its distribution at the country and state level this may not necessarily hold true 

at the LGA level. This is because of the huge differences in the physical areas and the population size at the LGA level. While the impact of migration of the population is likely to have a relatively small impact at the national and state level, this could be a significant factor at the LGA level in several instances. It may be recalled also that the 1991 and 2006 censuses were carried out in different months and seasons and the mobility of the population in terms of direction and quantum is unevenly distributed over the year. Thus broadly speaking LGA populations could be influenced favourably or adversely by population movements - seasonal or due to several other factors.

2.	It may again be recalled that new States and LG As were created just before the 1991 Census and also in 1996. This resulted in the increase of LGAs from 555 to 593 and then finally to 774. The apportionment of the Enumeration Areas (EAs) to reflect the newly created LGAs population may not have been perfect in all cases as the demarcation of the new boundaries of the LGAs affected was not necessarily clear in all cases when the results were finalised for 1991 Census. The Commission was dependent on other agencies while assigning EAs of 1991 Census to the newly created LGAs and changes continued to take place thereafter. The frequent boundary changes before and after the 1991 Census thus could have affected the process of population apportionment due to this and other factors.

3.	The 1991 population figures for 774 LGAs were on a stand alone basis and no comparison, validation or consistency checks against previous population totals was required or carried out as none existed. Thus if wittingly or unwittingly any errors were introduced, these cannot be rectified now with retrospective effect and will continue to affect the totals if comparisons are made or consistency checks are applied.

4.	There is a gap of over fourteen years between the 1991 and 2006 Census during which seven new States and 219 new LGAs were created. While the old names of the LGAs continue in most cases, these LGAs (bifurcated or trifurcated) now do not reflect the same area as their previous self and therefor their population size has undergone a significant change. The creation of new States and LGAs would possibly have influenced population dynamics of in and out migration, The precise nature, direction and quantum of changes in population movement is unlikely to be evenly distributed and will necessarily be consistent or in accordance with public or political perceptions. While some LGAs may even lose populations others may increase at a phenomenal pace due to various factors which may not necessarily be explained fully by known demographic principles. The reasons for churning of the population could be influenced by political, administrative, social, ethnic, religious, industrial and even international events.

5.	It may again be recalled that certain areas of the country during the 1991 Census complained/experienced an undercount of population (over count is not well recorded but it is likely to have occurred in some LGAs). If during the 2006 Census these areas (of undercount in 1991) were better covered, these are likely to experience a higher growth. Similarly areas where over count could not be repeated this time and was better controlled during 2006 Census, may experience a very low increase in population.

6.	The population size and the physical area of the .774 LGAs varies considerably in the country. Gen-erally speaking certain highly urban LGAs had a very small land area and their physical capacity to take population increase was already exhausted or extremely limited. This was particularly true if the LGAs in question had commercial/administrative/industrial features and if the land/building prices were very high. There were as many as 76 LGAs (about 10%), which had a physical area of less than 20 x 10 kms i.e. 200 kms. It may also be remembered that as per 1991 Census, there were as many as 64 LGAs (about 9%), which had a population of less than 50,000 while 21 LGAs had a population of over 300,000. While a relatively small population increase will make a huge visible impression of population growth for such small sized LGAs, to have similar impact for big size LGAs a very large population increase is required. The LGAs with small population size were Bakassi LGA in Cross River state and Eastern Obolo LGA in Akwa Ibom state.

7.	The country has witnessed during the period of the two censuses several social disturbances due to political, ethnic and religious reasons in certain areas. This has possibly resulted in population move-ments of precisely unknown quantum and direction within or even outside the LGAs and states. These movements could be short term or long term and therefor accordingly be reflected in the population of the affected LGAs. Similarly, if the ground situation improved after the 1991 Census, certain populations which had moved out of the LGAs before the 1991 Census and were enumerated in a particular LGA then would not have been enumerated in 2006 in the same LGA as before. Thus while some LGAs will now gain others will definitely suffer loss due to such population movements. It may be  

recalled that some enumerating staff deployed by the Commission for 2006 Census were killed while some were assaulted and chased away during the current census in certain parts of the country. These areas are likely to be affected.

8.	There are reportedly population movements into certain LGAs on or near the international borders due to the arising diplomatic situation with certain neighbouring countries.

9.	It is not known how the disputed areas were settled while finalising the 1991 Census results. There are no explanatory notes to this effect in official publications. The Commission is aware that disputed areas within and among states exist. Proper identification of the localities and EAs is currently under progress and when finalised will be taken into account for the final population at LGA level. For the moment barring Taraba state no such effect has been given.

10.	Possible use of the Post Enumeration Survey (PES) result on validation of the final census results is awaited. This will depend on when the PES result is available and its quality.

11.	One should always remember that the DETAILS OF THE BREAKDOWN OF THE NATIONAL AND STATE PROVISIONAL POPULATION TOTALS, 2006 CENSUS are provisional and not the final results. If there is any clerical or other bona fide error, it will be taken into account and rectified when the consistency and validation checks are performed before the final results are prepared and presented in due course.

CORRIGENDUM

12.	In case of Osun state, the population figure for the state in the last row should read as 3,423,535 instead of 3,423,536 and the female figure should read as 1,682,916 instead of 1,682,917 published in Federal Government's Extraordinary Gazette, No. 4 of 19th January, 2007, Vol. 94 as Statutory Instrument, No. 5.

REPORT ON THE CENSUS, 2006, FINAL RESULTS

It is with great pleasure that I submit for Your Excellency’s consideration and approval, the report on the Census, 2006, final results. In the extraordinary meeting of the National Population Commission held today, 24th September, 2008, the Commission deliberated on the final population totals for the country, every state and Local Government Area and approved the results at its level, which are submitted herewith. This report is in pursuance of the two earlier reports submitted vide my letters reference nos. NPC/10/S-48/XVLIII/23 8 dated 29 December, 2006 and NPC/10/S-48/XIV/29 dated 11 April, 2007, respectively.

The total population (both sexes) of Nigeria is 140,431,790 (one hundred forty million, four hundred thirty one thousand, seven hundred ninety) comprising of 71,345,488 (seventy one million, three hundred forty-five thousand, four hundred and eighty eight) males and 69,086,302 (sixty nine million, eighty-six thousand, three hundred and two) females. The absolute change in the population of the country is 428,248 (four hundred twenty eight thousand, two hundred and forty-eight) and the percentage change is an increase of 0.3 per cent (point three per cent) over the provisional results. There has been no change in the relative ranking of any of the states from the approved provisional population results.

ANNEXUREA

REPORT ON THE 2006 CENSUS FINAL RESULTS

1.	This report records the salient features of the many efforts made and several steps undertaken by the National Population Commission which led to the conceptualisation, government approval, in-ternational support and actual conduct of the Population and Housing Census, 2006, in a democratic set up after a long interval. The report should be read in conjunction with the earlier explanatory notes, which form a part of the earlier census reports to the President by the Commission and were gazetted in January, 2007 and May, 2007 respectively (Extraordinary Federal Republic of Nigeria Official Gazette, No. 4, Lagos 19th January, 2007, Vol. 94 and Extraordinary Federal Republic of Nigeria Official Gazette, No. 24, Lagos 15 May, 2007, Vol. 94).

2.	It is expected that this report should facilitate considerably all census stakeholders in the country and outside, to appreciate the enormous complexities and risks involved in undertaking a population census, considered usually as the single biggest peace time activity operations in moving men and material in any country, but more so in Nigeria where it no longer remains a purely administrative and statistical exercise. The political undertones and ethno-religious bonds still form, influence and attempt to distort considerably the process of population enumeration. This report will also provide a glimpse of the special ‘Nigerian factors’ which have affected the past censuses and some of which continue to haunt this one as well. Arguably therefor conducting a population census and making some sense out of the processed data in our country is not a straight forward job as described in the standard text books or experienced in most countries the world over. The perils are far too many at every step but every conceivable effort has been made by the Commission to keep the census on track and to overcome these within the constraints of the prevailing working environment, the social and political milieu of the country and provide with as credible a census, with minimum errors, as is humanly possible, challenges undermining it notwithstanding.

3.	It requires political courage and conviction by the government of the day in our country to an-nounce its intention of conducting a census, supporting it and their accepting its results. The exer-cise is full of land mines and has the potential of destabilising the government and the country, if enough care is not taken to make it worthy of acceptance nationally and internationally. One wrong step during the preparations or conduct of the census or when the results are announced could explode in the face and heads in the government or of the government could roll on the ground in a split second. These risks and sensitivity need to be very much appreciated in the Nigerian context in comparison to how censuses are conducted and the results accepted without a whimper in other countries. The challenge is to control politicisation and manipulation of the census exercise at all costs and at every step by the agency responsible for conducting it. While it may look to the naive that an exercise such as holding of elections has a greater political risk, the fact that population figures arising from census are the core basis of revenue allocation and electoral representations, the subtle Nigerian mind understands that once the census results are accepted nothing can be undone until the next census, which could be several years apart (the last census was fifteen years earlier, (2006 - 1991), and the preceding one twenty-eight years earlier (1991- 1963)). In a democratic set up, elections will be held every, four years but the uncertainty of the next census looms large irrespective whether there is a civilian or a military dispensation.

Historical Background of Censuses in Independent Nigeria

4.	The history of census taking in independent Nigeria has been riddled with controversies. Censuses in pre-independence colonial Nigeria were neither conducted synchronously nor as per the modem principles of population enumeration. The first census in independent Nigeria was conducted in 1962, but had to be cancelled after declaration of the results, as it did not meet the ‘expectations’ of the political elite. Another census was conducted in 1963, which was ultimately accepted politically with much rancour but technically the results were not defensible as these have been often termed as ‘negotiated’. However, in absence of any other reliable population figures for several years, the results of the 1963 census formed the basis of planning and political governance. Another census was attempted in 1973 by the then military regime but after conducting the census, the results were declared annulled by the then government.

5.	No census could be conducted in the 1980’s and in 1991 the then military government conducted a census. The provisional results were declared in 1992 but the final results could be accepted by the government only in October, 1997. Although not everyone either in the country or outside accepted the census results of 1991, over the years by and large there was general consensus that the 1991 results were a fair representation of the national and regional populations. With the installation of a democratic government in 1999, attempts were made to hold a census at the beginning of the new century but these efforts could not materialise. With the return of the same democratically elected government in 2003, more efforts at the governmental level were made to conduct a census now, which finally culminated in holding it in March, 2006. Thus it is clear that our country has a long way to go and establish a tradition of conducting periodical censuses every ten years and allow it to be an administrative and technical exercise devoid of politics of numbers, region or ethnicity. The overall acceptability of the census therefor should be viewed by all stakeholders in light of these historical facts with a view to strengthen the process of conducting census regularly and at definite intervals.

Constitutional Responsibility for Conducting and Procedure for Accepting Census Results

6.	Let us understand and appreciate the current process and steps involved in conducting and accep-tance of the census results as laid down in the Constitution and the potential risks involved. The 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria mandates the National Population Commission with the responsibility of conducting the population census in the country. The Chairman of the Commission and thirty-seven Federal Commissioners each representing a State and the FCT are appointed by the President (subject to the confirmation of the Senate) and form the body of the Commission. In addition, as regards the appointment of the Chairman of the Commission, the President is mandated to consult the Council of State. Thus each state is equally represented and their interests are duly taken care of, so as to avoid charges of manipulation of census results against any state or by any state. It is because of this arrangement of having a Federal Commis-sioner representing the interest of every state in the union that it is inconceivable and practically impossible to allow manipulation of the census results in favour of or against any state. The Direc-tor-General of the Commission, who is the accounting officer and the technical head of the man-agement, is an ex-officio member of the Commission. Under Section 158 (2) of the Constitution, the Commission is not subjected to any direction or control of any authority or person in carrying out the operation of conducting the census or in compiling its report of the national census. Thus while much autonomy has been granted in law to the Commission in conducting its affairs with regard to the census, administering it in reality is a very challenging, painstaking and conscientious task.

7.	The census results are first examined by the Commission and after due deliberations may be ac-cepted by it. Under section 213, the Chairman of the Commission presents and delivers the report of the population census to the President. The President, if he is satisfied with the census results, within thirty days shall lay the report before the Council of State, which shall consider it and advice him whether to accept or reject it. Further, when the Council of State advises the President to accept the report, the President is mandated to accept the report and also lay it on the table of each House of the National Assembly. In a scenario where the President has accepted the report and has also laid it on the table of both the chambers of the National Assembly, the report shall be published in the Official Gazette for public information. If, however, the Council of State advises the 

President to reject the report on the grounds that the population results are inaccurate or the report is perverse, the report shall be so rejected by the President and no reliance shall be placed upon any such report by any authority or person for any purpose whatsoever. The consequence of the rejection of the census report is draconian and under section 157 (3), ‘All members of the National Population Commission shall cease to be members if the President declares a National Census Report as unreliable and the report is rejected in accordance with section 213 of this Constitution.’

Stages in Conducting Population and Homing Census

8.	The constitution of Nigeria mandates the National Population Commission (NPOPC) to carry out a population census in the country and provide an accurate and reliable census result. The primary objective of the census results is to assist the country in knowing as accurately and reliably as is possible within the constraints the population size, its composition and distribution. The population figures and characteristics arising out of census help the country to meet its developmental, administrative and political needs and provide inputs while planning for improving the quality of life of our countrymen. Accordingly the population and housing Census, 2006 was carried out during 21 to 25 March, 2006 and extended by two days to facilitate enumeration of population on a de-facto basis. It was followed by the Post Enumeration Survey (PES) in June, 2006.

9.	All the UN member nations are expected to carry out a reliable and accurate population and housing census preferably every ten years. It is also expected that while carrying out the census exercise scientific and modem concepts are used and international standards met. The previous census was carried out in November, 1991 and therefor the Census, 2006 was conducted after a gap of about fifteen years for various reasons and not ten years as is the norm. Since in developing countries there is much population dynamics involved, if censuses are not carried out with regularity, a vital data gap occurs not allowing the country to plan properly for its people based on sound demographic data. With carrying out the Census, 2006, this vital gap now seems to have been cov-ered and catered for.

10.	The Nigerian census history is replete with controversies over the population count and the earlier efforts to provide the country with accurate and reliable figures ended up most of the time in con-troversies leading to the cancellation of the exercise or non-acceptability of the census results, with the exception of the 1991 Census. This was mostly due to over-politicisation of the census process, failure to meet the international standards and lack of transparency in the methodology and processes adopted. Varying degrees of over-enumeration of population was rampant through out the country coupled with omission of certain settlements in the earlier census exercise and this coupled with the failure to technically control it, possibly contributed much to the unacceptability of the census results. To improve on these and other deficiencies the present Commission adopted the use of the internationally accepted standards and concepts of census taking with total transparency being practiced to allow both for national and international monitoring of the processes and methodologies used in Census, 2006.

11.	As per the UN guidelines, it takes about thirty-six months advance preparation for any country to conduct the population and housing census of the country. This is because it is commonly under-stood that census is the biggest peacetime activity in any country for mobilising men and material for a single and simultaneous operation through out the country. It was decided to initially hold the census in 2001, but Nigeria had to miss the 2000 round of global census for various reasons. With the same democratic government returning to power in 2003, it was decided to hold the census in November-December, 2005. The preparations for this census truly began in the later half of 2004 with the international development partners (EU, UNFPA, UNDP, DFID and USAID) agreeing to support the census activity of the Federal Government by providing financial and technical assistance.

12.	The basis for conducting a census rests on creating a sound census frame to ensure as complete coverage as is possible of all settlements in the country. This process is the stepping stone in initi-ating the census field work and it is usually expected that certain continuity will be maintained from the previous census and should be consistent with the local administrative structure. Listing of all localities and creation of appropriate Enumeration Areas (EAs) so as to permit the pair of enumerators (an enumeration team consisted usually of two enumerators, one male and the other female) to complete enumeration of the area(s) assigned to them forms the basis of the Enumeration Area Demarcation (EAD) exercise. A completely de-novo delineation of EAs began for the 2006 Census without any linkage or continuity with the 1991 Census in three phases. In the first phase, commencing in mid 2004, seven LGAs were selected for this exercise, one local government area in each of the six geo-political zones and FCT Abuja. In the second phase of EAD exercise, beginning in November, 2004, thirty-seven LGAs, one from each state and FCT Abuja were selected. And finally in early 2005, the EAD exercise was launched throughout the country in all the states. It was expected that this phase will be completed by June, 2006, leaving enough time for establishing the complete census frame, before the scheduled enumeration in November- December, 2005. Satellite imageries were also procured with assistance of DFID, UK to assist in EAD exercise,

13.	The third phase of EAD exercise which began in earnest, however, ran into problems of timely financial support. The Commission had to fall back on the support of the state governments and in some cases even local governments assisted the EAD exercise financially and in kind. Eventually this slowed down the pace of the delineation considerably and monitoring and supervision also suffered and influenced the large number of undersized EAs ultimately created than what was ex-pected. This was abetted also by an unfortunate perception in the field that greater the number of EAs, however unequal their size may be, greater will be the population enumerated ultimately. This situation ultimately led to a large number of EAs delineated and also led to deviation from the standard size EAs in many cases throughout the country. However the situation was appropriately controlled before the enumeration took place so that the workload of the enumerator remained equitable as far as possible taking into account certain factors.

14.	In 2003, the Commission constituted a Census Technical Working Group (CTWG), under the Di-rector-General of the Commission and comprising of all the technical Directors from the divisions (Director Census, Director Cartography, Director Planning and Research, Director Information Technology, Director Vital Registration and Director Public Affairs), and senior and experienced census and survey technical staff from all divisions and even from the state offices. The mandate to the CTWG was to discuss all the census procedures and processes as per the international guidelines, customising them to the Nigerian environment, and examine all the technical issues re-lated to every stage of the census from conceptualising to its full execution and implementation. The objective was to provide the country with a transparent, credible and accurate census as was possible. This was the highest technical body to advise the Commission on all technical aspects and phases of census. The principle of continuing with the de facto methodology of enumeration as adopted in 1991 Census was recommended and finally accepted by the Commission. The total of all usual residents is generally referred as the de facto population and the total of all persons present and enumerated as the de facto population. This principle of enumerating persons present, seen and making themselves available for enumeration when the enumerator visited their households formed the core basis for conducting the census.

15.	As the principal instrument for conducting census it was felt necessary by the Commission to hold a national consultation on the methodology of conducting the census and inclusion of population and housing variables in this national endeavour. Accordingly a national workshop was held in September, 2004, in Kaduna where the principal stakeholders from across the country including Federal Ministries, National Bureau of Statistics, State governments, CSGs, FBOs, Pressure Groups, Academicians, Demographers, Social Scientists and Development Partners were invited.

At the end of the workshop the census methodology and a draft set of census questionnaire was adopted. The contentious, sensitive and political issue of inclusion of the questions on religion and, ethnicity was left for the Federal Government to decide. Taking into account the overall situation and past history of the (mis)interpretations of the population composition by ethnicity and religious group and its potential to divide the country and prevent from conducting or accepting the census results, it was decided that for the 2006 census these two variables should not be included.

Raising Public Awareness and Public Participation

16.	To involve all segments of the Nigerian population in conducting the census, the Chairman and all the Federal Commissioners undertook extensive and exhaustive advocacy tours to each of the thirty*-six states and FCT and Local Government Councils there in. They met the Executive Gov-ernors or their representatives, Chairmen of Local Governments, Traditional Rulers, Faith Based Organisations (FBOs), Civil Society Groups (CSGs) and NGOs in addition to the members of the public and local media. To muster the support of the mobile nomadic population for their proper enumeration, the Commission made extra efforts in not only seeking the involvement and partner-ship of the National Nomadic Education Commission, Kaduna, but also of the state based other nomadic organisations and community leaders all over the country. To improve rural awareness, special market rallies on census themes were organised by the Commission across the country in addition to approaching the people through the network of national and regional radio, television and newspaper in local languages. Special sensitisation workshops on ‘Census Awareness’ for the media houses were organised by the Commission with the assistance of UNFPA on more than one occasion in various parts of the country. Six regional workshops in each of the six geo-political zones were organised before the census to involve the various CSGs/NGOs and FBOs in monitoring of the census. These organisations were also provided with accredited identity cards from the Commission to visit any part of the country to monitor the census training and enumeration process. These advocacy measures were taken in addition to the usual campaign strategies on electronic and print media of the television, radio and newspaper in all regional/local languages. The principle of de facto census, that is only those present will be enumerated, was emphasised time and again in these campaigns.

National and International Monitoring

17.	It is important to note that the EU constituted a five member independent ‘Monitoring Mission’ since December, 2004, to report to it and other Development Partners regularly, on the various aspects of the preparations undertaken by the Commission and whether international standards as laid down by the UN were being followed scrupulously or not. Any short comings noticed by the census experts of the Monitoring Team were brought to the attention of the Commission and were promptly attended to and rectified. To improve transparency, most of the information on various census aspects was hosted on the Commission’s website for public display and scrutiny and comments if any. As a part of monitoring of EU assisted projects in the country, special monitors were sent by EU to report to it on the census project also every year since 2005 and another mission is underway as this report is being finalised.

18.	As an important element of bringing transparency and credibility and with a view to have an unbi-ased monitoring, for the training and enumeration process, eighty-eight international monitors (census experts), were recruited by the EU from twenty-three countries. The country wide moni-toring began on 3 March and ended on 12 May, 2006. It covered census training for census enu-merators and supervisors, conduct of the population enumeration, retrieval of the census forms from the field and payment of the allowances to the census field functionaries. The monitoring efforts were facilitated by the Commission for these eighty-eight International Experts, in addition to the national monitors.

19.	The EU Monitoring Mission’s report on conduct of the 2006 Census was submitted to EU in May, 2006. This report adjudicated the census processes as transparent and credible and meeting the in-ternational standards with some advisory on cleaning up the data collected during the census. To quote from the EU REPORT, ‘The Monitors observed that the people were trained and worked as enumerators have shown great dedication to their jobs. Also the general public has generally been very positive towards the Census and has provided hospitality to the enumerators who often had to work in difficult circumstances and ‘Overall the EU monitors consider that the Nigerian people, and all organisations who made positive contributions to the preparation and execution of this phase of the Census, can congratulate themselves on 'a job well done”.’

20.	The Commission knowing the past history of the allegations of politicisation of the census process and manipulation of results, adopted an open door and transparent policy of sharing all possible information at every stage of the census preparations, enumeration and data processing. The EU monitoring team had access to all departmental heads in the Commission. In addition the Com-mission held regular and open meetings from time-to-time with the Development Partners and up-dated them on the current status of census activities. A special visit of the media houses was or-ganised by the Commission in the month of August, 2006 for the media to understand the huge work of data processing and the complexities involved. This helped them to appreciate better the arrangements and procedure for data processing deployed by the Commission at the seven regional Data Processing Centres (DPCs) including the security measures undertaken. In addition five EU consultants were posted at the DPCs to ensure that the neutrality aspects and quality assurance standards required are being observed while data processing was in progress and until its completion. There were two open and televised live sessions across the country, ‘Presidential Stakeholders Forum on 2006 Census on 15 March, 2006, one week prior to the Census and again on 5 October, 2006, when the data processing was underway. Stakeholders from all walks of life, including the Development Partners, attended this forum where the Chairman made presentations on the current state of Census. The question and answer session lasted for over two hours on each of these two occasions and every sundry query on census preparations or data processing were re-sponded to on the spot, leaving no lingering doubt in any body’s mind. This was transparency, of the entire census process, demonstrated at its best twice in full public view and publicly scrutinised, adding much creditworthiness to the census process and it is very much doubted if this can be repealed or rivalled by any organisation in the country or outside.

International Support

21.	International assistance for census came in the form of advocacy, technical back stopping, and financial aid. UNFPA helped the Commission in getting commitment from all the Development Partners in the country to assist in conducting the census. The principal agencies which assisted in conduct of the census financially, technically or administratively are the EU, UNDP, UNFPA, DFID and USAID. About forty-eight per cent of the cost of the census was borne by the Development Partners, most of it by EU alone. UNDP gave total support in disbursement of the allowances to census functionaries, DFID provided satellite imageries and other technical support while UNFPA assisted in providing technical back stopping and in advocacy measures.

22.	It may not be out of place to mention that not a single Kobo of the international financial aid for census taking came into the coffers of the Commission. The payment of allowances to the census functionaries, which accounted for approximately seventy per cent of the total EU budget, was handled directly by the UNDP who did an admirable job. The payments for printing and supply of census forms and for the hardware and software for data processing were handled directly by the EU with the participation and approval of the National Planning Commission. 

23.	The Commission was assisted in technical matters both by the UNFPA and the EU. An interim Chief Technical Adviser (CTA) on census was engaged by UNFPA who provided services mostly in the second half of 2004 until March, 2005. He undertook three missions and assisted the Commission on various aspects of census preparations and technicalities. Another very experienced census expert was appointed by UNFPA and a short mission was undertaken by him in November, 2004. He assessed the existing status of the census preparations and advised the Commission to undertake specific steps. Finally UNFPA provided the services of an International Consultant on Census, as a full time CTA from end of May, 2005, to provide necessary technical backstopping to the Commission on various aspects of census, Two IT experts on setting up the Data Processing Centres and help in various aspects of data processing were recruited by EU as full time IT and Data Processing Advisers since the beginning of 2005 and continued to provide all the necessary support to the Data Processing Centres and headquarters. The services of the former CTA and Data Processing Adviser for the 1991 Census were availed through the support from UNFPA since September, 2006. He undertook four missions until July, 2008. The services of an expert on census advocacy and public awareness measures were made available by EU to the Commission from early 2005. The expert continued to support the census operation until October, 2006. A fulltime Cartography Consultant was recruited by EU and oversaw the Cartography and Enumeration Area Demarcation work since February, 2005 until July, 2006. Prior to the engagement of the EU expert, a very experienced Cartographer on African Censuses, from UNFPA, provided technical back-stopping in the early stages of Enumeration Area Demarcation and Census Frame during the period 2003-04. The same expert also participated as regular member of the EU Monitoring mission since last quarter of 2004 until May, 2006. The specialised services of two very experienced International Census Consultants cum Demographers were availed for conducting the Post Enumeration Survey.

Policies and Measures of Neutrality Adopted by the Commission

24.	The Commission adopted a policy of cross posting of the Federal Commissioners from north to south and vice versa, about three months prior to the commencement of the census. No State Di-rector was posted in his/her state of origin. Census Supervisors numbering over seventy thousand, who directly supervised the work of the enumerators were also cross posted or worked in a State other than their state of origin. During the process of recruitment of census functionaries, the rep-resentatives of Development Partners were on the selection committees to ensure free and fair se-lection. In addition to the Development Partners, any EU member country. Embassy or High Commission who wished to observe the Trial or Main Census enumeration were permitted by the Commission to do so.

25.	Thus from the foregoing it is clear that the Commission undertook every possible step to make the entire range of census process stand the test of public scrutiny time and again and to make it as transparent, credible and acceptable as was possible. The fact that it was done in a democratic regime makes this census still more creditable and trustworthy and there is no doubt that these efforts have helped the present Commission in breaking away from the jinx of the past controversies. It is never easy to make people believe that some things can be done conscientiously if there is dedication, honesty of purpose and the will to do it. This is because the past experience of the people has been different and it takes a Herculean effort not only to break away from the past inglorious history of census taking but a greater effort is required to make people realise that it can be and has been done now. The Commission has done its bit and shall continue to do so in the future to strengthen the roots of democracy and good governance in the country. It needs to be remembered that the 2006 Census Project was the single largest funded project by the EU in Nigeria and its success aids, abets and contributes positively to the efforts of the country to get itself good governance, reduce poverty and meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

Data Processing

26.	The huge work load and the challenges involved in data processing of the census questionnaire needs to be appreciated. Following the completion of the Held work of enumeration of the popula-tion end of March, 2006, Census forms canvassed were collected back from the enumerators at the LGA and state headquarters and were sent to the seven Data Processing Centres (DPCs). The seven DPCs are located at Lagos, Ibadan, Port Harcourt, Enugu, Kaduna, Kano and Yola and the census forms of the adjoining states based on geo-political proximity were processed in each DPC, beginning from April, 2006. This policy of processing the census forms, as far as possible in the same geo-political zone, was consciously adopted by the Commission to avoid any misunder-standing or trading of charges to manipulate the population figures for any administrative unit by any section of the stakeholders. To ensure that there is transparency and neutrality during the en-tire processing, the Data Processing Manager, technical officer in charge of DPC, responsible for data processing was from a different zone. The data processing staff in the DPC had representation from the constituent states for which the data was being processed in that DPC. The Federal Commissioners in-charge of the DPC were cross-posted from south to north and north to south. The IT Department from the headquarters supervised the entire archiving and scanning operations. Finally there were six resident international monitors at the DPCs, supported by the EU/UNFPA who supervised the full data processing, in addition to the two full-time international IT Advisers for technical backstopping. To ensure that the census forms and processed data were properly secured, both the physical and electronic security systems were put in place. Security personnel were placed round the clock at the entrance of all the DPCs and the entry was restricted to only authorised persons. The data processed at the DPCs was electronically encrypted before being finally processed.

Procedure Adopted by the National Population Commission for Acceptance of the Census Results

27.	It is important to note that for the acceptance of 2006 Census results every step as conceived in the law was followed meticulously in spirit and letter. The provisional results at national and state level for the 2006 Census were deliberated by the Commission, the body of thirty-eight Commissioners, on 29 December, 2006 and unanimously accepted. The Chairman delivered the census report to Mr. President at the State House, the same day, when all the Federal Commissioners and key officers of the Commission were present. In addition, the President had invited members of the Federal Executive Council, the Development Partners and the media for this occasion. The President directed the Chairman to announce to the world the provisional total population of the country. It is important to note that all these steps and proactive measures were undertaken to improve the transparency, credibility and accountability of the 2006 Census.

28.	The President having satisfied himself with the census report presented to him, convened a meeting of the Council of State on 9 January, 2007, to advise him whether to accept or reject the said report. The Chairman along with three key officials were present for this extraordinary and historic meeting and were witnesses to its proceedings. The Council of State unanimously advised the President to accept the 2006 Census provisional results and it was accordingly accepted by the President. There was not a single dissenting voice to oppose the acceptance of the census results, a singular phenomenon in a democratic set up and speaks volumes for itself about the manner in which the Commission conducted the affairs of census taking. It is important to note that the former Presidents and Heads of Government, former Chief Justices, President of the Senate, Speaker of the House of the Representatives, Governors and Attorney General of the Federation, who constitute the Council of State, were present for this meeting and gave their unanimous nod and assent for acceptance of the 2006 Census provisional results. In accordance with the constitutional provisions, copies of the census report were laid down before each of the Houses of the National Assembly by the President and the contents officially gazetted on 19 January, 2007. Thus every aspect of the constitutional provisions was followed to the core and all legal aspects duly complied with, in addition to the tremendous amount of transparency, credibility and accountability measures taken to ensure a wide acceptability of the census results within and outside Nigeria. The Commission (the body of thirty-eight Commissioners), the Federal Government and majority of the national and international stakeholders have accepted the 2006 Census provisional results not only because the results captured and exhibited a fair representation of the national, regional and state population size and distribution but also due to the transparent and credible publicly scrutinised measures adopted during the preparation, conduct and data processing of the census. It may be noted that the provisional results providing a further breakdown of the national and state results up to the Local Government Area (LGA) level were accepted by the President on 21 April and officially gazetted on 15 May, 2007.

Final Population Results

29.	After the provisional results were accepted by the Federal Government, while most representations received by the Commission commended it for successfully conducting the census, some have pointed out certain areas of concern as these affect them at the locality, LGA or state level. These petitions were examined administratively and due cognisance taken of in appropriate cases of any inadvertent and bona fide clerical, processing or technical error including reportedly uncovered areas pointed out or discovered by the Commission itself. For example, a mix up of the codes and phonetically similar names of LGAs Kaura and Kauru in Kaduna state led to substitution of their respective populations during the release of the provisional population totals and has now been rectified. All possible attempts have been made to provide workable solutions to the above by the Commission before finalising the results to the best of its ability in the prevailing circumstances and are appropriately addressed and reflected in the final results to facilitate the overall acceptability of the census results. The provisional results helped in assessing and resolving broadly the issue of ‘How many are we?’ The final population results therefor will go beyond the numbers and provide data in stages on the characteristics of the population and the conditions in which they live. Along with the final population totals by sex, some important population and housing characteristics are therefor being compiled. These will be duly presented as basic priority tables. The full volume of the tables when produced is considerable, given the number of population and housing variables canvassed during the census and it requires a great amount of painstaking effort, labour, skill and patience to examine these for consistency and validation. This will be done progressively.

30.	The deviation between the final and provisional population totals at the national, state and local government level is well within the acceptable demographic norms and absolute or percentage population difference is not significant. The relative rankings of the states do not exhibit any change though some states have gained nominally while others show very small overall decline. Since the local governments are of vastly differing population sizes, it is natural to experience relatively greater population fluctuations at this level. It is not possible to have exactly the same provisional and final population totals due to various technical reasons involved in data processing and its collation. An accurate and reliable census usually implies that the coverage and content of the census are fairly satisfactory in the given context and it evolves gradually for every country over a course of time and not instantaneously. No census exercise anywhere in the world is perfect in terms of coverage and content and the Commission is well aware that there is always a room for improvement while attempting concurrently to address these issues statistically. It is reiterated that Census, 2006 was a de facto census and that only those seen and found during the visit(s) of the enumerators were enumerated.

31.	It is important to recall that since the last census, there were significant administrative changes in the number of states and more so in the creation of new local governments. The creation of new  

states and LGAs would have influenced the population dynamics of in and out migration of varying degrees. By way of illustration, the impact due to the effective ‘physical relocation’ of the country’s capital to the centre of the country will be of a different magnitude than possibly establishing a new State capital. The precise nature, direction and quantum of changes in population movements not being uniform, are unlikely to be evenly distributed across states and the local governments within a state. This will therefor result in uneven growth rates contrary to or not consistent with or in accordance with political or public perceptions. There are many people who regale themselves in making population estimates (guesstimates or eye estimates) of a given area mostly to suit their own arguments, political or otherwise. If there was such an instantaneous population measuring instrument available, then there would be no need of any census taking and population estimates could be made for any place and in any point in time any where on this earth.

32.	The physical area of the seven hundred and seventy-four LGAs varies considerably, with the urban LGAs usually having relatively small areas and at times giving an erroneous impression of being crowded and having too many people. It is usually translated and misinterpreted into a very high and largely unrealistic population for the area in question. The consequences of mixing up wrongly the phenomenon of high population density (number of persons per square kilometre) according to this mind set leads them to falsely believe that it should necessarily result and translate in every case, a very high population size. This is compounded by the fact that due to commercial activities, markets or public utility activities (such as educational institutions, hospitals and public or private offices for example), the day time and week day population could be significantly different than the usual resident population eligible for enumeration on a de facto basis. Large cities and towns and their administrative and commercial areas are therefor usually prone to such boastings and (mis)interpretations and this may not occur unless these cities have large open and purely peripheral residential areas within their boundary limits. Thus in many cases the capacity of the area (city) to take endlessly additional population could be easily restricted due to the physical area and its changing use from residential to commercial or public utility purposes over a period of time. Technically speaking this could result into very low growth or even declines in population for an area.

33.	The rate of population growth witnessed will not be the same even if the natural population growth rate was the same for all local government areas (which is definitely not the case due to considerable differences in mortality and fertility rates, nuptial patterns, contraceptive use, educational levels and other factors). Differential level of over count, the variance in effect of census migration phenomenon peculiar to our censuses, and uncertainties of local and state government boundaries in certain cases in the two censuses need to be factored in while making an attempt to understand the population dynamics. In addition it is important to note that the country has witnessed during the intervening period of the two censuses, several disturbances due to political, social, ethnic and religious reasons in many areas. These have led to short term and or long term population migration and redistribution within and across states but it is very challenging to measure the quantum of population affected accurately, as some LGAs or their parts would have gained while others may have lost populations since the 1991 Census. This is the ground reality but it is not easily accepted by most. There is the stereotype thinking among several states and local governments that they are immune to out migration and only receive the in migrants. It may be recalled that some enumerating staff deployed by the Commission were killed while others were assaulted and chased away during the current census enumeration in certain parts of the country. In addition there would be an impact due to closure of certain industries and commercial ventures in one state or LGA and of establishment of new ones in new areas. An additional feature of population dynamics is the period of enumeration which was November-December in 1991 but was the month of March in 2006. Thus there could be an additional impact due to differential impact of seasonal migration and movement of population within and across states and even through international borders.

34.	Taking into account all these factors, it will be prudent for all concerned but more so for the political elite, the traditional rulers, the religious leaders and the academicians to cautiously and patiently interpret the census results and air their considered opinion for public consumption with considerable degree of restraint as it befits their position in the society. That the country’s interest and its unity and integrity are paramount over regional, ethnic or local interests need not be reiter-ated to such a formidable and experienced section of the opinion forming leaders. The Commission expects a mature assessment and scientific analysis of the 2006 Census rather than emotional and sentimental expressions and outbursts with wild population guesstimates sprinkled in between. Any valid and sound criticism(s) which lead to improvements in census taking and making it apolitical, will certainly be warmly welcomed and duly acknowledged by the Commission. This is because of the inherent merits of logical and rationale analysis rising above any parochial interest and in the long run establishing the principles of census taking as being a purely administrative and statistical exercise devoid of the political undertones it has suffered for so long in our country.

35.	The data dissemination policy has been fine tuned and plans are ready to facilitate optimum use of this wealth of data for national and local planning and monitoring of various targets and policies enshrined and articulated by the Federal and state governments. It is also expected that these data sets will assist the governments at all levels to allocate and appropriate scarce and competing financial and other resources more gainfully and judiciously based on facts rather than on presumptions.

36.	While it is desirable to produce small area population data, it appears that it may take more time than expected due to the challenges involved. Locality lists provided or available, truly lack stan-dardisation and legal as well as administrative authority to be used for census purposes. Localities could mean settlements of various types and population sizes, permanent, temporary or seasonal, villages, traditional councils and autonomous communities, cutting across one or several LGAs fully or partially, depending on the context in which these are being referred to such as for planning or electoral or administrative purposes. On examination of the information collected and collated from various sources before and after the census, it appears that such a list of localities is yet to be established unambiguously. This is partly due to historical reasons of traditional and social administrative hierarchies practiced and still in vogue, wide differences in settlement patterns and their nomenclature in different parts of the country, absence of clearly defined boundaries, differ-ences in perception of what constitutes rural and urban settlements, etc. An attempt by the National Population Commission to identify, list and classify localities before and during the commencement of the EAD exercise in consultation with the Chairmen of all the local governments over a period of three years could not resolve this issue satisfactorily.

37.	As a result, the Commission brought this to the notice of the President and requested for setting up in August, 2007 an Inter-Agency Ad-Hoc Committee on Compendium of Localities for Nigeria to resolve this national issue. The President accordingly approved this request of the Commission and directed the Secretary to the Government of Federation (SGF) to constitute such a group in September, 2007. An Inter-ministerial Committee from the following agencies - National Space Research Development Agency (NASRDA), National Boundary Commission (NBC), Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC), National Population Commission (NPOPC), Office of the Surveyor General of the Federation (OSGOF), and Office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (OSGF) was duly constituted. This committee also requested the Association of Local Governments of Nigeria (ALGON), Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and Nigeria Postal Services (NIPOST) as the principal data users of locality list, to assist it in resolving this contentious issue. The Committee, through the National Population Commission, submitted its interim report in December, 2007, to the President. One of its important findings clearly brought out the fact that various agencies were using different locality list for the same LGA, none of which appeared to be updated, complete or unambiguous by itself, with the locality list in possession of the National Population Commission possibly the most comprehensive among all the agencies. It also recommended that it was desirable to establish a national list of all localities in the country as an essential tool for good governance and the Federal Government should fund the working of this Inter-Agency Committee on the Compendium of List of Localities for Nigeria. An approval from the Federal Government on the implementation of recommendations of this report is being awaited by the Commission to enable it to use it for census purposes. Therefor the work relating to small area population data will be undertaken progressively by the Commission.

38.	Another issue that could not be fully resolved by the Commission was about acceptable resolutions of the many disputed areas which surfaced during the demarcation and or enumeration exercise. The disputed areas are between a State and another neighbouring country, between two or more states, between LGAs within a State and between two localities or communities within the LGA. Every attempt was made to demarcate such designated ‘disputed areas’, some how or the other and enumerate and account for them appropriately in the results. For example, the disputed areas relating to Ussa and Ta- kum LGAs in Taraba state were indicated separately dining the provisional results while that between LGAs Adavi and Okchi in Kogi state have now been accounted for in the final results. It became apparent that the best the Commission could attempt was to demarcate and enumerate these disputed areas to complete the census exercise and account for them suitably but leave their legal adjudication to the appropriate authorities. This is because of the very contentious and volatile nature of the disputes and the disputing parties and possibility of the accusation of a biased solution by the Commission from the contending parties. Several of these disputes have been in existence for generations and have taken hundreds of innocent lives. These disputes as and when appropriately resolved and adjudicated through legal or other measures can be taken note of again by the Commission and necessary rectification made in appropriate cases.

39.	The Commission would once again like to place on record its deep gratitude and sense of appre-ciation to all the stakeholders within and outside government in every part of Nigeria and those living abroad who contributed immensely in making this census happen at every stage. The fruits of this national effort are meant for the benefit of every one of our countrymen and women to facilitate good governance, strengthen democracy, assist in reduction of poverty and provide meaningful data for uplifting the lives of fellow Nigerians.
