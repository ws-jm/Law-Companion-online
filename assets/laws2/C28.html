Special Exceptions in Respect of a Sound Recording of a Musical Work

1.	The copyright in a musical work is not infringed by a person (in this Schedule referred to as 'the record producer”) who makes a recording of the work or of an adaptation thereof in Nigeria, if—

(a)	records of the work, or as the case may be, of a similar adaptation of the work, have previ-ously been made in, or imported into Nigeria for the purposes or retail sale, and were so made or imported by, or with the licence of, the owner of the copyright in the work;

(b)	before making the recording, the record producer gave to the owner of the copyright the prescribed notice of his intention to make it;

(c)	the record producer intends to sell the record by retail, or to supply if for the purpose of its being sold by retail by another person, or intends to use it for making other records which are to be sold or supplied; and

2.	Subject to the following provisions of this Schedule, the royalty mentioned in paragraph 1 (d) of this Schedule shall be of an amount equal to a percentage of the ordinary retail selling price of the record calculated in the prescribed manner.

3.	If, at any time after the end of the period of one year beginning with the coming into operation of a prescribed rate of royalty it appears to the Commission that the ordinary rate of royalty, or the minimum amount thereof, as prescribed has ceased to be equitable, either generally or in relation to any class of records, the Commission may hold a public inquiry, in the prescribed manner and if, in consequence of such an inquiry, the Commission is satisfied of the need to do so, he may make an order prescribing such different rate or amount, either generally or in relation to any one or more classes of records, as he may consider just:

Provided that, where no order comprising a class of records (either a general order or an order relating specifically to that class, or to that class together with one or more other classes of records), has been made under this paragraph, no further order comprising that class of records shall be made thereunder less than five years after the date on which the previous order comprising that class (or, if more than one, the last previous order comprising that class) was made thereunder.

[No. 98 of 1992.]

4.	In the case of a record which comprises (with or without other material, and either in their original form or in the form of adaptations) two or more musical works in which copyright subsist, if the owners of the copyright in the works are different persons, the royalty shall be apportioned among them in such manner as they may agree or as, in default of agreement, may be determined by arbitration.

5.	Where a record comprises (with or without other material) a performance or a musical work, or of an adaptation of musical work, in which works are sung, or are spoken incidentally to or in association with the music, and either no copyright subsists in that work or, if such copyright subsists, the conditions specified in paragraph 1 of this Schedule are fulfilled in relation to that copyright, then if—

(a)	the works consist or form part of a literary or dramatic work in which copyright subsist; and

(b)	such previous records as are referred to in paragraph 1 (a) of this Schedule were made or imported by, or with the licence of the owner of the copyright in that literary of dramatic work; and

(c)	the conditions specified in paragraphs 1 (b) and id) of this Schedule are fulfilled in relation to the owner of that copyright, the making of the record shall constitute an infringement of the copyright in the literary or dramatic work:

Provided that, this paragraph shall not be construed as requiring more than one royalty to be paid in respect of a record, and if copyright subsists both in the musical work and in the literary or dramatic work, and their owners are different persons, the royalty shall be apportioned among them (or among them and any other person entitled to a share thereof in accordance with the last preceding sub- paragraph) as they may agree or as, in default of agreement, may be determined by arbitration.

[No. 42 of 1992.]

6.	For the purpose of this Schedule, an adaptation of a work shall be taken to be similar to an adaptation thereof contained in previous records if the two adaptations do not substantially differ in their treatment of the work, either in respect of style or (apart from any difference in number) in respect of the performances required for performing them.

7.	Where, for the purposes of paragraph 1 (a) of this Schedule, the record producer requires to know whether such previous records as are mentioned in that sub-paragraph were made or imported as therein mentioned, the record producers may make the prescribed inquiries, and if the owner of the copyright fails to reply to those inquiries within the prescribed period, the previous record shall be taken to have been made or imported, as the case may be, with the licence of the owner of the copyright.

8.	 The provisions of paragraph 7 of this Schedule shall apply in relation to records of part of a work or adaptation as they apply in relation to records of the whole of it:

Provided that paragraph 1 of this Schedule—

(a)	shall not apply to a record of the whole of a work or adaptation unless the previous records referred to in sub-paragraph (a) of that paragraph were records of the whole of the work or of a similar adaptation; and

(b)	shall not apply to a record of part of a work or adaptation unless those previous records were records of, or comprising, that part of the work of a similar adaptation.

9.	Nothing in this Schedule shall be construed as authorising the importation of records which could not lawfully be imported apart from this Schedule; and accordingly, for the purposes of any provision of this Act relating to imported articles, where the question arises whether the making of a record outside Nigeria would have constituted an infringement of copyright if the record had been made in Nigeria, that question shall be determined as if paragraph 1 of this Schedule had not been enacted.

10.	In this Schedule, 'prescribed' means prescribed by regulations made under this Schedule by the Minister and any such regulations made for the purposes of paragraph 1 (d) of this Schedule may provide that the taking of such steps as the Minister considers most convenient for ensuring the receipt of the royalties (by the owner of the copyright) shall be treated as constituting payment of the royalties in accordance with that paragraph.
