19.	Determination of appeal

(1)	The Court of Appeal on any appeal under this Part of this Act against conviction or against an order of acquittal, discharge or dismissal, shall allow the appeal if it thinks that the verdict should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence, or that the judgment of the court below should be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on any question of law or that on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice and in any other case, the Court of Appeal shall, subject to the provisions of subsection (3) of this section and section 20 of this Act, dismiss the appeal:
Provided that the Court of Appeal may, notwithstanding that it is of opinion that the point raised in the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal if it considers that no sub-stantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.

(2)	Where an appellant has been convicted of an offence and the court which tried him could on the information or charge have found him guilty of some other offence, and, on the finding of the trial court, it appears to the Court of Appeal that that court must have been satisfied of facts which proved him guilty of that other offence, the Court of Appeal may, instead of allowing or dismissing the appeal,  
substitute for the verdict found by such court, a verdict of guilty of that other offence and pass such sentence in substitution for the sentence passed at the trial as may be warranted in law for that other offence, not being a sentence of greater severity.

(3)	If on any appeal it appears to the Court of Appeal that, although the appellant was guilty of the act or omission charged against him, he was insane at the time the act was done or omission made so as not to be responsible according to law for his action, the Court of Appeal may quash the sentence passed at the trial and order the appellant to be kept in custody as a person of unsound mind in such place and in such manner as the Court of Appeal may direct until the pleasure of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria be known, and the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria may thereupon and from time to time, give such order for the safe custody of the appellant during pleasure in such place and in such manner as the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria may see fit.

21.	Suspension of order for restoration or payment of compensation or expenses

(1)	Where any law in force in the State from which an appeal is brought has suspended the operation of any order made on conviction by the court before which the appellant was convicted, for the payment of compensation or of any of the expenses of the prosecution, or for the imprisonment or other punishment imposed on the person convicted or for the restoration of any property to any person, and the re-vesting in case of any such conviction in the original owner or his personal representative of the property in stolen goods, such order shall continue to be suspended until the determination of the appeal if notice of appeal, or notice of application for leave to appeal, is given within thirty days of the date of the conviction.

(2)	In cases where the operation of an order is suspended until the determination of the appeal, the order shall not take effect if the conviction is quashed on appeal.

(3)	The Court of Appeal may by order annul or vary any order made by the court before which the appellant was convicted for the payment of compensation or of any other expenses of the prosecution or for the imprisonment or other punishment imposed on the person convicted or for the restoration of any property to any person although the conviction is not quashed, and the order, if annulled, shall not take effect, and, if varied, shall take effect as so varied.

(d)	where any question arising on the appeal involves prolonged examination of documents or accounts, or any scientific or local investigation, which cannot, in the opinion of the Court of Appeal, conveniently be conducted before the Court of Appeal, order the reference of the question in the manner provided by rules of court, or in the absence of rules of court making provision in that behalf, as it may direct, for enquiry and report, to a special commissioner appointed by the Court of Appeal, and act upon the report of any such commissioner so far as it thinks fit to adopt it; and exercise in relation to the proceedings of the Court of Appeal, any other powers which may for the time being be prescribed by rules of court, and issue by any warrants necessary for enforcing the orders or sentences of the Court of Appeal:
