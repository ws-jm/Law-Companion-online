2.	Definition of offence
An act or omission which renders the person doing the act or making the omission liable to punishment under this Code, or under any Act, or law, is called an offence.

3.	Division of offences
Offences are of three kinds, namely, felonies, misdemeanours, and simple offences.
A felony is any offence which is declared by law to be a felony, or is punishable, without proof of previous conviction, with death or with imprisonment for three years or more.
A misdemeanour is any offence which is declared by law to be a misdemeanour, or is punishable by imprisonment for not less than six months, but less than three years.
All offences, other than felonies and misdemeanours, are simple offences.

4.	Attempts to commit offences
When a person, intending to commit an offence, begins to put his intention into execution by means adapted to its fulfilment, and manifests his intention by some overt act, but does not fulfil his intention to such an extent as to commit the offence, he is said to attempt to commit the offence.
It is immaterial, except so far as regards punishment, whether the offender does all that is necessary on his part for completing the commission of the offence, or whether the complete fulfilment of his intention is prevented by circumstances independent of his will, or whether he desists of his own motion from the further prosecution of his intention.
It is immaterial that by reason of circumstances not known to the offender it is impossible in fact to commit the offence.
The same facts may constitute one offence and an attempt to commit another offence.

5.	Arrest without warrant
The expression 'the offender may be arrested without warrant' means that the provisions of this Code relating to the arrest of offenders or suspected offenders without warrant are applicable to the offence in question, either generally or subject to such conditions, if any, as to time, place, or circumstance, or as to the person authorised to make the arrest, as are specified in the particular case.
Except when otherwise stated, the fact that an offence is within the definition of a felony as set forth in this Code imports that the offender may be arrested without warrant.
The expression "the offender cannot be arrested without warrant' means that the provisions of this Code relating to the arrest of offenders or suspected offenders without warrant are not applicable to the offence in question, except subject to such conditions, if any, as to time, place, or circumstance, or as to the person authorised to make the arrest, as are specified in the particular case.

6.	Carnal knowledge
When the term 'carnal knowledge' or the term 'carnal connection' is used in defining an offence, it is implied that the offence, so far as regards that element of it, is complete upon penetration.
"unlawful carnal knowledge' means carnal connection which takes place otherwise than between husband and wife.


CHAPTER 2
Parties to Offences

7.	Principal offenders
When an offence is committed, each of the following persons is deemed to have taken part in committing the offence and to be guilty of the offence, and may be charged with actually committing it—
(a)	every person who actually does the act or makes the omission which constitutes the offence;
(b)	every person who does or omits to do any act for the purpose of enabling or aiding another person to commit the offence;
(c)	every person who aids another person in committing the offence;
(d)	any person who counsels or procures any other person to commit the offence.
In the fourth case, he may be charged either with himself committing the offence or with counselling or procuring its commission.
A conviction of counselling or procuring the commission of an offence entails the same consequences in all respects as a conviction of committing the offence.
Any person who procures another to do or omit to do any act of such a nature that, if he had himself done the act or made the omission, that act or omission would have constituted an offence on his part, is guilty of an offence of the same kind, and is liable to the same punishment, as if he had himself done the act or made the omission; and he may be charged with himself doing the act or making the omission.

8.	Offences committed in prosecution of common purpose
When two or more persons form a common intention to prosecute an unlawful purpose in conjunction with one another, and in the prosecution of such purpose an offence is committed of such a nature that its commission was a probable consequence of the prosecution of such purpose, each of them is deemed to have committed the offence.

9.	Mode of execution immaterial
When a person counsels another to commit an offence, and an offence is actually committed after such counsel by the person to whom it is given, it is immaterial whether the offence actually committed is the same as that counselled or a different one, provided in either case that the facts constituting the offence actually committed are a probable consequence of carrying out the counsel.
In either case, the person who gave the counsel is deemed to have counselled the other person to commit the offence actually committed by him.

10.	Accessories after the fact
A person who receives or assists another who is, to his knowledge, guilty of an offence, in order to enable him to escape punishment, is said to become an accessory after the fact to the offence.
A wife does not become an accessory after the fact to an offence of which her husband is guilty by receiving or assisting him in order to enable him to escape punishment; nor by receiving or assisting, in her husband’s presence and by his authority, another person who is guilty of an offence in the commission of which her husband has taken part, in order to enable that other person to escape punishment; nor does a husband become accessory after die fact to an offence of which his wife is guilty by receiving or assisting her in order to enable her to escape punishment.
In this section the terms 'wife' and 'husband' mean respectively the wife and husband of a Christian marriage.


CHAPTER 3
Application of Criminal Law

10A. Interpretation
(1)	In this Chapter—
[L.N. 155 of I960.]
'Federal law' means any Act enacted by the National Assembly having effect with respect to the Federation and any Act enacted before the 1st day of October, 1960, which under the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria has effect with respect to the Federation;
[Cap. C23.]
'law of a State' means any written law enacted by the House of Assembly of the State or having effect as if it were enacted by the said House of Assembly;
'law' includes any order, rule of court, regulation or proclamation made under the authority of such law.

11.	Effect of changes in law
A person shall not be punished for doing or omitting to do an act unless the act or omission constituted an offence under the law in force when it occurred.

12.	Application of code as to offences wholly or partially committed in Nigeria
Where by the provisions of any Federal law the doing of any act or the making of any omission constituted an offence, those provisions shall apply to every person who is in Nigeria at the time of his doing the act or making the omission.
With regard to such offences which are of such a nature that they comprise several elements, if any acts or omissions or events actually occur, which, if they all occurred in Nigeria, would constitute an offence and any of such acts or omissions or events occur in Nigeria, although all or some of the other acts or omissions or events which, if they occurred in Nigeria, would be elements of the offence occur elsewhere than in Nigeria; then—

(1)	if the act or omission, which in the case of an offence wholly committed in Nigeria would be the initial element of the offence, occurs in Nigeria, the person who does that act or makes that omission is guilty of an offence of the same kind and is liable to the same punishment, as if all the subsequent elements of the offence had occurred in Nigeria; and

(2)	if that act or omission occurs elsewhere than in Nigeria, and the person who does that act or makes that omission afterwards comes into Nigeria, he is by such coming into Nigeria guilty of an offence of the same kind, and is liable to the same punishment, as if that act or omission had occurred in Nigeria and he had been in Nigeria when it occurred.
But in any such case it is a defence to the charge to prove that the accused person did not intend that the act or omission should have effect in Nigeria. This section does not extend to a case in which the only material event that occurs in Nigeria is the death in Nigeria of a person whose death is caused by an act, done or omitted to be done, at a place not in Nigeria and at a time when he was not in Nigeria.

12A. Offences against laws of a State

(1)	Where by the provisions of any law of a State the doing of any act or the making of any omission is constituted an offence, those provisions shall apply to every person who is in the State at the time of his doing the act or making die omission.

(2)	With regard to any such offence which is of such a nature that it comprises several elements, if any acts or omissions or events actually occur, which, if they all occurred in the State, would constitute an offence, and any of such acts or omissions or events occur in the State, although all or some of the other acts or omissions or events which, if they occurred in the State, would be elements of the offence, occur elsewhere than in the State, then—
(a)	if the act or omission, which in the case of an offence committed wholly in the State would be the initial element of the offence, occurs in the State, the person who does that act or makes that omission is guilty of an offence of the same kind and is liable to the same punishment as if all the subsequent elements of the offence had occurred in the State; and
(b)	if that act or omission occurs elsewhere than in the State, and the person who does that act or makes that omission afterwards comes into the State, he is by such coming into the State guilty of an offence of the same kind and is liable to the same punishment, as if that act or omission had occurred in the State and he had been in the State when it occurred.
But in any such case, it is a defence to the charge to prove that the accused person did not intend that the act or omission should have effect in the State. This subsection does not extend to a case in which the only material event that occurs in the State is the death in the State of a person whose death is caused by an act, done or omitted to be done, at a place not in the State and at a time when he was not in the State.

13.	Offences procured or counselled by persons out of Nigeria

(1)	Any person who, having while out of Nigeria procured another to do or omit to do in Nigeria an act of such a nature that if he had himself done the act or made the omission in Nigeria, he would have been guilty of an offence, afterwards comes into Nigeria, is by such coming into Nigeria guilty of an offence of the same kind, and is liable to the same punishment, as if he himself had done the act or made the omission in Nigeria.
Any person who, having while out of Nigeria counselled or procured the commission of an offence which is actually committed in Nigeria, afterwards comes into Nigeria, is by such coming into Nigeria guilty of an offence of the same kind, and is liable to the same punishment, as if he had been in Nigeria when the offence was committed.

(2)	In this section, 'offence' means an offence against any Federal law.

13A. Offences against State laws procured, etc., outside the State
The provisions of section 13 shall apply in relation to offences against a law of the State as they apply in relation to offences against a Federal law but as if references to Nigeria were references to the State.

14.	Offences procured in Nigeria to be committed out of Nigeria
Any person who, while in Nigeria, procures another to do an act or make an omission at a place not in Nigeria of such a nature that, if he had himself done the act or made the omission in Nigeria, he would have been guilty of an offence, and that, if he had himself done the act or made the omission, he would have been guilty of an offence under the laws in force in the place where the act or omission is done or made, is guilty of an offence of the same kind, and is liable to the same punishment, as if the act had been done or the omission had been made in Nigeria.

14A. Offences procured in the State to be committed out of the State
Any person who, while in a State, procures another to do an act or make an omission at a place not in the State of such a nature that if he had himself done the act or made the omission in the State, he would have been guilty of an offence against a law of the State, and that, if he had himself done the act or made the omission, he would have been guilty of an offence under the laws of the place where the act or omission is done or made, is guilty of an offence of the same kind, and is liable to the same punishment, as if the act had been done or the omission had been made in the State.

15.	Armed forces and police forces
Members of the armed forces and of the police force of Nigeria are subject to the special laws relating to the forces to which they respectively belong, but are not exempt from the provisions of this Code.
[L.N. 112 of 1964.]

16.	(Repealed by No. 43 of 1945).


CHAPTER 4 Punishments
17.	Kinds of punishments
Subject to the provisions of any other written law, the punishments which may be inflicted under this Code are death, imprisonment, caning, fine and forfeiture.
[No. 30 of I960.]

18.	Caning for male persons under seventeen
Whenever a male person who, in the opinion of the court, has not attained seventeen years of age, has been found guilty of any offence the court may, in its discretion, order him to be caned in addition to or in substitution for any other punishments to which he is liable.

19.	Forfeiture of bribes
When any person is convicted of an offence under section 98, 98A, 98B, 99, 112, 117, 126, 128 or 494 of this Code, the court may, in addition to or in lieu of any penalty which may be imposed, order the forfeiture to the State of any property which has passed in connection with the commission of the offence or, if such property cannot be forfeited or cannot be found, of such sum as the court shall assess as the value of such property, and any property or sum so forfeited shall be dealt with in such manner as the Governor may direct. Payment of any sum so ordered to be forfeited may be enforced in the same manner and subject to the same incidents as in the case of the payment of a fine.
[No. 30 of 1960, No. 84 of 1966, and L.N. 112 of 1964.]

20.	Forfeiture of property used in postal offences
When any person is convicted of an offence under section 170, 175, 177, 179, 180 or 183 of this Code, the court may, in addition to or in lieu of any penalty which may be imposed, order the forfeiture of any personal property which has been used in the commission of the offence or in respect of which the offence has been committed and may order such property to be destroyed or otherwise dealt with as to it may seem fit.

21.	Prerogative
Nothing in this Code affects the prerogative of mercy where exercised in accordance with the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.
[L.N. 112 of 1964 and Cap. C23J

CHAPTER 5
Criminal Responsibility

22.	Ignorance of law
Ignorance of the law does not afford any excuse for any act or omission which would otherwise constitute an offence, unless knowledge of the law by the offender is expressly declared to be an element of the offence.

23.	Bona fide claim of right
A person is not criminally responsible, as for an offence relating to property, for an act done or omitted to be done by him with respect to any property in the exercise of an honest claim of right and without intention to defraud.

24.	Intention: motive
Subject to the express provisions of this Code relating to negligent acts and omissions, a person is not criminally responsible for an act or omission which occurs independently of the exercise of his will, or for an event which occurs by accident.
Unless the intention to cause a particular result is expressly declared to be an element of the offence constituted, in whole or part, by an act or omission, the result intended to be caused by an act or omission is immaterial.
Unless otherwise expressly declared, the motive by which a person is induced to do or omit to do an act, or to form an intention, is immaterial so far as regards criminal responsibility. 

25.	Mistake of fact
A person who does or omits to do an act under an honest and reasonable, but mistaken, belief in the existence of any state of things, is not criminally responsible for the act or omission to any greater extent than if the real state of things had been such as he believed to exist.
The operation of this rule may be excluded by the express or implied provisions of the law relating to the subject.

26.	Extraordinary emergencies
Subject to the express provisions of this Code relating to acts done upon compulsion or provocation or in self-defence, a person is not criminally responsible for an act done or omission made under such circumstances of sudden or extraordinary emergency that an ordinary person possessing ordinary power of self- control could not reasonably be expected to act otherwise.

27.	Presumption of sanity
Every person is presumed to be of sound mind and to have been of sound mind at any time which comes in question, until the contrary is proved.

28.	Insanity
A person is not criminally responsible for an act or omission if at the time of doing the act or making the omission he is in such a state of mental disease or natural mental infirmity as to deprive him of capacity to understand what he is doing, or of capacity to control his actions, or of capacity to know that he ought not to do the act or make the omission.
A person whose mind, at the time of his doing or omitting to do an act, is affected by delusions on some specific matter or matters, but who is not otherwise entitled to the benefit of the foregoing provisions of this section, is criminally responsible for the act or omission to the same extent as if the real state of things had been such as he was induced by the delusion to believe to exist.

29.	Intoxication

(1)	Save as provided in this section, intoxication shall not constitute a defence to any criminal charge.

(2)	Intoxication shall be a defence to any criminal charge if by reason thereof the person charged at the time of the act or omission complained of did not know that such act or omission was wrong or did not know what he was doing and—
(a)	the state of intoxication was caused without his consent by the malicious or negligent act of another person; or
(b)	the person charged was by reason of intoxication insane, temporarily or otherwise, at the time of such act or omission.

(3)	Where the defence under the preceding subsection is established, then in a case falling under paragraph (a) thereof, the accused person shall be discharged, and in a case falling under paragraph (b), sections 229 and 230 of the Criminal Procedure Act shall apply.

(4)	Intoxication shall be taken into account for the purpose of determining whether the person charged had formed any intention, specific or otherwise, in the absence of which he would not be guilty of the offence.

(5)	For the purposes of this section, 'intoxication' shall be deemed to include a state produced by narcotics or drugs.

30.	Immature age
A person under the age of seven years is not criminally responsible for any act or omission.
A person under the age of twelve years is not criminally responsible for an act or omission, unless it is proved that at the time of doing the act or making the omission he had capacity to know that he ought not to do the act or make the omission.
A male person under the age of twelve years is presumed to be incapable of having carnal knowledge.

31.	Judicial officers
Except as expressly provided by this Code, a judicial officer is not criminally responsible for anything done or omitted to be done by him in the exercise of his judicial functions, although the act done is in excess of his judicial authority or although he is bound to do the act omitted to be done.

32.	Justification and excuse: compulsion
A person is not criminally responsible for an act or omission if he does or omits to do the act under any of the following circumstances—
(1)	in execution of the law;
(2)	in obedience of the order of a competent authority which he is bound by law to obey, unless the order is manifestly unlawful;
(3)	when the act is reasonably necessary in order to resist actual and unlawful violence threatened to him, or to another person in his presence;
(4)	when he does or omits to do the act in order to save himself from immediate death or grievous harm threatened to be inflicted upon him by some person actually present and in a position to execute the threats, and believing himself to be unable otherwise to escape the carrying of the threats into execution,
but this protection does not extend to an act or omission which would constitute an offence punishable with death, or an offence of which grievous harm to the person of another, or an intention to cause such harm, is an element, nor to a person who has by entering into an unlawful association or conspiracy rendered himself liable to have such threats made to him.
Whether an order is or is not manifestly unlawful is a question of law.

33.	Compulsion of husband
A married woman is not free from criminal responsibility for doing or omitting to do an act merely because the act or omission takes place in the presence of her husband.
But a wife of a Christian marriage is not criminally responsible for doing or omitting to do an act which she is actually compelled by her husband to do or omit to do, and which is done or omitted to be done in his presence, except in the case of an act or omission which would constitute an offence punishable with death, or an offence of which grievous harm to the person of another, or an intention to cause such harm, is an element, in which case the presence of her husband is immaterial.

34.	No conspiracy between husband and wife alone
A husband and wife of Christian marriage are not criminally responsible for a conspiracy between themselves alone.

35.	Offences by partners and members of companies with respect to partnership or corporate property
A person who, being a member of a co-partnership, corporation, or joint stock company, does or omits to do any act with respect to the property of the co-partnership, corporation, or company, which, if he were not a member of the co-partnership, corporation or company, would constitute an offence, is criminally responsible to the same extent as if he were not such member.

36.	Liability of husband and wife for offences committed by either with respect to the other’s property
When a husband and wife of a Christian marriage are living together, neither of them incurs any criminal responsibility for doing or omitting to do any act with respect to the property of the other, except in the case of an act or omission of which an intention to injure or defraud some other person is an element, and except in the case of an act done by either of them when leaving or deserting, or when about to leave or desert, the other.
Subject to the foregoing provisions, a husband and wife are, each of them, criminally responsible for any act done by him or her with respect to the property of the other, which would be an offence if they were not husband and wife, and to the same extent as if they were not husband and wife.
But in the case of a Christian marriage neither of them can institute criminal proceedings against the other while they are living together.
In this section, the term 'property' used with respect to a wife means her separate property.

CHAPTER 7
Sedition and the importation of seditious or undesirable publications

50.	Interpretation
(1)	In this Chapter, unless the context otherwise requires—
'import' includes—
(a)	to bring into Nigeria; and
(b)	to bring within the inland waters of Nigeria whether or not the publication is brought ashore, and whether or not there is an intention to bring the same ashore;
[L.N. 112 of 1964 and No. 27 of 1967.]
'periodical publication' includes every publication issued periodically or in parts or numbers at intervals whether regular or irregular;
'publication' includes all written or printed matter and everything, whether of a nature similar to written or printed matter or not, containing any visible representation, or by its form, shape, or in any manner capable of suggesting words or ideas, and every copy and reproduction of any publication;
'seditious publication' means a publication having a seditious intention;
'seditious words' means words having a seditious intention.

(a)	to bring into hatred or contempt or excite disaffection against the person of the President or of the Governor of a State or the Government of the Federation; or
(b)	to excite the citizens or other inhabitants of Nigeria to attempt to procure the alteration, otherwise than by lawful means, of any other matter in Nigeria as by law established; or
(c)	to raise discontent or disaffection amongst the citizens or other inhabitants of Nigeria; or
(d)	to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different classes of the population of Nigeria,
but an act, speech or publication is not seditious by reason only that it intends—
	(i)		to show that the President or the Governor of a State has been misled or mistaken in any measure in the Federation or a State, as the case may be; or
	(ii)	to point out errors or defects in the Government or Constitution of Nigeria, or of any State thereof, as by law established or in legislation or in the administration of justice with a view to the remedying of such errors or defects; or
	(iii)	to persuade the citizens or other inhabitants of Nigeria to attempt to procure by lawful means the alteration of any matter in Nigeria as by law established; or
	(iv)	to point out, with a view to their removal, any matters which are producing or have a tendency to produce feelings of ill-will and enmity between different classes of the population of Nigeria.

(3)	In determining whether the intention with which any act was done, any words were spoken, or any document was published, was or was not seditious, every person shall be deemed to intend the consequences which would naturally follow from his conduct at the time and under the circumstances in which he so conducted himself.

51.	Offences
(1)	Any person who—
(a)	does or attempts to do, or makes any preparation to do, or conspires with any person to do, any act with a seditious intention;
(b)	utters any seditious words;

(2)	Any person who without lawful excuse has in his possession any seditious publication is guilty of an offence and liable on conviction, for a first offence, to imprisonment for one year or to a fine of one hundred naira or to both such imprisonment and fine, and for a subsequent offence, to imprisonment for two years; and such publication shall be forfeited to the State.

52.	Legal proceedings: evidence
(1)	No prosecution for an offence under section 51 of this Code shall be begun except within six months after the offence is committed.
(2)	A person shall not be prosecuted for an offence under section 51 without the written consent of the Attorney-General of the Federation or of the State concerned.
(3)	No person shall be convicted of an offence under section 51 (1) (b) of this Code on the uncorroborated testimony of one witness.

53.	Unlawful oaths to commit capital offences

(2)	A person shall not be convicted of an offence against this section of this Code if he proves that he had not examined the article in respect of which he is charged and had no reasonable cause to suspect that it was such that his publication of it would make him liable to be convicted of an offence against this section of this Code.

The term 'applies force' includes the case of applying heat, light, electrical force, gas, odour, or any other substance of thing whatever, if applied in such a degree as to cause injury or personal discomfort.

253.	Assaults unlawful
An assault is unlawful and constitutes an offence unless it is authorised or justified or excused by law.
The application of force by one person to the person of another may be unlawful, although it is done with the consent of that other person.

254.	Execution of sentence
It is lawful for a person who is charged by law with the duty of executing or giving effect to the lawful sentence of a court (including a customary and an area court) to execute or give effect to that sentence.

255.	Execution of process
It is lawful for a person who is charged by law with the duty of executing the lawful process of a court (including a customary and an area court) and who is required to arrest or detain another person under such process, and for every person lawfully assisting a person so charged, to arrest or detain that other person according to the terms of the process.

256.	Execution of warrant
It is lawful for a person who is charged by law with the duty of executing a lawful warrant issued by any court (including customary and an area court) or judicial officer, or other person having jurisdiction to issue it, and who is required to arrest or detain another person under such warrant, and for every person lawfully assisting a person so charged, to arrest or detain that other person according to the directions of the warrant.

257.	Erroneous sentence or process or warrant
If the sentence was passed, or the process was issued, by a court (including a native tribunal) having jurisdiction under any circumstances to pass such a sentence or to issue such process, or if the warrant was issued by a court (including a customary and an area court) or judicial officer or other person having authority in any circumstances to issue such a warrant, it is immaterial whether the court or judicial officer or person had or had not authority to pass the sentence or issue the process or warrant in the particular case; unless the person executing the same knows that the sentence or process or warrant, was in fact passed or issued without authority.

258.	Sentence or process or warrant without jurisdiction
A person who executes or assists in executing any sentence, or process, or warrant which purports to be passed or issued by a court (including a native tribunal), judicial officer, or other person, and who would be justified, under the provisions of sections 254, 255, 256 and 257 of this Code, in executing the same if it had been passed or issued by a court (including a customary and an area court), or judicial officer, or person, having authority to pass or issue it, is not criminally responsible for any act done in such execution notwithstanding that the court, judicial officer or person, had no authority to pass the sentence or issue the process or warrant, if in such execution he acted in good faith and in the belief that the sentence, process or warrant was that of a court, judicial officer, or other person, having such authority.

259.	Arrest of wrong person
A person who, being duly authorised to execute a warrant to arrest one person, arrests another person, believing in good faith and on reasonable grounds that the person arrested is the person named in the warrant, is not criminally responsible for doing so to any greater extent than if the person arrested had been the person named in the warrant.
Any person who lawfully assists in making such an arrest believing that the person arrested is the person named in the warrant, or who, being required by the warrant to receive and detain the person named in it, receives and detains the person so arrested, is not criminally responsible for doing so to any greater extent than if the person arrested had been the person named in the warrant.

260.	Irregular process or warrant
When any process or warrant is bad in law by reason of some defect in substance or in form apparent on the face of it, a person who, in good faith and believing that it is good in law, acts in the execution of the process or warrant, is not criminally responsible for anything done in such execution to any greater extent than if the process or warrant were good in law.

261.	Force used in executing process or in arrest
It is lawful for a person who is engaged in the lawful execution of any sentence, process or warrant, or in making any arrest, and for any person lawfully assisting him, to use such force as may be reasonably necessary to overcome any force used in resisting such execution or arrest.

271.	Peace officer preventing escape from arrest
When a peace officer or police officer is proceeding lawfully to arrest, with or without warrant, a person for an offence which is a felony, and is such that the offender may be arrested without warrant, and the person sought to be arrested takes to flight in order to avoid arrest, it is lawful for the peace officer or police officer and for any person lawfully assisting him, to use such force as may be reasonably necessary to prevent the escape of the person sought to be arrested, and, if the offence is such that the offender may be punished with death or with imprisonment for seven years or more, may kill him if he cannot by any means otherwise be arrested.

272.	Other cases of preventing escape from arrest
When a person who is not a peace officer or police officer is proceeding lawfully to arrest, without warrant, another person for an offence which is such that the offender may be arrested without warrant, and when any person is proceeding lawfully to arrest another person for any cause other than such an offence, and, in either case, the person sought to be arrested takes to flight in order to avoid arrest, it is lawful for the person seeking to arrest him to use such force as may be reasonably necessary to prevent his escape.
But this section of this Code does not authorize the use of force which is intended or is likely to cause death or grievous harm.

273.	Preventing escape or rescue after arrest
When any person has lawfully arrested another person for any offence, it is lawful for him to use such force as he believes, on reasonable grounds, to be necessary to prevent the escape or rescue of the person arrested.
But, if the offence is not one which is such that the offender may be arrested without warrant, this section of this Code shall not authorize the use of force which is intended or is likely to cause death or grievous harm.

274.	(Repealed by No. 43 of 1945).

275.	Preventing a breach of the peace
It is lawful for any person who witnesses a breach of the peace to interfere to prevent the continuance or renewal of it, and to use such force as is reasonably necessary for such prevention and is reasonably proportioned to the danger to be apprehended from such continuance or renewal, and to detain any person who is committing or who is about to join in or to renew the breach of the peace for such time as may be reasonably necessary in order to give him into the custody of a peace officer or police officer.

It is lawful for a peace officer or police officer who witnesses a breach of the peace, and for any person lawfully assisting him, to arrest any person whom he finds committing it, or whom he believes on reasonable grounds to be about to join or renew the breach of the peace.

It is lawful for a peace officer or police officer to receive into custody and detain in custody any person given into his charge as having been a party to a breach of the peace by a person whom the peace officer or police officer believes, on reasonable grounds, to have witnessed the breach of the peace.

276.	Suppression of riot
It is lawful for any person to use such force as is necessary to suppress a riot, and is reasonably proportioned to the danger to be apprehended from its continuance.

277.	Suppression of riot by peace officers
It is lawful for a peace officer to use or order to be used such force as he believes, on reasonable grounds, to be necessary in order to suppress a riot, and is reasonably proportioned to the danger which he believes, on reasonable grounds, is to be apprehended from its continuance.

278.	Suppression of riot by person acting under lawful orders
It is lawful for any person acting in good faith in obedience to orders, not manifestly unlawful, given by a peace officer for the suppression of a riot, to use such force as he believes, on reasonable grounds, to be necessary for carrying such orders into effect. Whether any particular order so given is or is not manifestly lawful, is a question of law.

279.	Suppression of riot by person acting without order in case of emergency
When any person, whether subject to military law or not, believes, on reasonable grounds, that serious mischief will arise from a riot before there is time to procure the intervention of a peace officer, it is lawful for him to use such force as he believes, on reasonable grounds, to be necessary for the suppression of the riot, and as is reasonably proportioned to the danger which he believes, on reasonable grounds, is to be apprehended from its continuance.

[L.N. 112 of 1964.]

281.	Prevention of offences for which an offender may be arrested without warrant: prevention of violence by persons of unsound mind
It is lawful for any person to use such force as is reasonably necessary in order to prevent the commission of an offence which is such that the offender may be arrested without warrant; or in order to prevent any act from being done as to which he believes, on reasonable grounds, that it would, if done, amount to any such offence; or in order to prevent a person whom he believes, on reasonable grounds, to be of unsound mind, from doing violence to any person or property.

282.	Defence of dwelling-house
It is lawful for any person who is in peaceable possession of a dwelling-house, and for any person lawfully assisting him or acting by his authority, to use such force as he believes, on reasonable grounds, to be necessary in order to prevent the forcible breaking and entering of the dwelling-house, either by night or day, by any person whom he believes on reasonable grounds, to be attempting to break and enter the dwelling- house with intent to commit a felony or misdemeanour therein.

283.	Provocation
The term 'provocation”, used with reference to an offence of which an assault is an element, includes, except as hereinafter stated, any wrongful act or insult of such nature as to be likely, when done to an ordinary person, or in the presence of the ordinary person to another person who is under his immediate care, or to whom he stands in a conjugal, parental, filial, or fraternal relation, or in the relation of master or servant, to deprive him of the power of self-control, and to induce him to assault the person by whom the act or insult is done or offered.
When such an act or insult is done or offered by one person to another, or in the presence of another to a person who is under the immediate care of that other, or to whom the latter stands in any such relation as aforesaid, the former is said to give to the latter provocation for an assault.
A lawful act is not provocation to any person for an assault.
An act which a person does in consequence of excitement given by another person in order to induce him to do the act, and thereby to furnish an excuse for committing an assault, is not provocation to that person for an assault.
An arrest which is unlawful is not necessarily provocation for an assault, but it may be evidence of provocation to a person who knows of the illegality.

284.	Defence of provocation
A person is not criminally responsible for an assault committed upon a person who gives him provocation for the assault, if he is in fact deprived by the provocation of the power of self-control, and acts upon it on the sudden and before there is time for his passion to cool; provided that the force used is not disproportionate to the provocation, and is not intended, and is not such as is likely, to cause death or grievous harm.
Whether any particular act or insult is such as to be likely to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control and to induce him to assault the person by whom the act or insult is done or offered, and whether, in any particular case, the person provoked was actually deprived by the provocation of the power of self-control, and whether any force used is or is not disproportionate to the provocation, are questions of fact.

285.	Prevention of repetition of insult
It is lawful for any person to use such force as is reasonably necessary to prevent the repetition of an act or insult of such a nature as to be provocation to him for an assault:
Provided that the force used is not intended and is not such as is likely, to cause death or grievous harm.

286.	Self-defence against unprovoked assault
When a person is unlawfully assaulted, and has not provoked the assault, it is lawful for him to use such force to the assailant as is reasonably necessary to make effectual defence against the assault:
Provided that the force used is not intended, and is not such as is likely, to cause death or grievous harm.
If the nature of the assault is such as to cause reasonable apprehension of death or grievous harm, and the person using force by way of defence believes, on reasonable ground, that he cannot otherwise preserve the person defended from death or grievous harm, it is lawful for him to use any such force to the assailant as is necessary for defence, even though such force may cause death or grievous harm.

287.	Self-defence against provoked assault
When a person has unlawfully assaulted another or has provoked an assault from another, and that other assaults him with such violence as to cause reasonable apprehension of death or grievous harm, and to induce him to believe, on reasonable grounds, that it is necessary for his preservation from death or grievous harm to use force in self-defence, he is not criminally responsible for using any such force as is reasonably necessary for such preservation, although such force may cause death or grievous harm.
This protection does not extend to a case in which the person using force, which causes death or grievous harm, first began the assault with intent to kill or to do grievous harm to some person; nor to a case in which the person using force which causes death or grievous harm endeavoured to kill or to do grievous harm to some person before the necessity of so preserving himself arose; nor, in either case, unless, before such necessity arose, the person using such force declined further conflict, and quitted it or retreated from it as far as was practicable.

288.	Aiding in self-defence
In any case in which it is lawful for any person to use force in any degree for the purpose of defending himself against an assault, it is lawful for any other person acting in good faith in his aid to use a like degree of force for the purpose of defending such first-mentioned person.

289.	Defence of movable property against trespassers
It is lawful for any person who is in peaceable possession of any movable property, and for any person acting by his authority, to use such force as is reasonably necessary in order to resist the taking of such property by a trespasser, or in order to retake it from a trespasser, provided that he does not do harm to the trespasser.

290.	Defence of movable property with claim of right
When a person is in peaceable possession of any movable property under a claim of right, it is lawful for him, and for any person acting by his authority, to use such force as is reasonably necessary in order to defend his possession of the property, even against a person who is entitled by law to possession of the property, provided that he does not do harm to such other person.

291.	Defence of movable property without claim of right
When a person who is entitled by law to the possession of movable property, attempts to take from a person who is in possession of the property, but who neither claims right to it, nor acts by the authority of a person who claims right, and the person in possession resists him, it is lawful for the person so entitled to possession to use force in order to obtain possession of the property, provided that he does not do harm to the person in possession.

292.	Defence of premises against trespassers: removal of disorderly persons
It is lawful for a person who is in peaceable possession of any land, structure, vessel or place, or who is entitled to the control or management of any land, structure, vessel, or place, and for any person acting by his authority, to use such force as is reasonably necessary in order to prevent any person from wrongfully entering upon such land, structure, vessel, or place, or in order to remove therefrom a person who wrongfully remains therein, provided that he does not do harm to such person.
It is lawful for a person who is in peaceable possession of any land, structure, vessel, or place, or who is entitled to the control or management of any land, structure, vessel, or place, and for any person acting by his authority, to use force in order to remove therefrom any person who conducts himself in a disorderly manner therein, provided that he does not do him harm.
The term 'place' includes any part of an enclosure or structure, whether separated from the rest of the enclosure or structure, by a partition, fence, rope, or any other means, or not.

293.	Defence of possession of real property or vessel with claim of right
When a person is in peaceable possession of any land, structure, or vessel, with a claim of right, it is lawful for him, and for any person acting by his authority, to use such force as is reasonably necessary in order to defend his possession, even against a person who is entitled by law to the possession of the property provided that he does not do harm to such person.

294.	Exercise of right of way or easement
When a person who claims to be lawfully entitled to enter upon land for the exercise of a right of way or other easement or profit, enters upon the land for the purpose of exercising such right of way, or easement or profit, after notice that his right to use such way or take such profit is disputed by the person in possession of the land, or having entered persists in his entry after such notice, it is lawful for the person in possession, and for any person acting by his authority, to use such force as is reasonably necessary for the purpose of making the person so entering desist from the entry, provided that he does not do him harm.

295.	Correction of child, servant, etc.
A blow or other force, not in any case extending to a wound or grievous harm, may be justified for the purpose of correction as follows—
