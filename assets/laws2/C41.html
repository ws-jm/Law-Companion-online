warrant for the arrest of the accused person and, after giving the accused person an opportunity of being heard, may either commit him to prison to await trial or admit him to bail for the same or an increased amount as the judge or magistrate may think just.

If in the course of the hearing, circumstances should appear which cause the court to be of the opin-ion that the offence, on account of its aggravated character or other sufficient reason, is not suitable to be disposed of by such court, then such court, may, instead of adjudicating, commit the accused for trial before the High Court and shall follow the procedure in Part 36 of this Act, in relation to preliminary inquiries.

Provided that where the prosecution is conducted by a law officer the magistrate shall not deal with the case summarily without the consent of that law officer.
Procedure for obtaining consent to summary trial
(2)	If a magistrate at any time during the hearing of a charge for such an indictable offence as aforesaid against a person who is an adult becomes satisfied that it is expedient to deal with the case summarily, the magistrate shall thereupon, for the purpose of proceedings under this section, cause the charge to be reduced into writing, if this has not been already done, and read to the accused and shall address to him a question to the following effect—
'Do you desire to be tried by a judge of the High Court or with a jury, as the case may, or do you consent to the case being dealt with summarily by this court?”
with a statement, if the magistrate thinks such a statement desirable, of the meaning of the case being dealt with summarily and of the sitting of the High Court at which he is likely to be tried, if committed for trial and, if the accused consents to be tried summarily, shall forthwith ask him the following question—
'Do you plead guilty or not guilty?”
Trial without consent void
(3)	If the magistrate shall not inform the accused of his right to be tried by a judge of the High Court or with a jury, as the case may be, the trial shall be null and void ab initio unless the accused  
consents at any time before being called upon to make his defence to be tried summarily by a magis-trate in which case the trial shall proceed as if the accused had consented to being tried summarily by a magistrate before the magistrate proceeded to hear evidence in the case.
(4)	Any written law in force at the commencement of this Act which relates to the summary trial by a magistrate of indictable offences or which refers to indictable offences which are triable summarily by a magistrate shall, subject to the provisions of this section, be construed, as the case may be, as applying to summary trial by a magistrate of indictable offences under this section or as referring to all indictable offences which are triable summarily by a magistrate thereunder.
305.	Power to remand person charged
(1)	A magistrate, without prejudice to any other power which he may possess may, for the purpose of ascertaining whether it is expedient to deal with a case summarily, either before or during the hearing of the case, adjourn the case and remand the person charged.

307.	Adjournment for law officer’s decision
Where an adult charged with an indictable offence is being tried summarily by a magistrate, such magistrate shall, at the request of any person in charge of the prosecution made at any time before the decision in the case, adjourn the hearing of the charge in order that a law officer may be consulted with a view to obtaining an order as in the last immediately preceding section mentioned to have the case dealt with as one for trial on information.
308.	General provisions as dealing summarily with indictable offence
Where an indictable offence is in the circumstances mentioned in this Part of this Act authorised to be dealt with summarily by a magistrate—
(a)	the procedure shall, until the court assumes the power to deal with the offence summarily, be the same in all respects as if the offence were to be dealt with throughout as an indictable of-fence, but when and so soon as the court assumes the power to deal with such offence sum-marily, the procedure shall be the same from and after that period as if the offence were a summary conviction offence and not an indictable offence, and the other provisions of this Act shall apply accordingly:
Provided that nothing herein contained shall be construed to prevent the court from dealing thereafter with the offence as an indictable offence, if it thinks fit so to do;
(b)	the evidence of any witness taken before the court assumed the power to deal with the offence summarily need not be taken again but every such witness shall, if the defendant so requires, be recalled for the purpose of cross-examination;
(c)	the conviction for any such offence shall be of the same effect as a conviction on a trial on information for the offence;
(d)	where the court has assumed the power to deal with the offence summarily and dismisses the complaint on the merits it shall, if required, deliver to the person charged a copy, certified under the hand of the magistrate, of the order of dismissal, and such dismissal shall be of the same effect as an acquittal on a trial on indictment for the offence.
309.	Security for keeping the peace, in indictable cases tried summarily
Any person convicted of any indictable offence tried summarily may, instead of or in addition to any punishment to which he is liable, be ordered to enter into his own recognisance, with or without sureties, in such amount as the court thinks fit that he shall keep the peace and be of good behaviour for a time to be fixed by the court and may be ordered to be imprisoned until such recognisance, with sureties if so directed, is entered into but so that the imprisonment for not entering into the recognisance shall not extend for a term longer than one year and shall not together with the fixed term of imprisonment, if any, extend for a term longer than the longest term for which he might be sentenced to be imprisoned without fine.

314.	Provisions as to taking of depositions and caution to and statement of accused on proceedings before magistrate
(1)	If at the close of the evidence for the prosecution a prima facie case has in the opinion of the magistrate been established against the accused, immediately after the last witness for the prosecution has been bound over to attend the trial, the magistrate shall again read the charge or read the amended or substituted charge to the accused and explain the nature thereof to him in ordinary language and inform him that he has the right to call witnesses and, if he so desires, to give evidence on his own behalf.
(2)	After so doing, the magistrate shall then address to him the following words or words to the like effect—
'Do you wish to say anything in answer to the charge? You are not obliged to say anything unless you desire to do so, but whatever you say will be taken down in writing and may be given in evidence upon your trial.”
(3)	Before the accused makes any statement in answer to the charge, the magistrate shall state to him and give him clearly to understand that he has nothing to hope from any promise of favour and nothing to fear from any threat which may have been held out to him to induce him to make any admission or confession of his guilt, but that whatsoever he then says may be given in evidence on his trial notwithstanding the promise or threat.
(4)	(a) Whatever the accused then states in answer to the charge shall be taken down in full and shall be read over to the accused who shall be at full liberty to explain or add to his statement which shall be signed by the magistrate and also, if the accused so desires, by him and shall be transmitted to the court of trial with the depositions of the witnesses in manner hereinafter provided.
(b) On the trial, the statement of the accused taken down as aforesaid, and whether signed by him or not, may be given in evidence without further proof thereof unless it is proved that the magistrate purporting to sign the statement did not in fact sign it.

(b)	If the accused, in answer to the question, states that he wishes to give evidence but not to call witnesses the magistrate shall proceed to take forthwith the evidence of the accused, and after the conclusion of the evidence of the accused the legal practitioner if any, appearing for the accused, shall be heard on his behalf if he so desires.
(c)	If the accused in answer to the question states that he desires to give evidence on his own behalf and to call witnesses or to call witnesses only, the magistrate shall proceed to take either forthwith, or if an address is to be made by a legal practitioner on behalf of the accused after the conclusion of that address, the evidence of the accused, if he desires to give evidence himself, and of the witness called by him who knows anything relating to the facts and circumstances of the case or anything tending to prove the innocence of the accused.
(d)	All statements made by the accused shall be taken down in writing and all evidence given by him or any such witness as aforesaid under this subsection shall be taken down in writing in the form of a deposition and the provisions of section 312 (e) of this Act relating to the reading over and signing of depositions of witnesses for the prosecution shall apply to such depositions and such statement and depositions shall be transmitted to the court of trial together with the other depositions of the witnesses for the prosecution.
315.	Procedure where witness for defence not present
If the accused person states that he has witnesses to call but that they are not present in court and the court is satisfied that the absence of the witnesses is not due to any fault or neglect of the accused and that there is a likelihood that they could if present give material evidence on his behalf, the court may adjourn the inquiry and issue process, or take other steps, to compel the attendance of such witnesses.
316.	Binding over of witnesses for defence
(1) The magistrate holding the preliminary inquiry shall bind over every witness for the defence whose evidence is, in the opinion of the magistrate, material, to give evidence at the trial of the accused person before the court.

318.	Court may take further evidence after close of case for prosecution
Notwithstanding anything contained in sections 312, 314, 315 and 319 of this Act, the magistrate may if he thinks fit and although the case for the prosecution has been closed, take the evidence of further witnesses for the prosecution or recall any witness for further examination.
319.	Deposition of witness unable to attend
(1)	Where any person able to give material evidence in respect of an indictable offence in respect of which a preliminary inquiry is proceeding is, from illness or injury, unable to attend at the place where the magistrate usually sits, any magistrate shall have power to take the deposition of such person at the place where such person is.
(2)	The magistrate taking the deposition shall, where practicable, by an order in writing under his hand, cause reasonable notice to be served on the prosecutor and the accused, if not in custody, of his intention to take the same and of the time and place where it is to be taken; and if the accused is in cus-tody, direct the officer in charge of the prison having the custody of the accused to cause him to be conveyed to the place where the examination is to be taken, for the purpose of being present when it is taken, and to be taken back to prison afterwards.

(4)	Every deposition taken under this section, if such deposition was taken by some other magistrate, shall be forwarded to the magistrate by whom the preliminary inquiry into such indictable offence is being or has been held and such deposition shall be treated in all respects in the same way and shall be considered for all purposes as a deposition taken upon the preliminary inquiry.
(5)	In this section 'magistrate' includes a magistrate of a court established for any other State.
320.	A magistrate may continue a preliminary inquiry begun by another magistrate
Should the magistrate initiating the preliminary inquiry be unable for any sufficient reason to continue it after an adjournment, it shall not be necessary for his successor to recommence such inquiry, unless it appears to him that the case is one on which he should adjudicate finally, but he shall read over aloud in the presence of the parties the depositions already taken.
321.	Marking of exhibits
The magistrate taking depositions shall cause all writings and other articles exhibited by the wit-nesses, or any of them, to be inventoried and labelled, or otherwise marked, in the presence of the person producing the same, so that the same may be identified at the trial. 
322.	Magistrate to authenticate depositions and statement of the accused

324.	Where evidence contradictory
Where there is a conflict of evidence, the magistrate shall consider the evidence to be sufficient to put the accused on his trial if the evidence against him is such as, if uncontradicted, would raise a probable presumption of his guilt.
Discharge and committal for trial
325.	Discharge
(1)	If the court considers that the evidence against the accused is not sufficient to put him on his trial, the court shall forthwith order him to be discharged as to the particular charge under inquiry but such discharge shall not be a bar to any subsequent charge in respect of the same facts.
(2)	If the accused is discharged, any recognisance taken in respect of the charge shall then become void.
(3)	Nothing contained in this section shall prevent the court from either forthwith, or after such ad-journment of the investigation as may seem expedient in the interest of justice, proceed to investigate any other charge upon which the accused may have been summoned or otherwise brought before the court, or which in the course of the charge so dismissed as aforesaid it may be appear that the accused has committed.
326.	Commitment
If the magistrate considers the evidence sufficient to put the accused on his trial, he shall commit him for trial to the High Court and shall, until the trial, either admit him to bail or send him to prison for safe keeping; the warrant of the magistrate’s court shall be sufficient authority to the person in charge of any prison appointed for the custody of prisoners committed for trial, although out of the district to which such magistrate is assigned.
[L.N. 47 of 1955.]
327.	Allegation at preliminary inquiry that accused was insane at time of offence
When the accused appears to be of sound mind at the time of the preliminary enquiry, the court, notwithstanding that it is alleged that at the time when the act was committed, in respect of which the accused person is charged, he was by reason of unsoundness of mind incapable of knowing the nature of the act or that it was wrong and contrary to law, shall proceed with the case, and, if the accused ought to be committed for trial, the court shall so commit him.
328.	Procedure when accused does not understand proceedings
If the accused, though not insane, cannot be made to understand the proceedings, the magistrate may proceed with the preliminary investigation; and if such investigation results in a committal for trial, the proceedings shall be forwarded to the High Court with a report of the circumstances, and the High Court shall pass thereon such order as may deem necessary in the circumstance.
[L.N. 47 of 1955.]

(2)	Where a witness has been, or is to be treated as having been, bound over conditionally to attend the trial, the prosecutor or the person committed for trial may give notice—
(a)	at any time before the record of the preliminary inquiry is transmitted to the court of trial in accordance with the provisions of section 330 of this Act, to the registrar of the magistrate’s court; and
(b)	at any time thereafter to the registrar of the court of trial,
that he desires the witness to attend at the trial, and any such registrar to whom any such notice is given, shall forthwith notify the witness that he is required so to attend in pursuance of the recognisance.
[No. 13 of 1953.]
(3)	The magistrate shall on committing the accused for trial inform him of his right to require the attendance at the trial of any such witness as aforesaid and of the steps which he must take for the pur-pose of enforcing such attendance.
(4)	Where any person has been committed for trial for any offence, the deposition of a witness whose attendance at the trial is stated to be unnecessary in accordance with the provisions of subsections (1), (2) and (3) of this section may, if the conditions hereinafter set out are satisfied, without further proof be read as evidence on the trial of that person, whether for that offence or for any other offence arising out of the same transaction, or set of circumstances, as that offence; the conditions hereinbefore referred to are the following—
(a)	it must be proved at the trial, either by a certificate purporting to be signed by the magistrate before whom the deposition purports to have been taken or by the oath of a credible witness, that the deposition was taken in the presence of the accused and that the accused or a legal practitioner on his behalf had full opportunity of cross-examining the witness;
(b)	the deposition must purport to be signed by the magistrate before whom it purports to have been taken:
Provided that the provisions of this subsection shall not have effect in any case in which it is proved—
(i)	that the deposition, or, where the proof required by paragraph (a) of this subsection is given by means of a certificate, that the certificate, was not in fact signed by the magistrate by whom it purports to be signed; or
(ii)	that the witness by whom the deposition was made has been duly notified that he is re-quired to attend the trial.
Transmission of depositions, recognisances and exhibits
330.	Returns to be made to court and law officer, or Director of Public Prosecutions or a State counsel

[Order No. 47 of 1951. and L.N. 1 of 1955.]
331.	Depositions free of charge for persons committed
A person who has been committed for trial shall be furnished, free of charge, before the trial with a copy of the depositions and where practicable of any documents which have been put in evidence:
Provided that if the person committed states that he does not require such copies, it shall not be necessary to supply them.
Adjudication by magistrate instead of committal for trial
332.	When court may adjudicate finally
If it shall appear to the magistrate in the course of a preliminary inquiry that the offence is one which the court has jurisdiction to try summarily and is of such a nature that it can be suitably dealt with under the powers in criminal cases possessed by the court, he may, subject to the provisions of Parts 33 and 35 of this Act, hear and finally determine the matter, and either convict the accused or dismiss the charge:
Provided that in every such case the accused shall be entitled to have recalled for cross- examination all witnesses for the prosecution whom he had not already cross-examined or fully cross- examined.

(2)	Any directions given by a Law Officer or State Counsel under this section shall be in writing signed by him, and shall be put into effect by the magistrate.
(3)	The Law Officer or State Counsel may at any time add to, alter or revoke any such directions.
(4)	If, upon receipt of the depositions and other documents mentioned in section 330 of this Act, whether or not the inquiry has been reopened under this section, a Law Officer is of opinion that the accused person should not have been committed for trial but that the case should have been dealt with summarily, the Law Officer may, if he thinks fit, refer the case back to the magistrate with directions to deal with the same accordingly, and with such other directions as he may think proper.
(5)	When a Law Officer or State Counsel directs that an inquiry shall be reopened or where a Law Officer directs that a case shall be dealt with summarily, the following provisions shall have effect—
(a)	if the accused is in custody, the magistrate shall by an order in writing under his hand direct the officer in charge of the prison having the custody of such accused person to convey him or cause him to be conveyed to the place named in such order for the purpose of being dealt with as the magistrate may direct;
(b)	if the accused person is on bail, the magistrate shall issue a summons for his attendance at a time and place named in such summons and if the accused person does not attend in obedi-ence to such summons, the magistrate shall issue a warrant for his apprehension and in either event the proceedings shall thereafter be continued under the provisions of Parts 33 and 35 of this Act.

Assessment of fine
391.	Payment and allocation of fines and fees
A court, in fixing the amount of any fine to be imposed on an offender, shall take into consideration, amongst other things, the means of the offender so far as they appear or are known to the court and where a fine is imposed the payment of the court fees and police fees payable in the case up to and including conviction, shall not be taken into consideration in fixing the amount of the fine or be imposed in addition to the fine, but the amount of the fine, or of such part thereof as may be paid or recovered, shall be applied as follows—

(b)	in the second place the payment of any court fees not already paid by the informant or com-plainant which may be payable under rules of court;
(c)	the balance, if any, remaining after the aforesaid payments have been made shall be paid into general revenue.

(a)	issue a warrant of commitment forthwith;
(b)	allow time for the payment of the said sum;

security, either with or without a surety or sureties, for the payment of the said sum or any instalment thereof.
Allowance of further time and payment by instalments

Default in one payment renders all payable
(3)	Where a sum of money is directed to be paid by instalments and default is made in the payment of any one instalment, the same proceedings may be taken as if default had been made in the payment of all the instalments then remaining unpaid.
Surrender before committal date
(4)	If, before the expiration of the time allowed, the person convicted surrenders himself to the court having jurisdiction to issue a warrant of commitment in respect of the non-payment of such sum as aforesaid, and states that he prefers immediate committal to awaiting the expiration of the time allowed, the court may, if it thinks fit, forthwith issue a warrant committing him to prison.
393.	Power to postpone issue of warrant of commitment
(1)	If the person liable to pay any sum and to whom time has been given to pay, either with or without a surety or sureties, makes default in such payment or fails to enter into the security required by the court, the court may issue its warrant of commitment requiring any police officer to take and convey such person to prison and there deliver him to the officer in charge of the prison, and requiring the officer in charge of the prison to receive such person into the prison and there to imprison him with or without hard labour, as the case may be, for such time as may be directed and appointed by the warrant of commitment, unless the sum of money adjudged to be paid by the order and also all other costs, charges, and expenses shall be sooner paid.
(2)	Where application is made to the court for a warrant for committing a person to prison for non-payment of any sum of money adjudged to be paid by an order, the court may, if it deems it expedient so to do, postpone the issue of such warrant until such time and on such conditions, if any, as to the court may seem just.
(3)	When the court orders the imprisonment of any person, the court may, if it thinks fit, order that such imprisonment shall not commence forthwith, but shall commence on any day not more than three months after the date of such order as the court may fix, and in such case the court may either suffer the person to go at large until such day or discharge him upon his entering into a recognisance, with or without sureties, conditioned for his reappearance on such day to undergo such imprisonment.
(4)	Any warrant of commitment issued under the provisions of this section may be executed on any day, including a Sunday or a public holiday.
394.	Payment of penalty to person executing warrant

397.	Right of person imprisoned in default to be released on paying sum
(1)	Where any person has been committed to prison by the court for non-payment of any sum of money adjudged to be paid by an order, such person may pay or cause to be paid to the officer in charge of the prison the sum mentioned in the warrant of commitment together with the amount of the costs, charges and expenses, if any, also mentioned therein and the officer in charge of the prison shall receive the same and thereupon discharge such person unless he is in custody for some other matter.
(2)	In any case where under the last preceding subsection a sum has been received in part satisfac-tion of a sum due from a prisoner in consequence of the conviction of the court, such sum shall be applied firstly, towards the payment in full or in part of any costs or damages or compensation which the court may have ordered to be paid to the complainant and secondly, towards the payment of the fine, if any, imposed on the prisoner.
Part payment after commitment
(3)	Subject to the provisions of subsection (2) of this section, where an amount is paid towards a fine, the procedure as hereunder in this subsection set forth shall be followed—
(a)	the imprisonment shall be reduced by a number of days bearing as nearly as possible the same proportion to the total number of days for which such person is committed as the sum so paid towards the fine bears to the amount of the fine for which such person is liable;
(b)	the superintendent or other officer in charge of a prison in which is confined a person who has made such part payment shall as soon as practicable thereafter take such person before a court and such court shall certify the amount by which the term of imprisonment originally awarded is reduced by such payment in part satisfaction and shall make such order as is required in the circumstances:
Provided that where in the opinion of the superintendent or other officer as aforesaid the delay occasioned by taking such person before a court shall be such that the person will be detained beyond the date upon which he should by reason of such part payment be released, such superintendent or other officer may release such person on the day which appears to such superintendent or other officer to be the correct day, endorse the warrant accordingly and shall as soon as practicable thereafter inform the court of the action taken and such court shall thereupon make such order or record as the court may consider to be required in the circumstances.
(4)	In reckoning the number of days by which any term of imprisonment would be reduced under this section, the first day of imprisonment shall not be taken into account and in reckoning the sum which will secure the reduction of a term of imprisonment, fractions of a kobo shall be omitted.

398.	Fines may be ordered to be recoverable by distress
Where under the authority of any written law the court imposes a fine or any pecuniary penalty whether or not that fine or penalty is accompanied by a power to impose imprisonment and no special provision other than recovery by distress is made for the recovery of such fine or penalty, the court may  
order such fine or penalty to be recoverable by distress and in default of such distress satisfying the amount of the fine or penalty as aforesaid, may order that the offender be imprisoned, with or without hard labour as the case may be, in accordance with the scale set forth in section 390 of this Act.

(e)	subject as aforesaid, the goods distrained on shall be sold within the time fixed by the war
rant, unless the sum for which the warrant was issued and also the charges, if any, of taking and keeping the goods distrained on, are sooner paid;
(f)	if any person charged with the execution of a warrant of distress wilfully retains from the proceeds of any property sold to satisfy the distress, or otherwise exacts, any greater costs or charges than those to which he is for the time being entitled, by law, or makes any improper charge, he shall be liable, on summary conviction before a magistrate, to a penalty not ex-ceeding twenty naira:
Provided that nothing herein contained shall affect the liability of any such person to be prosecuted and punished for extortion;
(g)	a written account of the costs and charges incurred in respect of the execution of any warrant of distress shall, as soon as practicable, be delivered by the person charged with the execution of the warrant to the magistrate; and it shall be lawful for the person upon whose movable property the distress was levied, at any time within one month after the making of the distress, to inspect such account, without payment of any fee or reward, at any time during office hours, and to take a copy of such account;
(h)	a person charged with the execution of a warrant of distress shall sell the distress or cause the same to be sold, and may deduct out of the amount realised by such sale all costs and charges actually incurred in effecting such sale, and shall pay to the magistrate or to some person specified by him, the remainder of such amount, in order that the same may be applied in payment of the sum for which the warrant was issued and of the proper costs and charges of the execution of the warrant, and that the surplus, if any, may be rendered to the person upon whose movable property the distress was levied.
400.	Part payment reduces period of imprisonment in proportion
Where a part only of the amount ordered to be recovered by distress is so recovered the period of imprisonment ordered to be suffered in default of recovery of the amount imposed shall be reduced accordingly and shall bear the same proportion to the full period as the amount recovered bears to the total amount ordered to be recovered, the warrant of commitment shall be drawn up accordingly and after such committal, the provisions of section 397 of this Act shall apply.

Provided that in the case of a young person it shall not be obligatory on the court so to commit him if the court is of opinion that he is of so unruly a character that he cannot be safely so committed, or that he is so depraved a character that he is not a fit person to be so detained or that no person can be found who will agree to undertake the custody of such child.
(2)	A commitment under this section may be varied or, in the case of a young person who proves to be of so unruly a character that he cannot be safely detained in such custody or to be of so depraved a character that he is not a fit person to be so detained or the custody of whom no person can be found to agree to undertake, revoked by any court and if it is revoked the young person may be committed to prison.

427.	Methods of dealing with children and young persons charged with offence
Where a child or young person charged with any offence is tried by any court, and the court is satis-fied of his guilt, the court shall take into consideration the manner in which, under the provisions of this or any other Act enabling the court to deal with the case, the case should be dealt with, namely whether—

(k) where the offender is apparently fourteen years old or upwards, by sentencing him to impris-onment; or
(/) by dealing with the case in any other manner in which it may be legally dealt with:
Providing that nothing in this section shall be construed as authorising the court to deal with any case in any manner in which it could not deal with the case apart from this section.

Where a child is charged before a magistrate’s court with an offence and the court deals with the case summarily, the court may not inflict on him a fine exceeding four naira.

(1)	Where a child or young person is charged before any court with any offence for the commission of which a fine, damages, or costs may be imposed and the court is of opinion that the case would be best met by the imposition of a fine, damages, or costs, whether with or without any other punishment, the court may in any case, and shall if the offender is a child, order that the fine, damages, or costs awarded be paid by the parent or guardian of the child or young person instead of by the child or young person, unless the court is satisfied that the parent or guardian cannot be found or that the parent or guardian has not conduced to the commission of the offence by neglecting to exercise due care of the child or young person.
(2)	Where a child or young person is charged with any offence, the court may order his parent or guardian to give security for his good behaviour.

(4)	Upon the review of an order the judge may—
(а)	confirm or vary the order or substitute a new order; or
(б)	if it appears to him that—
(i)	the charge is of a trivial nature; or
(ii)	the application for the return of the person has not been made in good faith in the interests of justice; or
(iii)	for any reason it would be unjust or oppressive to return the person either at all or until the expiration of a certain period,
order the discharge of the person or order that the person be returned after the expiration of a period specified in the order and that he be released on bail until the expiration of that period.
(5)	For the purposes of this section—
(a)	a judge has the same power to admit a person to bail as he has in the case of persons appre-hended under warrants issued by him or by any magistrate or justice of the peace of the State in which he exercises jurisdiction;
(b)	a judge, in varying an order relating to admittance to bail or substituting a new order admitting a person to bail, may impose terms requiring the person apprehended to return to the State in which the original warrant was issued within such time (whether more or less than one month after the making of the order) as he thinks fit.
485.	Forfeiture of recognisances
(1)	Where a person has, in pursuance of section 482, 483, or 484 of this Act, been admitted to bail in a State, and a magistrate for that State, or where the person was admitted to bail by a judge of the High Court of that State, a judge of that court, is satisfied that the person has failed to comply with the conditions of the recognisance upon which he was so admitted to bail, that magistrate or judge may declare the recognisance to be forfeited.
(2)	Where a recognisance is so declared to be forfeited, payment of any sum due under the recogni-sance by a person residing in the State in which the recognisance was declared to be forfeited may be enforced in the same manner as a recognisance entered into in that State in accordance with the provi-sions of Chapters 1 to 11 of this Act.
(3)	An amount recovered in pursuance of this section shall be transmitted to the principal officer of the Treasury of the State in which the original warrant was issued.
486.	Execution of distress warrants outside State of issue
(1)	Where a court of a State has in accordance with Chapters 1 to 11 of this Act issued a warrant of distress, a magistrate of another State, being a State in which any money or goods of the person against whom the warrant is issued are or are supposed to be, may, on being satisfied that the warrant was issued by the court, make an endorsement on the warrant in the form or to the effect of the form in the Fifth Schedule authorising its execution in that other State.
[Fifth Schedule.]
(2)	A warrant so endorsed may be executed by the same persons, in the same manner and to the same extent as a warrant of distress issued by the court by which it was endorsed. 
(3)	The amount recovered under a warrant endorsed, after deduction of the proper costs and charges of the execution and any sum payable to any person upon whose goods the distress was levied, shall be transmitted to the court by which the original warrant was issued.
