(3)	There shall be ascertained in respect of each brewing—
(a)	the quantity of worts of an original gravity of 1055 degrees which is the equivalent of the worts produced; and
(b)	the quantity of worts of that gravity deemed to have been brewed from the material used cal-culated in accordance with regulation 13 of these Regulations,

(5)	For the purpose of paragraph (3) (a) of this regulation, the equivalent therein mentioned shall be taken to be the quantity of the worts produced—
(a)	multiplied by the number less 1,000 of the degrees representing their original gravity; and
(b)	divided by 55.
[L.N. 160 of 1959.]
(6)	If, at any time while any worts are in the collecting or fermenting vessels at a brewery, the original gravity of the worts is found to exceed by five or more degrees the gravity recorded by the brewer in pursuance of regulation 5 of these Regulations or that ascertained by the proper officer, those worts may be deemed to be the produce of a fresh brewing and charged with duty accordingly.
(7)	Subject to paragraph (8) of this regulation, the amount payable in respect of duty shall become due immediately the worts are collected in a storage vessel already for bottling.
(8)	The Board may cause the charge to be made up at the close of each month in respect of all the brewing during that month and, in that case, the aggregate of the quantities of the worts deemed to have been brewed from the material used shall be treated as worts produced or deemed to have been brewed in one brewing, and the Board may, if it thinks fit, allow payment of the duty to be deferred upon such terms as it sees fit but so that the date of payment shall not be later than day twenty-one of the month next following that in which the duty was charged.
13.	Ascertainment of worts
(1)	For the purpose of ascertaining the quantity of worts of an original gravity of 1055 degrees deemed to have been brewed from the materials used, a brewer shall be deemed to have brewed 36 gallons of worts of the said gravity for every unit of materials recorded by him in pursuance of regulation 5 of these Regulations or used by him in any brewing.
(2)	For the purpose of paragraph (1) of this regulation, the expression 'unit of materials' means—
(a)	eighty-four pounds weight of malt or com of any description;
(b)	fifty-six pounds weight of sugar; or
(c)	a quantity of malt, com and sugar or any two of those materials, which by relation to sub- paragraphs (a) and (b) of this paragraph is the equivalent of either of the quantities mentioned in those paragraphs.
(3)	Where any materials used for brewing by the brewer are proved to the satisfaction of the Board to be of such description or nature that some deduction from the quantity deemed to have been brewed should be made, the Board shall make such a deduction from that quantity as will in its opinion afford just relief to the brewer.
(4)	In paragraph (2) of this regulation, the expression 'sugar' includes—
(a)	any saccharine substance, extract or syrup;
(b)	rice;
(c)	flaked maize and any other description of com which in the opinion of the Board is prepared in a manner similar to flaked maize;
