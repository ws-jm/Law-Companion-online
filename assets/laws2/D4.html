(b)	the inspection or testing, as the case may be, of ordinance and materiel;

(c)	such other duties as may be prescribed under this Act.

[Schedule.]

2.	Corporation to act under directions of Minister

(1)	The Minister may for all or any of the purposes of this Act initiate or approve policy; and accordingly the Minister may give to the Corporation directions of a general or special nature as to—

(a)	the manner in which the Corporation is to exercise its powers; or

(b)	the payment of allowances to members of the Corporation,

and it shall be the duty of the Corporation to give effect to any such directions.

(2)	No policy initiated by the Corporation shall be implemented without prior reference to an approval by the Minister, and the Minister may, if he thinks it necessary, consult with the Corporation before approving any policy, but the question whether there was any such consultation or what was decided shall not be inquired into by any court.

3.	Appointment and powers of Director-General

(1)	The Minister may from time to time appoint a military officer of the rank of Brigadier or above to be Director-General of the Corporation.

[No. 93 of 1979.]

(3)	The Director-General shall co-ordinate, harmonise and supervise the general planning of defence and allied industries which are set up to produce specifically or mainly for the armed forces in addition to encouraging other industries within the economy to produce for the general consumer as well as for the armed forces.

(4)	The Corporation may delegate to the Director-General all or any of the powers mentioned in this section and subject thereto the Director-General may authorise programmes and plans for giving effect to any policy approved by the Minister or to any direction or recommendation of the Corporation as to any ordnance factory in Nigeria or as to staff training therein.

(5)	The fact that any such powers have been delegated to the Director-General shall not preclude the Corporation itself from exercising them in any special case.

(6)	The powers mentioned in this section are—

(a)	the executive control over other servants of the Corporation;

(b)	the supervision of accounts and records;

(5)	Where any member of the civil service is seconded to the staff of the Corporation, he shall be notified of the terms and conditions thereof, and any such secondment shall be without prejudice to any pension rights, which, but for the secondment, would still accrue or become due, owing and payable to such public servant; and any person seconded to such staff may elect to be transferred to the staff, and any previous service in the civil service of the Federation shall count as service for the purposes of any pension subsequently payable.

(6)	Where any member of the civil service is transferred to the Corporation, his former service with the civil service of the Federation shall be taken into account when computing any requirements of the Pensions Act, and where the Federation Civil Service Commission approves, the said Commission shall do all things necessary and that Act shall be construed and have effect as if the service with the Corporation thereafter of the person so transferred were service with such civil service of the Federation.
