Evidence may be given in any suit or proceeding of the existence or non-existence of every fact in issue and of such other facts as are hereinafter declared to be relevant, and of no others:

8.	Facts which are the occasion, cause or effect of facts in issue

Facts which are the occasion, cause or effect, immediate or otherwise, of relevant facts or facts in issue, or which constitute the state of things under which they happened, or which afforded an opportu-nity for their occurrence or transaction, are relevant.

(3)	The word 'conduct' in this section does not include statements, unless those statements accom-pany and explain acts other than statements; but this provision shall not affect the relevancy of state-ments under any other section.

(4)	When the conduct of any person is relevant, any statement made to him or in his presence and hearing which affects such conduct is relevant.

10.	Facts necessary to explain or introduce relevant facts

Facts necessary to explain or introduce a fact in issue or relevant fact, or which support or rebut an inference suggested by a fact in issue or relevant fact, or which establish the identity of any thing or person whose identity is relevant, or fix the time or place at which any fact in issue or relevant fact happened, or which show the relation of parties by whom any such fact was transacted, are relevant in so far as they are necessary for the purpose.

11.	Things said or done by conspirator in reference to common intention

(1)	Where there is reasonable ground to believe that two or more persons have conspired together to commit an offence or actionable wrong, anything said, done or written by any one of such persons in execution or furtherance of their common intention, after the time when such intention was first enter-tained by any one of them, is a relevant fact as against each of the persons believed to be so conspiring, for the purpose of proving the existence of the conspiracy as well as for the purpose of showing that any such person was a party to it; but statements made by individual conspirators as to measures taken in the execution or furtherance of any such common intention are not deemed to be relevant as such as against any conspirators, except those by whom or in whose presence such statements are made.

(2)	Evidence of acts or statements deemed to be relevant under this section may not be given until the court is satisfied that, apart from them, there are prima facie grounds for believing in the existence of the conspiracy to which they relate.

In proceedings in which damages are claimed, any fact which will enable the court to determine the amount of damages which ought to be awarded is relevant.

14.	What customs admissible

(1)	A custom may be adopted as part of the law governing a particular set of circumstances if it can be noticed judicially or can be proved to exist by evidence; the burden of proving a custom shall lie upon the person alleging its existence.

(2)	A custom may be judicially noticed by the court if it has been acted upon by a court of superior or co-ordinate jurisdiction in the same area to an extent which justifies the court asked to apply it in assuming that the persons or the class of persons concerned in that area look upon the same as binding in relation to circumstances similar to those under consideration.

(3)	Where a custom cannot be established as one judicially noticed, it may be established and adopted as part of the law governing particular circumstances by calling evidence to show that persons or the class of persons concerned in the particular area regard the alleged custom as binding upon them:

Provided that in case of any custom relied upon in any judicial proceeding it shall not be enforced as law if it is contrary to public policy and is not in accordance with natural justice, equity and good conscience.

Every fact is deemed to be relevant which tends to show how in particular instances a matter alleged to be a custom was understood and acted upon by persons then interested.

16.	Facts showing existence of state of mind, or of body, or bodily feeling

(1)	Facts showing the existence of any state of mind, such as intention, knowledge, good faith, neg-ligence, rashness, ill-will or goodwill towards any particular person, or showing the existence of any state of body or bodily feeling, are relevant when the existence of any such state of mind or body or bodily feeling is in issue or relevant.

(2)	A fact relevant as showing the existence of a relevant state of mind must show that the state of mind exists, not generally, but in reference to the particular matter in question.*

17.	Facts bearing on question whether act was accidental or intentional

When there is a question whether an act was accidental or intentional, or done with a particular knowledge or intention, the fact that such act formed part of a series of similar occurrences, in each of which the person doing the act was concerned, is relevant.

18.	Existence of course of business when relevant

When there is a question whether a particular act was done, the existence of any course of business, according to which it naturally would have been done, is a relevant fact.

22.	Admissions by persons expressly referred to by party to suit

Statements made by persons to whom a party to the suit has expressly referred for information in reference to a matter in dispute, are admissions.

(a)	an admission may be proved by or on behalf of the person making it when it is of such a nature that, if the person making it were dead, it would be relevant as between third parties under section 33 of this Act;

(b)	an admission may be proved by or on behalf of the person making it, when it consists of a statement of the existence of any state of mind or body, relevant or in issue, made at or about the time when such state of mind or body existed, and is accompanied by conduct rendering its falsehood improbable; and

(c)	an admission may be proved by or on behalf of the person making it, if it is relevant otherwise than as an admission.

24.	When oral admissions as to contents of documents are relevant

25.	Admissions in civil cases when relevant

In civil cases, no admission is relevant if it is made either upon an express condition that evidence of it is not to be given, or in circumstances from which the court can infer that the parties agreed together that evidence of it should not be given:

Provided that nothing in this section shall be taken to exempt any legal practitioner from giving evidence of any matter of which he may be compelled to give evidence under section 170 of this Act.

(3)	Where more persons than one are charged jointly with a criminal offence and a confession made by one of such persons in the presence of one or more of the other persons so charged is given in evi-dence, the court, or a jury where the trial is one with a jury, shall not take such statement into consid-eration as against any of such other persons in whose presence it was made unless he adopted the said statement by words or conduct.

28.	Confession caused by inducement, threat or promise when irrelevant in criminal proceedings

A confession made by an accused person is irrelevant in a criminal proceeding, if the making of the confession appears to the court to have been caused by any inducement, threat or promise having refer-ence to the charge against the accused person, proceeding from a person in authority, and sufficient, in the opinion of the court, to give the accused person grounds which would appear to him reasonable for supposing that by making it he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature.

29.	Facts discovered in consequence of information given by accused

Where information is received from a person who is accused of an offence, whether such person is in custody or not, and as a consequence of such information any fact is discovered, the discovery of that fact, together with evidence that such discovery was made in consequence of the information received from the accused, may be given in evidence where such information itself would not be admissible in evidence.

30.	Confession made after removal of duress, relevant

If such a confession as is referred to in section 28 of this Act is made after the impression caused by any such inducement, threat or promise has, in the opinion of the court, been fully removed, it is relevant.

31.	Confession otherwise relevant not to become irrelevant because of promise of secrecy

If such a confession is otherwise relevant, it does not become irrelevant merely because it was made under a promise of secrecy, or in consequence of a deception practised on the accused person for the purpose of obtaining it, or when he was drunk, or because it was made in answer to questions which he need not have answered, whatever may have been the form of those questions, or because he was not warned that he was not bound to make such statement and that evidence of it might be given.

32.	Evidence in other proceedings amounting to a confession is admissible

Evidence amounting to a confession may be used as such against the person who gives it, although it was given upon oath, and although the proceeding in which it was given had reference to the same subject-matter as the proceeding in which it is to be proved, and although the witness might have refused to answer the questions put to him; but if, after refusing to answer any such question, the witness is improperly compelled to answer it, his answer is not a voluntary confession.

Statements by persons who cannot be called as witnesses

33.	Cases in which statement of relevant fact by person who is dead is relevant: dying declaration

(1)	Statements, written or verbal, or relevant facts made by a person who is dead, are themselves relevant facts in the following cases—

(a) 	when the statement is made by a person as to the cause of his death, or as to any of the cir-cumstances of the transaction which resulted in his death, in cases in which the cause of that person’s death comes into question; such statements are relevant only in trials for murder or manslaughter of the deceased person and only when such person at the time of making such declaration believed himself to be in danger of approaching death although he may have en-tertained at the time of making it hopes of recovery;

(b)	when the statement was made by such person in the ordinary course of business, and in particular when it consists of any entry or memorandum made by him in books kept in the ordinary course of business, or in the discharge of professional duty; or of an acknowledgement written or signed by him or the receipt of money, goods, securities or property of any kind; or of a document used in commerce written or signed by him; or of the date of a letter or other document usually dated, written or signed by him;

(c)	when the statement is against the pecuniary or proprietary interest of the person making it and the said person had peculiar means of knowing the matter and had no interest to misrepresent it;

(d)	when the statement gives the opinion of any such person, as to the existence of any public right or custom or matter of public or general interest, of the existence of which, if it existed, he would have been likely to be aware, and when such statement was made before any con-troversy as to such right, custom or matter had arisen;

(e)	subject to the conditions hereinafter mentioned, when the statement relates to the existence of any relationship by blood, marriage or adoption between persons as to whose relationship by blood, marriage or adoption the person making the statement had special means of knowledge.

(2)	The conditions above referred to are as follows—

(a)	such a statement is deemed to be relevant only in a case in which the pedigree to which it relates is in issue, and not to a case in which it is only relevant to the issue;

(b)	it must be made by a declarant shown to be related by blood to the person to whom it relates, or by the husband or wife of such a person; except that—

(i)	a declaration by a deceased parent that he or she did not marry the other parent until after the birth of a child is relevant to the question of the illegitimacy of such child upon any question arising as to the right of the child to inherit real or personal property under the Legitimacy Act; and

(ii)	in proceedings for the legitimacy of any person, a declaration made by a person who, if a decree of legitimacy were granted, would stand towards the petitioner in any of the relationships mentioned in paragraph (b) of this subsection, is deemed relevant to the question of the identity of the parents of the petitioner;

(c)	it must be made before the question in relation to which it is to be proved had arisen, but it does not cease to be deemed to be relevant because it was made for the purpose of preventing the question from arising.

Declarations by testators

(3)	(a) The declarations of a deceased testator as to his testamentary intentions, and as to the con-tents of his will, are deemed to be relevant—

(i)	when his will has been lost, and when there is a question as to what were its contents; or

(ii)	when the question is whether an existing will is genuine or was improperly obtained; or

(iii)	when the question is whether any and which of more existing documents than one con-stitute his will.

(b)	It is immaterial whether the declarations were made before or after the making or loss of

the will.

34.	Relevancy of certain evidence for proving, in subsequent proceeding, the truth of facts therein stated

(1)	Evidence given by a witness in a judicial proceeding, or before any person authorised by law to take it, is relevant for the purpose of proving, in a subsequent judicial proceeding, or in a later stage of the same judicial proceeding, the truth of the facts which it states, when the witness is dead or cannot be found, or is incapable of giving evidence, or is kept out of the way by the adverse party, or when his presence cannot be obtained without an amount of delay or expense which, in the circumstances of the case, the court considers unreasonable:

Provided—

(a)	that the proceeding was between the same parties or their representatives in interest;

(b)	that the adverse party in the first proceeding had the right and opportunity to cross-examine; and

(c)	that the questions in issue were substantially the same in the first as in the second proceeding.

(2)	A criminal trial or inquiry shall be deemed to be a proceeding between the prosecutor and the accused within the meaning of this section.

Absence of public officers

(3)	In the case of a person employed in the public service of the Federation or of a State who is re-quired to give evidence for any purpose connected with a judicial proceeding, it shall be sufficient to account for his non-attendance at the hearing of the said judicial proceedings if there is produced to the court, either a Federal Gazette, or a telegram or letter purporting to emanate from the head of his de-partment, sufficiently explaining to the satisfaction of the court his apparent default.

35.	When statement may be used in evidence

A statement in accordance with the provisions of sections 290 and 319 of the Criminal Procedure Act may afterwards be used in evidence on the trial of any person accused of an offence to which the same relates, if the person who made the statement be dead, or the court be satisfied that for any sufficient cause his attendance cannot be procured, and if reasonable notice of the intention to take such statement was served upon the person against whom it is to be read in evidence, and he had or might have had if he had chosen to be present full opportunity of cross-examining the person making the same.

[Cap. C41.]

36.	Admission of written statements of investigating police officers in certain cases

Notwithstanding the provisions of this Act or of any other law, but subject as herein provided, where in the course of any criminal trial, the court is satisfied that for any sufficient reason, the attendance of the investigating police officer cannot be procured, the written and signed statement of such officer may be admitted in evidence by the court if—

(a)	the defence does not object to the statement being admitted; and

(b)	the court consents to the admission of the statement.

37.	Statement of accused at preliminary investigation

Any statements made by an accused person at a preliminary investigation or at a coroner’s inquest may be given in evidence.

Statements made in special circumstances

38.	Entries in books of account, when relevant

Entries in books of account, regularly kept in the course of business, are relevant whenever they refer to a matter into which the court has to inquire, but such statements shall not alone be sufficient evidence to charge any person with liability. 

39.	Relevancy of entry in public records made in performance of duty

An entry in any public or other official book, register or record, stating a fact in issue or relevant fact and made by a public servant in the discharge of his official duty, or by any other person in performance of a duty specially enjoined by the law of the country in which such book, register or record is kept, is itself a relevant fact.

40.	Relevancy of statements in maps, charts and plans

Statements of facts in issue or relevant facts made in published maps or charts generally offered for public sale, or in maps or plans made under the authority of Government, as to matters usually represented or stated in such maps, charts or plans, are themselves relevant facts.

41.	Relevancy of statement as to fact of public nature contained in certain Acts or notifications

When the court has to form an opinion as to the existence of any fact of a public nature, any statement of it, made in a recital contained in any enactment or in any proclamation or speech of the President in opening the National Assembly or any legislation of the United Kingdom still applicable to Nigeria or in any proclamation or speech, or in any statement made in a Government or public notice appearing in the Federal Gazette or in a State notice or a State public notice appearing in a State Gazette or in any printed paper purporting to be the London Gazette or the Government Gazette of any part of the Commonwealth, is a relevant fact.

[Order 47 of 1951 and L.N. 112 of 1964.]

(1)	(a) Either party to the proceedings in any criminal case may produce a certificate signed by the Government chemist, the Deputy Government chemist, an Assistant Government chemist, a Government pathologist or entomologist, or the Accountant-General or any other chemist so specified by the Government chemist of the Federation or of the State, any pathologist or entomologist specified by the Director of Medical Laboratories of the Federation or of the State, or any accountant specified by the Accountant-General of the Federation or of the State (whether any such officer is by that or any other title in the service of a State or of the Federal Government), and the production of any such certificate may be taken as sufficient evidence of the facts stated therein:

Provided that, notwithstanding the provisions herein contained, the court shall have the power, on the application of either party or of its own motion, to direct that any such officer shall be summoned to give evidence before the court if it is of the opinion that, either for the purpose of cross-examination or for any other reason, the interests of justice so require.

[No. 52 of 1958 and L.N. 41 of 1934.]

Certificates of central bank officers as evidence in criminal cases

(b) Where a certificate purports to be signed by an officer of the Central Bank of Nigeria who himself adds after his signature the words 'duly authorised by the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria for the purposes of section 42 of the Evidence Act”, it shall be accepted by all courts and persons as sufficient evidence of the facts stated in the certificate, and no certificate shall be questioned on the ground only of the authorisation; but subject thereto, the proviso to subsection (1) (a) of this section shall have effect with regard to any such certificate.

(2)	Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1) of this section, any certificate issued and pro-duced by any officer in charge of any laboratory established by the appropriate authority, may be taken as sufficient evidence of the facts stated therein:

Provided that, notwithstanding the provisions herein contained, the court shall have the power, on the application of either party or of its own motion, to direct that any such officer shall be summoned to give evidence before the court if it is of the opinion that, either for the purpose of cross-examination or for any other reason, the interests of justice so require.

Provided that a certificate signed by such person shall not be admissible in evidence if, in the opinion of the court, it does not relate wholly or mainly to a subject so specified as aforesaid.

[No. 21 of 1955 and No. 52 of 1958.]

43.	Service of certificates on other party before hearing

Where the title to or interest in family or communal land is in issue, oral evidence of family or communal tradition concerning such title or interest is relevant.

46.	Acts of possession and enjoyment of land

47.	Evidence of scienter upon charge of receiving stolen property

(1)	Whenever any person is being proceeded against for receiving any property, knowing it to have been stolen, or for having in his possession stolen property, for the purpose of proving guilty knowledge, there may be given in evidence at any stage of the proceedings—

Judgments of courts ofjustice when relevant

49.	Previous judgments relevant to bar a second suit or trial

The existence of any judgment, order or decree which by law prevents any court from taking cogni-sance of a suit or holding a trial, is a relevant fact when the question is whether such court ought to take cognisance of such suit or to hold such trial.

50.	Relevancy of certain judgments in certain jurisdiction

(1)	A final judgment, order or decree of a competent court, in the exercise of probate, matrimonial, admiralty or insolvency jurisdiction, which confers upon or takes away from any person any legal char-acter, or which declares any person to be entitled to any such character, or to be entitled to any specific thing, not as against any specified person but absolutely, is relevant when the existence of any such legal character, or the title of any such persons to any such thing, is relevant.

(2)	Such judgment, order or decree is conclusive proof—

(a)	that any legal character which it confers accrued at the time when such judgment, order or decree came into operation;

(b)	that any legal character, to which it declares any such person to be entitled, accrued to that person at the time when such judgment, order or decree declares it to have accrued to that person;

(c)	that any legal character which it takes away from any such person ceased at the time from which such judgment, order or decree declared that it had ceased or should cease; and

(d)	that anything to which it declares any person to be so entitled was the property of that person at the time from which such judgment, order or decree declares that it had been or should be his property.

Judgments, orders or decrees, other than those mentioned in sections 49, 50 and 51 of this Act, are irrelevant, unless the existence of such judgment, order or decree is a fact in issue, or is relevant under some other provision of this or any other Act.

53.	Fraud or collusion in obtaining judgment, or incompetency of court, may be proved

Any party to a suit or other proceeding may show that any judgment, order or decree which is rele-vant under sections 49, 50 or 51 of this Act and which has been proved by the adverse party, was deliv-ered by a court without jurisdiction, or was obtained by fraud or collusion.

54.	Judgment conclusive of facts forming ground of judgment

Every judgment is conclusive proof, as against parties and privies, of facts directly in issue in the case, actually decided by the court, and appearing from the judgment itself to be the ground on which it was based; unless evidence was admitted in the action in which the judgment was delivered which is excluded in the action in which that judgment is intended to be proved.

55.	Effect of judgment not pleaded as estoppel

(1)	If a judgment is not pleaded by way of estoppel it is as between parties and privies deemed to be a relevant fact, whenever any matter, which was, or might have been, decided in the action in which it was given, is in issue, or is or is deemed to be relevant to the issue, in any subsequent proceeding.

(2)	Such a judgment is conclusive proof of the facts which it decides, or might have decided, if the party who gives evidence of it had no opportunity of pleading it as an estoppel.

56.	Judgment conclusive in favour of judge

When any action is brought against any person for anything done by him in a judicial capacity, the judgment delivered, and the proceedings, antecedent thereto, are conclusive proof of facts therein stated, whether they are or are not necessary to give the defendant jurisdiction, if, assuming them to be true, they show that he had jurisdiction.

Opinions of third persons when relevant

57.	Opinions of experts

(1)	When the court has to form an opinion upon a point of foreign law, native law or custom, or of science or art, or as to identity of handwriting or finger impressions, the opinions upon that point of persons specially skilled in such foreign law, native law or custom, or science or art, or in questions as to identity of handwriting or finger impressions, are relevant facts.

When the court has to form an opinion as to the relationship of one person to another, the opinion, expressed by conduct, as to the existence of such relationship, of any person who, as a member of the family or otherwise, has special means of knowledge on the subject, is a relevant fact:

Provided that such opinion shall not be sufficient to prove a marriage in proceedings for a divorce or in a petition for damages against an adulterer or in a prosecution for bigamy.

Admissibility of documentary evidence

91.	Admissibility of documentary evidence as to facts in issue

In any civil proceedings where direct oral evidence of a fact would be admissible, any statement made by a person in a document and tending to establish that fact, shall, on production of the original document, be admissible as evidence of that fact if the following conditions are satisfied—

(a)	if the maker of the statement either—

(i) had personal knowledge of the matters dealt with by the statement; or 

(ii)    where the document in question is or forms part of a record purporting to be a con-tinuous record, made the statement (in so far as the matters dealt with thereby are not within his personal knowledge) in the performance of a duty to record information supplied to him by a person who had, or might reasonably be supposed to have, per-sonal knowledge of those matters; and

(b) if the maker of the statement is called as witness in the proceedings:

Provided that the condition that the maker of the statement shall be called as a witness need not be satisfied if he is dead, or unfit by reason of his bodily or mental condition to attend as a witness, or if he is beyond the seas and it is not reasonably practicable to secure his attendance, or if all reasonable efforts to find him have been made without success.

(2)	In any civil proceedings, the court may at any stage of the proceedings, if having regard to all the circumstances of the case it is satisfied that undue delay or expense would otherwise be caused, order that such a statement as is mentioned in subsection (1) of this section shall be admissible as evidence or may, without any such order having been made, admit such a statement in evidence—

(a)	notwithstanding that the maker of the statement is available but is not called as a witness;

(b)	notwithstanding that the original document is not produced, if in lieu thereof there is produced a copy of the original document or of the material part thereof certified to be a true copy in such manner as may be specified in the order or as the court may approve, as the case may be.

(3)	Nothing in this section shall render admissible as evidence any statement made by a person in-terested at a time when proceedings were pending or anticipated involving a dispute as to any fact which the statement might tend to establish.

(4)	For the purposes of this section, a statement in a document shall not be deemed to have been made by a person unless the document or the material part thereof was written, made or produced by him with his own hand, or was signed or initialled by him or otherwise recognised by him in writing as one for the accuracy of which he is responsible.

(5)	For the purpose of deciding whether or not a statement is admissible as evidence by virtue of the foregoing provisions, the court may draw any reasonable inference from the form or contents of the document in which the statement is contained, or from any other circumstances, and may, in deciding whether or not a person is fit to attend as a witness, act on a certificate purporting to be the certificate of a registered medical practitioner, and where the proceedings are with a jury, the court may in its discretion reject the statement notwithstanding that the requirements of this section are satisfied with respect thereto, if for any reason it appears to it to be inexpedient in the interests of justice that the statement should be admitted.

92.	Weight to be attached to evidence

(1)	In estimating the weight, if any, to be attached to a statement rendered admissible as evidence by this Act, regard shall be had to all the circumstances from which any inference can reasonably be drawn as to the accuracy or otherwise of the statement, and in particular to the question whether or not the statement was made contemporaneously with the occurrence or existence of the facts stated, and to the question whether or not the maker of the statement had any incentive to conceal or misrepresent facts.

(2)	For the purpose of any rule of law or practice requiring evidence to be corroborated or regulating the manner in which uncorroborated evidence is to be treated, a statement rendered admissible as evidence by this Act, shall not be treated as corroboration of evidence given by the maker of the statement.

132.	Evidence of terms of judgments, contracts, grants and other dispositions of property reduced to a documentary form

(1) When any judgment of any court or any other judicial or official proceedings, or any contract, or any grant or other disposition of property has been reduced to the form of a document or series of documents, no evidence may be given of such judgment or proceedings, or of the terms of such contract, grant or disposition of property except the document itself, or secondary evidence of its contents in cases in which secondary evidence is admissible under the provisions hereinbefore contained; nor may the contents of any such document be contradicted, altered, added to or varied by oral evidence:

Provided that any of the following matters may be proved—

(a)	fraud, intimidation, illegality; want of due execution; the fact that it is wrongly dated; exis

tence, or want or failure, of consideration; mistake in fact or law; want of capacity in any contracting party, or the capacity in which a contracting party acted when it is not inconsistent with the terms of the contract; or any other matter which, if proved, would produce any effect upon the validity of any document, or of any part of it, or which would entitle any person to any judgment, decree, or order relating thereto;

(b)	the existence of any separate oral agreement as to any matter on which a document is silent, and which is not inconsistent with its terms, if from the circumstances of the case the court infers that the parties did not intend the document to be a complete and final statement of the whole of the transaction between them;

(c)	the existence of any separate oral agreement, constituting a condition precedent to the attach-ing of any obligation under any such contract, grant or disposition of property;

(d)	the existence of any distinct subsequent oral agreement to rescind or modify any such con-tract, grant or disposition of property;

(e)	any usage or custom by which incidents not expressly mentioned in any contract are annexed to contracts of that description; unless the annexing of such incident to such contract would be repugnant to or inconsistent with the express terms of the contract.

(2)	Oral evidence of a transaction is not excluded by the fact that a documentary memorandum of it was made, if such memorandum was not intended to have legal effect as a contract, grant or disposition of property.

(3)	Oral evidence of the existence of a legal relationship is not excluded by the fact that it has been created by a document, when the fact to be proved is the existence of the relationship itself, and not the terms on which it was established or is carried on.

133.	Evidence as to the interpretation of documents

(1)	Evidence may be given to show the meaning of illegible or not commonly intelligible characters of foreign, obsolete, technical, local and provincial expressions, of abbreviations and words used in a peculiar sense.

(2)	Evidence may not be given to show that common words, the meaning of which is plain, and which do not appear from the context to have been used in a peculiar sense, were in fact so used.

(3)	If the words of a document are so defective or ambiguous as to be unmeaning, no evidence can be given to show what the author of the document intended to say.

(4)	In order to ascertain the relation of the words of a document to facts, every fact may be proved to which it refers, or may probably have been intended to refer, or which identifies any person or thing mentioned in it. Such facts are hereinafter called the 'circumstances of the case”.

(5)	If the words of a document have a proper legal meaning, and also a less proper meaning, they must be deemed to have their proper legal meaning, unless such a construction would be unmeaning in reference to the circumstances of the case, in which case they may be interpreted according to their less proper meaning.

(6)	If the document has one distinct meaning in reference to the circumstances of the case, it must be construed accordingly, and evidence to show that the author intended to express some other meaning is not admissible.

(7)	If the documents applies in part but not with accuracy or not completely to the circumstances of the case, the court may draw inferences from those circumstances as to the meaning of the document, whether there is more than one, or only one thing or person to whom or to which the inaccurate descrip-tion may equally well apply and in such cases no evidence can be given of statements made by the author of the document as to his intentions in reference to the matter to which the document relates, though evidence may be given as to his circumstances, and as to his habitual use of language or names for particular persons or things.

(8)	If the language of the document, though plain in itself, applies equally well to more objects than one, evidence may be given both of the circumstances of the case and of statements made by any part to the document as to his intentions in reference to the matter to which the document relates.

(9)	If the document is of such a nature that the court will presume that it was executed with any other than its apparent intention, evidence may be given to show that it was in fact executed with its apparent intention.

134.	Application of this Part

(1)	Sections 132 and 133 of this Act apply only to parties to documents, and their representatives in interest, and only to cases in which some civil right or civil liability is dependent upon the terms of a document in question.

(2)	Any person other than a party to a document or his representative in interest may, notwithstand-ing the existence of any document, prove any fact which he is otherwise entitled to prove.

(3)	Any party to any document or any representative in interest of any such party may prove any such fact for any purpose other than that of varying or altering any right or liability depending upon the terms of the document.

(4)	Nothing in this Part contained shall be taken to affect any of the provisions of any enactment as to the construction of wills.

(1)	Whoever desires any court to give judgment as to any legal right or liability dependent on the existence of facts which he asserts, must prove that those facts exist.

(2)	When a person is bound to prove the existence of any fact, it is said that the burden of proof lies on that person.

The burden of proof in a suit or proceeding lies on that person who would fail if no evidence at all were given on either side.

137.	Burden of proof in civil cases

(1)	In civil cases the burden of first proving the existence or non-existence of a fact lies on the party against whom the judgment of the court would be given if no evidence were produced on either side, regard being had to any presumption that may arise on the pleadings.

(2)	If such party adduces evidence which ought reasonably to satisfy a jury that the fact sought to be proved is established, the burden lies on the party against whom judgment would be given if no more evidence were adduced; and so on successively, until all the issues in the pleadings have been dealt with.

(3)	Where there are conflicting presumptions, the case is the same as if there were conflicting evidence.

138.	Burden of proof beyond reasonable doubt

(1)	If the commission of a crime by a party to any proceeding is directly in issue in any proceeding civil or criminal, it must be proved beyond reasonable doubt.

(2)	The burden of proving that any person had been guilty of a crime or wrongful act is, subject to the provisions of section 141 of this Act, on the person who asserts it, whether the commission of such act is or is not directly in issue in the action.

(3)	If the prosecution prove the commission of a crime beyond reasonable doubt, the burden of proving reasonable doubt is shifted on to the accused.*

See section 141 (3). 

139.	Burden of proof as to particular fact

The burden of proof as to any particular fact lies on the person who wishes the court to believe in its existence, unless it is provided by any law that the proof of that fact shall lie on any particular person, but the burden may in course of a case be shifted from one side to the other; in considering the amount of evidence necessary to shift the burden of proof, regard shall be had by the court to the opportunity of knowledge with respect to the fact to be proved which may be possessed by the parties respectively.

140.	Burden of proving fact to be proved to make evidence admissible

(1)	The burden of proving any fact necessary to be proved in order—

(a)	to enable a person to adduce evidence of some other fact; or

[L.N. 46 of 1945.]

(2)	The burden of proof placed by this Part of this Act upon an accused charged with a criminal of-fence shall be deemed to be discharged if the court is satisfied by evidence given by the prosecution, whether on cross-examination or otherwise, that such circumstances in fact exist.

(3)	Nothing in sections 138 and 142 of this Act or in subsection (1) or (2) of this section shall—

(a)	prejudice or diminish in any respect the obligation to establish by evidence according to law any acts, omissions or intentions which are legally necessary to constitute the offence with which the person accused is charged; or

(b)	impose on the prosecution the burden of proving that the circumstances or facts described in subsection (2) of this section do not exist; or

(c)	affect the burden placed on an accused person to prove a defence of intoxication or insanity.

142.	Proof of facts especially within knowledge

When any fact is especially within the knowledge of any person, the burden of proving that fact is upon him.*

143.	Exceptions need not be proved by prosecution

Any exception, exemption, proviso, excuse, qualification, whether it does or does not accompany in the same section the description of the offence in the Act, order, By-law, regulation, or other document creating the offence, may be proved by the accused, but need not be specified or negatived in the charge, and, if so specified or negatived, no proof in relation to the matter so specified or negatived shall be required on the part of the prosecution.

See section 141 (3).

144.	Presumption of death from seven years9 absence and other facts

(1)	A person shown not to have been heard of for seven years by those, if any, who, if he had been alive, would naturally have heard of him, is presumed to be dead unless the circumstances of the case are such as to account for his not being heard of without assuming his death; but there is no presumption as to the time when he died, and the burden of proving his death at any particular time is upon the person who asserts it.

(2)	For the purpose of determining title to property where two or more persons have died in cir-cumstances in which it is uncertain which survived the other, they are presumed to have died in order of seniority.

(3)	There is no presumption as to the age at which a person died who is shown to have been alive at a given time.

145.	Burden of proof as to relationship in the case of partners, landlord and tenant, principal and agent

When the question is whether persons are partners, landlord and tenant, or principal and agent, and it has been shown that they have been acting as such, the burden of proving that they do not stand, or have ceased to stand, to each other in those relationships respectively, is on the person who affirms it.

146.	Burden of proof as to ownership

When the question is whether any person is owner of anything of which he is shown to be in posses-sion, the burden of proving that he is not the owner is on the person who affirms that he is not the owner.

147.	Proof of good faith in transactions where one party is in relation of active confidence

Where there is question as to the good faith of a transaction between parties, one of whom stands to the other in a position of active confidence, the burden of proving the good faith of the transaction is on the party who is in a position of active confidence.*

148.	Birth during marriage usually conclusive proof of legitimacy

Without prejudice to section 84 of the Matrimonial Causes Act, where a person was bom during the continuance of a valid marriage between his mother and any man, or within 280 days after dissolution, the mother remaining unmarried, the court shall presume that the person in question is the legitimate son of that man.

[Cap. M7.]

149.	Court may presume existence of certain facts

The court may presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being had to the common course of natural events, human conduct and public and private business, in their relation to the facts of the particular case, and in particular the court may presume—

(a)	that a man who is in possession of stolen goods soon after the theft is either the thief or has received the goods knowing them to be stolen, unless he can account for his possession;

(b)	that a thing or state of things which has been shown to be in existence within a period shorter than that within which such things or states of things usually cease to exist, is still in existence;

(c)	that the common course of business has been followed in particular cases;

See section 141 (3).

154.	Estoppel of person signing bill of lading

[Cap. 01.]

181.	Absence of religious belief does not invalidate oath

Where an oath has been duly administered and taken, the fact that the person to whom the same was administered had, at the time of taking such oath, no religious belief, does not for any purpose affect the validity of such oath.

(1)	Any court may on any occasion, if it thinks it just and expedient, receive the evidence, though not given upon oath, of any person declaring that the taking of any oath whatsoever is, according to his religious belief, unlawful or who, by reason of want of religious belief, ought not, in the opinion of the court, to be admitted to give evidence upon oath.

183.	Unsworn evidence of child

(1)	In any proceeding for any offence the evidence of any child who is tendered as a witness and does not, in the opinion of the court, understand the nature of an oath, may be received, though not given upon oath, if, in the opinion of the court, such child is possessed of sufficient intelligence to justify the reception of the evidence, and understands the duty of speaking the truth.

(2)	If the court is of opinion as stated in subsection (1) of this section, the deposition of a child may be taken, though not on oath, and shall be admissible in evidence in all proceedings where such deposi-tion if made by an adult would be admissible.

(3)	A person shall not be liable to be convicted of the offence unless the testimony admitted by virtue of this section and given on behalf of the prosecution is corroborated by some other material evidence in support thereof implicating the accused.

(4)	If any child whose evidence is received as aforesaid wilfully gives false evidence in such cir-cumstances that he would, if the evidence had been given on oath, have been guilty of perjury, he shall be guilty of an offence against section 191 of the Criminal Code Act and, on conviction, shall be dealt with accordingly.

[Cap. C38.]

184.	Evidence of first and second class chiefs

Where in any suit brought by or against a first or second class chief in either his official or personal capacity such chief desires to give evidence, or where in any other suit the evidence of such a chief is required, the evidence of the chief shall not be given at the hearing of the suit, but shall be taken in the form of a deposition or otherwise in accordance with the terms of an order to that effect to be made by the court, and the evidence so taken shall be admissible at the hearing if, when it was so taken, the other party to the suit had an opportunity of being present and of cross-examining:

Provided that the evidence of the chief shall be given at the hearing of the suit if he so desires, or if the court, having regard to all the circumstances, considers it to be necessary that his evidence should be so given and makes an order to that effect.

The examination of witnesses

185.	Order of production and examination of witnesses

The order in which witnesses are produced and examined shall be regulated by the law and practice for the time being relating to civil and criminal procedure respectively, and in the absence of any such law, by the discretion of the court.

186.	Judge to decide as to admissibility of evidence

(1)	When either party proposes to give evidence of any fact, the court may ask the party proposing to give the evidence in what manner the alleged fact, if proved, would be relevant; and the court shall admit the evidence if it thinks that the fact, if proved, would be relevant and not otherwise.

(2)	If the fact proposed to be proved is one of which evidence is admissible only upon proof of some other fact, such last mentioned fact must be proved before evidence is given of the fact first mentioned, unless the party undertakes to give proof of such fact, and the court is satisfied with such undertaking.

(3)	If the relevancy of one alleged fact depends upon another alleged fact being first proved, the court may, in its discretion, either permit evidence of the first fact to be given before the second fact is proved, or require evidence to be given of the second fact before evidence is given of the first fact.

187.	Ordering witnesses out of court

(1)	On the application of either party, or of its own motion, the court may order witnesses on both sides to be kept out of court; but this provision does not extend to the parties themselves or to their re-spective legal advisers, although intended to be called as witnesses.

Preventing communication with witnesses

(2)	The court may during any trial take such means as it considers necessary and proper for preventing communication with witnesses who are within the court house or its precincts awaiting examination.

188.	Examination-in-chief

(1)	The examination of a witness by the party who calls him shall be called his examination-in-chief.

Cross-examination

(2)	The examination of a witness by a party other than the party who calls him shall be called his cross-examination.

Re-examination

(3)	Where a witness has been cross-examined and is then examined by the party who called him, such examination shall be called his re-examination.

189.	Order of examinations

(1)	Witnesses shall be first examined-in-chief, then, if any other party so desires, cross-examined, then, if the party calling him so desires, re-examined.

(2)	The examination and cross-examination must relate to relevant facts, but the cross-examination need not be confined to the facts to which the witness testified on his examination-in-chief.

Direction of re-examination

(3)	The re-examination shall be directed to the explanation of matters referred to in cross- examination; and, if new matter is, by permission of the court, introduced in re-examination, the adverse party may further cross-examine upon that matter.

190.	Cross-examination by co-accused of prosecution witness

In criminal proceedings where more than one accused are charged at the same time, each accused shall be allowed to cross-examine a witness called by the prosecution before the witness is re-examined.

191.	Cross-examination by co-accused of witness called by an accused

Where more than one accused are charged at the same time, a witness called by one accused may be cross-examined by the other accused and if cross-examined by the other accused such cross- examination shall take place before cross-examination by the prosecution.

192.	Production of documents without giving evidence

Any person, whether a party or not, in a cause may be summoned to produce a document without being summoned to give evidence, and if he causes such document to be produced in court the court may dispense with his personal attendance. 

193.	Cross-examination of person called to produce a document

A person summoned to produce a document does not become a witness by the mere fact that he produces it and cannot be cross-examined unless and until he is called as a witness.

194.	Witnesses to character

Witnesses to character may be cross-examined and re-examined.

195.	Leading questions

Any question suggesting the answer which the person putting it wishes or expects to receive is called a leading question.

196.	When they must not be asked

(1)	Leading questions must not, if objected to by the adverse party, be asked in examination-inchief, or in re-examination, except with the permission of the court.

(2)	The court shall permit leading questions as to matters which are introductory or undisputed, or which have, in its opinion, been already sufficiently proved.

197.	When they may be asked

Leading questions may be asked in cross-examination.

198.	Evidence as to matters in writing

(1)	Any witness may be asked, whilst under examination, whether any contract, grant or other dis-position of property, as to which he is giving evidence, was not contained in a document, and if he says that it was, or if he is about to make any statement as to the contents of any document, which, in the opinion of the court, ought to be produced, the adverse party may object to such evidence being given until such document is produced, or until facts have been proved which entitle the party who called the witness to give secondary evidence of it.

(2)	A witness may however give oral evidence of statements made by other persons about the con-tents of a document if such statements are in themselves relevant facts.

199.	Cross-examination as to previous statements in writing

A witness may be cross-examined as to previous statements made by him in writing or reduced into writing, and relevant to matters in question in the suit or proceeding in which he is cross-examined without such writing being shown to him, or being proved; but, if it is intended to contradict him by the writing, his attention must, before the writing can be proved, called to those parts of it which are to be used for the purpose of contradicting him.

200.	Questions lawful in cross-examination

When a witness is cross-examined, he may, in addition to the questions hereinbefore referred to, be asked any questions which tend—

(a)	to test his accuracy, veracity or credibility; or

(b)	to discover who he is and what is his position in life; or

(c)	to shake his credit, by injuring his character:

Provided that a person charged with a criminal offence and being a witness may be cross- examined to the effect, and under the circumstances, described in the proviso to section 160 (d) of this Act.

201.	Court to decide whether question shall be asked and when witness compelled to answer

(1)	If any such question relates to a matter not relevant to the proceedings, except in so far as it affects the credit of the witness by injuring his character, the court shall decide whether or not the witness shall be compelled to answer it, and may, if it thinks fit, warn the witness that he is not obliged to answer it.

(2)	In exercising its discretion, the court shall have regard to the following considerations—

(a)	such questions are proper if they are of such a nature that the truth of the imputation con-veyed by them would seriously affect the opinion of the court as to the credibility of the wit-ness on the matter to which he testifies;

(b)	such questions are improper if the imputation which they convey relates to matters so remote in time, or of such a character, that the truth of the imputation would not affect, or would affect in a slight degree, the opinion of the court as to the credibility of the witness on the matter to which he testifies;

(c)	such questions are improper if there is a great disproportion between the importance of the imputation made against the witness’s character and the importance of his evidence.

(3)	The court may, if it sees fit, draw, from the witness’s refusal to answer, the inference that the answer if given would be unfavourable.

202.	Question not to be asked without reasonable grounds

No such question as is referred to in section 201 of this Act ought to be asked, unless the person asking it has reasonable grounds for thinking that the imputation which it conveys is well founded.

203.	Procedure of court in case of question being asked without reasonable grounds

If the court is of opinion that any such question was asked without reasonable grounds, it may, if it was asked by any legal practitioner, report the circumstances of the case to the Attorney-General of the Federation or other authority to which such legal practitioner is subject in the exercise of his profession.

[L.N. 131 of 1964.]

204.	Indecent and scandalous questions

The court may forbid any questions or inquiries which it regards as indecent or scandalous, although such questions or inquiries may have some bearing on the questions before the court, unless they relate to facts in issue, or to matters necessary to be known in order to determine whether or not the facts in issue existed.

205.	Questions intended to insult or annoy

The court shall forbid any question which appears to it to be intended to insult or annoy, or which, though proper in itself, appears to the court needlessly offensive in form.

206.	Exclusion of evidence to contradict answers to questions testing veracity

When a witness has been asked and has answered any question which is relevant to the inquiry only in so far as it tends to shake his credit by injuring his character, no evidence shall be given to contradict him; but, if he answers falsely, he may afterwards be charged with an offence against section 191 of the Criminal Code Act and, on conviction, shall be dealt with accordingly:

Provided that—

(a) 	if a witness is asked whether he has been previously convicted of any crime and denies it, evidence may be given of his previous conviction;

(b)	if a witness is asked any question tending to impeach his impartiality and answers it by deny

ing the facts suggested he may be contradicted.

[Cap. C38.]

207.	How far a party may discredit his own witness

The party producing a witness shall not be allowed to impeach his credit by general evidence of bad character, but he may, in case the witness shall, in the opinion of the court, prove hostile, contradict him by other evidence, or by leave of the court, prove that he has made at other times a statement inconsistent with his present testimony; but before such last mentioned proof can be given the circumstances of the supposed statement, sufficient to designate the particular occasion, must be mentioned to the witness and he must be asked whether or not he has made such statement.

208.	Proof of contradictory statement of hostile witness

If a witness upon cross-examination as to a former statement made by him relative to the subject- matter of the trial, and inconsistent with his present testimony, does not distinctly admit that he has made such statement, proof may be given that he did in fact make it; but before such proof can be given the circumstances of the supposed statement sufficient to designate the particular occasion must be mentioned to the witness, and he must be asked whether or not he has made such statement.

209.	Cross-examination as to previous statements in writing

A witness may be cross-examined as to previous statements made by him in writing relative to the subject-matter of the trial without such writing being shown to him, but if it is intended to contradict such witness by the writing, his attention must, before such contradictory proof can be given, be called to those parts of the writing which are to be used for the purpose of so contradicting him:

Provided always that it shall be competent for the court at any time during the trial, to require the production of the writing for its inspection, and the court may thereupon make use of it for the purposes of the trial, as it shall think fit.

210.	Impeaching credit of witness

The credit of a witness may be impeached in the following ways by any party other than the party calling him or with the consent of the court by the party who calls him—

(a)	by the evidence of persons who testify that they, from their knowledge of the witness, believe him to be unworthy of credit;

(b)	by proof that the witness has been bribed, or has accepted the offer of a bribe, or has received any other corrupt inducement to give his evidence;

(c)	by proof of former statements inconsistent with any part of his evidence which is liable to be contradicted.

211.	Cross-examination of prosecutrix in certain cases

When a man is prosecuted for rape or for attempt to commit rape or for indecent assault, it may be shown that the woman against whom the offence is alleged to have been committed was of a generally immoral character, although she is not cross-examined on the subject; the woman may in such a case be asked whether she has had connection with other men, but her answer cannot be contradicted and she may also be asked whether she has had connection on other occasions with the prisoner, and if she de-nies it she may be contradicted.

See section 225.

212.	Evidence of witness impeaching credit

A witness declaring another witness to be unworthy of credit may not, upon his examination-inchief, give reasons for his belief, but he may be asked his reasons in cross-examination, and the answers which he gives cannot be contradicted, though, if they are false, he may afterwards be charged with an offence against section 191 of the Criminal Code Act and, on conviction, shall be dealt with accordingly.

[Cap. C38J

213.	Questions tending to corroborate evidence of relevant fact, admissible

When a witness whom it is intended to corroborate gives evidence of any relevant fact, he may be questioned as to any other circumstances which he observed at or near to the time or place at which such relevant fact occurred, if the court is of opinion that such circumstances, if proved, would corroborate the testimony of the witness as to the relevant fact which he testifies.

214.	Former statements of witness may be proved to corroborate later testimony as to same fact

In order to corroborate the testimony of a witness, any former statement made by such witness relat-ing to the same fact at or about the time when the fact took place, or before any authority legally com-petent to investigate the fact, may be proved.

215.	What matters may be proved in connection with proved statement relevant under section 33 or 34

Whenever any statement relevant under section 33 or 34 of this Act is proved, all matters may be proved either in order to contradict or to corroborate it, or in order to impeach or confirm the credit of the person by whom it was made, which might have been proved if that person had been called as a witness and had denied upon cross-examination the truth of the matters suggested.

216.	Refreshing memory

(1)	A witness may, while under examination, refresh his memory by referring to any writing made by himself at the time of the transaction concerning which he is questioned, or so soon afterwards that the court considers it likely that the transaction was at the time fresh in his memory.

(2)	The witness may also refer to any such writing made by any other person, and read by the wit-ness within the time aforesaid, if when he read it he knew it to be correct.

(3)	An expert may refresh his memory by reference to professional treatises.

217.	Testimony to facts stated in document mentioned in section 216

A witness may also testify to facts mentioned in any such document as is mentioned in section 216, although he has no specific recollection of the facts themselves, if he is sure that the facts were correctly recorded in the document.

218.	Right of adverse party as to writing used to refresh memory

Any writing referred to under the provisions of the two last preceding sections must be produced and shown to the adverse party if he requires it: such party may, if he pleases, cross-examine the witness thereupon.

219.	Production of documents

(1) A witness, subject to the provisions of section 220 of this Act, summoned to produce a document shall, if it is in his possession or power, bring it to court, notwithstanding any objection which there may be to its production or to its admissibility and the validity of any such objection shall be decided by the court. 

Inspection of documents

(2) The court, if it sees fit, may inspect the document or take other evidence to enable it to determine on its admissibility.

Translation of documents

(3)	If for such a purpose, it is necessary to cause any document to be translated, the court may, if it thinks fit, direct the translator to keep the contents secret, unless the document is to be given in evidence and, if the translator disobeys such direction, he shall be held to have committed an offence under section 97 (1) of the Criminal Code Act.

[Cap. C38J

220.	Exclusion of evidence on grounds of public interest

(1)	The Minister, or in respect of matters to which the executive authority of a State extends, the Governor or any person nominated by him, may in any proceedings object to the production of documents or request the exclusion of oral evidence, when, after consideration, he is satisfied that the production of such document or the giving of such oral evidence is against public interest; and any such objection taken before trial shall be by affidavit and any such objection taken at the hearing shall be by certificate produced by a public officer.

[L.N. 131 of 1954 and L.N. 20 of 1957.]

(2)	Any such objection, whether by affidavit sworn by the Minister or by certificate under his hand (or by affidavit sworn by or certificate under the hand of the Governor or person nominated by him as aforesaid), shall be conclusive and the court shall not inspect such documents or be informed as to the nature of such oral evidence but shall give effect to such affidavit or certificate.

[L.N. 131 of 1954 and L.N. 120 of 1957.]

221.	Giving as evidence of document called for and produced on notice

When a party calls for a document which he has given the other party notice to produce, and such document is produced and inspected by the party calling for its production, he is bound to give it as evidence if the party producing it requires him to do so.

222.	Using, as evidence, of document production of which was refused on notice

When a party refuses to produce a document which he has had notice to produce, he cannot after-wards use the document as evidence without the consent of the other party or the order of the court.

223.	Judge’s power to put questions or order production

The court or any person empowered by law to take evidence may, in order to discover or to obtain proper proof of relevant facts, ask any question he pleases, in any form, at any time, of any witness, or of the parties about any fact relevant or irrelevant; and may order the production of any document or thing; and neither the parties nor their agents shall be entitled to make any objection to any such question or order or, without the leave of the court, to cross-examine any witness upon any answer given in reply to any such question:

Provided that the judgment must be based upon facts declared by this Act to be relevant, and duly proved:

Provided further that this section shall not authorise any judge to compel any witness to answer any question or to produce any document which such witness would be entitled to refuse to answer or produce under sections 162 to 176 of this Act, if the question were asked or the document were called for by the adverse party; nor shall the judge ask any question which it would be improper for any other person to ask under section 201 or 202 of this Act, nor shall he dispense with primary evidence of any document, except in the cases hereinbefore excepted.

224.	Power of jury or assessors to put questions

In cases tried by jury or with assessors, the jury or assessors may put any questions to the witnesses, through or by leave of the judge, which the judge himself might put and which he considers proper.
