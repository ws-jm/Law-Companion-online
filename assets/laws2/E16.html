[No. 22 of 1964.]

[Date of commencement: 1st April, 1964]

1.	Distiller’s licence

(1)	Subject to the provisions of this Act, no person shall without a distiller’s licence under this sec-tion make or distill spirits; and application for such licence shall be made to the Board of Customs and Excise in the prescribed manner.

[L.N. 118 of 1964 and No. 27 of 1965.]

(2)	If the Board after due enquiry is satisfied that the premises mentioned in the application and in-tended to be used by the applicant for the purposes of distillation are in such a state that proper control for excise purposes may be exercised over activities to be carried on therein and that any other condition relating to the premises required by the Board has been complied with by the applicant, it shall, on payment of the sum of two hundred naira issue to the applicant a distiller’s licence in the prescribed form in respect of such premises.

(3)	A distiller’s licence issued under this section shall, unless previously revoked, remain in force until 31 December next following the date of the issue, and shall then expire.

(4)	If the Board is not so satisfied and refuses the application it shall notify the applicant of its re-fusal, and give to the applicant particulars of what the Board considers necessary to be done to the premises.

(5)	If at anytime during the currency of a distiller’s licence the Board is satisfied that proper control for excise purposes can no longer be exercised over the premises specified in the distiller’s licence by reason of the state of the premises, or that the person to whom such licence was issued has failed to comply with any conditions required by the Board relating to the premises or the making or distilling of spirits therein or has ceased to make spirits on such premises, it may revoke the distiller’s licence and give notice of the revocation in the prescribed manner.

(6)	Any person who makes or distils spirits contrary to the provisions of subsection (1) of this section shall be guilty of an offence, and liable—

(a)	on summary conviction to a fine of not less than four hundred naira or more than one thousand naira or to imprisonment for a term of two years, or to both;

(b)	on conviction on indictment to a fine of an unlimited amount or to imprisonment for a term

not exceeding five years or to both,

and any spirits so distilled shall be liable to forfeiture.

(7)	The provisions of this section shall, in any State or the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja be in addition to and not in substitution for any other provisions in force therein which affect the making of

spirits,	and nothing in the foregoing provisions of this section shall be construed	as	purporting	to

authorise	the carrying on in any State or the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja of any	activity	which	is

prohibited by the law thereof.

2.	Still licence

(1)	Subject to the provisions of this section, no person shall posses any still unless—

(a)	the still is situated on premises specified in a distiller’s licence; or

(b)	there is in force a still licence issued to him by the Board under this section.

(2)	Where an application is made to the Board in the prescribed manner for the issue of a still licence, and the Board is satisfied, it shall issue the licence to the applicant free of charge.

(3)	A licence under subsection (2) of this section may be issued subject to such conditions not in-consistent with this Act as to methylation or the denaturing of spirits as the Board for the protection of excise duty may think fit.

(4)	If a person gives notice to the Board in the prescribed form of his intention to part with or that he has parted with possession of, or has destroyed any still in respect of which a licence issued to him under this section is in force, the Board shall make such enquiries as it thinks fit; and if it is satisfied, the licence shall cease to have effect as regards the still.

(a)	on summary conviction, to a fine of not less than four hundred naira or to imprisonment for a term of six months, or to both;

A distiller shall not have in his possession any wort or wash the original gravity of which, as ascer-tained from any sample thereof taken from a fermenting vessel or wash charger, differs by more than two degrees from the original gravity thereof as declared by him.

D.	Charge of excise duty on spirits, etc.

22.	Ascertainment of strength of spirits

(1)	The strength of spirits shall be ascertained by means of Tralles’ Alcoholometer and its associated table as deposited by the Board with the Federal Government Chemist.

[L.N. 80 of 1968.]

(2)	The strength of spirits shall be taken to be the percentage by volume of pure alcohol contained in those spirits determined at a temperature of fifteen point five six degrees Centigrade or sixty degrees Fahrenheit.

(3)	Where the indicated strength at any given temperature on the Tralles’ Alcoholometer falls be-tween two consecutive numbers appearing in the table, a proportionate adjustment shall be added to the lesser of the two numbers and the amount so determined shall be deemed to be the strength of the spirits.

(4)	Where the spirits contain any substance other than ethyl alcohol and water, the Board may, if it sees fit, either—

(a)	cause to be removed from the spirits any such substance to the extent which it considers nec-essary by distillation or such other process as it may direct and may, after the addition of water to replace the quantity so removed, ascertain the strength of the spirits by means authorised by this Regulation; or

(b)	treat the spirits as though they contain ethyl alcohol and water only.

23.	Charge of excise duty

Excise duty, at the rate prescribed in the Customs, Excise Tariff, etc. (Consolidation) Act shall be charged on the actual quantity of spirits produced, but where that quantity is less than the quantity of spirits capable of being produced from the materials used, calculated in accordance with regulation 24 of these Regulations, on the higher quantity; and the said duty shall be payable at the time the spirits are finally collected unless the spirits are—

(a)	transferred immediately to an approved bonded warehouse; or

(b)	removed for an approved use or purpose, without payment of duty; or

(c)	subjected to a denaturing process approved by the Board.

[Cap. C49 and L.N. 80 of 1968.]

24.	Duty on spirits by attenuation charge

Where spirits are manufactured by distillation of a fermented liquor, the quantity of spirits deemed to be manufactured from the materials used shall be calculated in respect of each distillation period in accordance with the following provisions of this Regulation—

(a) there shall be calculated the quantity of spirits of the strength of fifty per cent by volume of pure alcohol capable of being produced from any wort and wash made at the distillery on the assumption that from every one hundred gallons of wort and wash, one gallon of spirits at the strength of fifty per cent by volume of pure alcohol will be produced for every five degree of difference between the highest gravity of the wort and the lowest gravity of the wash before distillation, and so in proportion for any less number of gallons of wort and wash and any less number of degrees of attenuation;

(b)	the gravity of wort or wash for the purposes of paragraph (a) of this Regulation, shall be taken as that declared by the distiller; provided that if either gravity is found by the proper officer before distillation and the gravity so found is, in the case of wort, higher or, in the case of wash, lower than that declared by the distiller, the gravity to be taken shall be that so found by the proper officer;

(c)	there shall be ascertained the quantity of spirits and feints computed at the strength of fifty per cent by volume of pure alcohol produced at the distillery after deducting the feints remaining at the end of the last preceding distillation period;

(d)	if the quantity calculated under paragraph (a) of this Regulation exceeds the quantity ascer-tained under paragraph (c) of this Regulation, the excise duty on spirits shall be charged and become payable immediately on the excess:

Provided that the Board may make such allowance as in its opinion is reasonable from any charge under this Regulation on proof to its satisfaction that the charge arises wholly or in part on account of the removal of wort for the separation of yeast or on account of the loss or destruction of wort or wash by unavoidable accident.

25.	Disposal of feints

(1)	Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2 of this Regulation as to feints remaining from a previous distillation, or as may be approved in any case, a distiller shall keep all the produce of a period unmixed with any other matter and separate from all other produce until account has been taken by the proper officer.

(2)	Any feints produced by and remaining from a previous distillation may be mixed with the low wines or feints produced by a subsequent distillation and the process of re-distilling feints may be re-peated as often as the distiller thinks fit.

26.	Notice to remove feints

Not less than four hours before the removal of any low wines or feints from a receiver, a distiller shall give to the proper officer written notice specifying the date and hour of intended removal, and immediately after the officer has taken account of the contents of the receiver they shall be removed forthwith into the proper charger:

Provided that where the distiller has secured his low wines and feints pumps to the satisfaction of the Board, he may at any time, without notice, remove low wines and feints from the receiver to a charger and re-distil them.

27.	Return of materials and spirits produced

At the end of each period the distiller shall sign and deliver to the proper officer a return, in duplicate, in an approved form specifying—

(a)	the quantity of each description of material used in the making of wort or wash during the period;

(b)	the quantity of wort or wash decreased or distilled during the period;

(c)	the quantity of spirits computed at the strength of fifty per cent of pure alcohol as ascertained by Tralles’ Alcoholometer produced during the period;

(d)	the quantity of feints remaining at the end of the period. 

28.	Drawing off water from worm, etc.

At any time when distillation is not in progress, the distiller shall, if so required by the proper officer, draw off water from the worm tubs or refrigerators, and these vessels shall remain empty until the officer completes his examination of the spirit pipes therein.

E.	Warehousing of spirits

29.	Warehousing of spirits

(1)	Not less than four hours before he intends to warehouse any spirits, a distiller shall give a written notice to the proper officer to take account of such spirits, specifying the day and hour of intended warehousing and the vessel in which the spirits are contained.

(2)	When such spirits are contained in a spirit receiver which is not also entered as a warehouse vat, the distiller shall remove them to the distiller’s warehouse immediately after the account has been taken by the officer.

(3)	When such spirits are contained in a receiver which is also entered as a warehouse vat, they shall be deemed to be warehoused immediately the account has been taken by the officer.

(4)	The quantity found in the spirit receiver shall in all cases be deemed to be the quantity warehoused.

(5)	All the spirits produced in a period shall be warehoused within ten days from the end of that period.

30.	Spirits which may be deposited in a distiller’s warehouse

Save as permitted by the Board, and subject to such conditions as from time to time it sees fit to im-pose, a distiller shall not deposit any spirits in his distiller’s warehouse other than spirits manufactured in the distillery to which the warehouse is attached.
