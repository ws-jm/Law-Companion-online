Division One - General

1.	Application; enforcement and exemptions from regulations

These Regulations shall apply to all electrical installations connected to any source of electrical energy operated under the authority of a licence granted under the Electricity Act (and whether granted before or after the coming into force of these Regulations), and to all electrical installations for the installing of which such a licence is required (and whether granted before or after the coming into force of these Regulations), but save as provided in the Electricity Supply Regulations nothing herein shall apply to any generating plant which is subject to these Regulations.

2.

(1)	It shall be a condition of every licence grated under the Electricity Act (and whether granted before or after the coming into force of these Regulations) by which any electricity supply authority is empowered to connect with such line any new installation on the consumer’s premises unless and until such installation has been inspected, tested, and certified pursuant to these Regulations.

(2)	It shall also be a condition of every such licence that the electricity supply authority shall not supply electrical energy to any installation connected with the supply authority’s electric lines, or to supply electrical energy to any other existing installation if such installation or any part thereof is not reasonably free form electrical hazard, and such work in accordance with these Regulations as such electricity supply authority directs is not done to render such installation or such part reasonably so free: provided that it shall not be necessary for the supply authority to require strict compliance with these Regulations in the doing of any such work if it is satisfied that such compliance would involve unreasonable expenditure and that the installation can otherwise be rendered reasonably free from elec-trical hazard.

(3)	It shall not be necessary until six months after the commencement of these Regulations for the supply authority to insist on the use of any material necessary to make any installation comply with the requirement of these Regulations if such materials are not in general use or are not readily procurable in Nigeria.

3.

In any case where the electricity supply authority is also a consumer of the electrical energy supplied by it, the conditions imposed by the last preceding regulation shall apply to it in its capacity as supply authority as if it were supplying electricity to some other consumer than itself, but in such case the Director of Electrical Inspectorate Services or some person appointed by him in writing in that behalf shall have and may exercise the power mentioned in regulation 2 (1) to inspect, test and certify.

4.

Where a supply authority changes over from one voltage or system to another the Director of Electrical Inspectorate Services may, by notice published in the Gazette, make such modification as may be specified in such notice of these Regulations in their application to the reconditioning of installations for the purposes of such change-over.

5.

The Director of Electrical Inspectorate Services may from time to time, by notice in the Gazette, approve methods or types of construction or materials not specially provided for in these Regulations, and impose such conditions as he deems necessary with respect to the use thereof.

6.

(1)	In any case where the Director of Electrical Inspectorate Services upon application being made to him in writing by any person proposing to make any new installation, is satisfied that strict compliance with these Regulations would involve expenditure out of proportion to the degree of freedom from electrical hazard to be secured by such compliance, he may modify any such requirements if satisfied that reasonable freedom from electrical hazard can be otherwise secured.

(2)	Every such application shall be accompanied by a full statement of the reasons why such modi-fication is desired and of the nature thereof, and by a certificate by the supply authority’s engineer that the application is a reasonable one and that in his opinion such modification will not lead to serious increase in the electrical hazard.

(3)	In granting any such modification the Director of Electrical Inspectorate Services shall specify what special work (if any) he requires to be done to render the installation reasonably free from electrical hazard.

PART II

Permits for electrical installation

7.

Save as provided in regulations 9 and 10 hereof, no electrical installation shall be commenced until a written permit therefor has been obtained from the electricity supply authority.

8.

(1)	A supply authority may grant permits for temporary installations—

(i)	no permits for temporary installations shall be granted for any longer period than one month after the date on which such installation is connected to the source of supply.

(2)	On the expiration of the period for which a permit for a temporary installation is granted a further such permit may be granted for a period not exceeding one month, but the total period during which a temporary installation may be connected to the source of supply under the authority of successive permits shall not exceed six months from the date on which it was first connected.

9.

In any case of emergency due to a breakdown or other accident any authorised person may, without obtaining a permit as required by these Regulations, begin any work necessary to repair the installation, but application for such permit must be made to the supply authority within twenty-four hours after such work is begun. 

10.

In any case where an electricity supply authority is also the consumer of the electrical energy supplied by it, or is the contractor for any electrical installation work, the Director of Electrical Inspectorate Services or any person authorised by him in writing in that behalf shall exercise and perform the powers, functions, and duties conferred or imposed on the electricity supply authority as such by the foregoing provisions of this Part of these Regulations.

(2)	Aluminium-sheathed cables installed in underground pipes or in concrete ducts shall be provided with a corrosion-resistant finish.

47.	Segregation of circuits

Where an installation comprises extra low-voltage or telecommunication or fire-alarm circuits, as well as circuits operating at low voltage and connected directly to a mains supply system, precautions shall be taken to prevent electrical contact between the cables of the various types of circuit.

48.

(1) Types of circuit described in these Regulations are divided into categories as follows—

(a)	Category I circuits.—circuits (other than fire alarm circuits) operating at low voltage and supplied directly from a mains supply system. 

(b)	Category II circuits.—with the expectation of fire-alarm circuits all extra low-voltage circuits; and telecommunication circuits (e.g. radio, telephone, sound-distribution, burglar-alarm, bell and call circuits) which are not supplied directly from a mains supply system.

(c)	Category III circuits.—fire-alarm circuits.

(2)	Cables of Category I circuits shall not be drawn into the same conduit or duct as cables of Cate-gory II circuits, unless the latter cables are insulated in accordance with the requirements of these Regula-tions for the highest voltage present in the Category I circuits.

(3)	Cables of Category I circuits shall not in any circumstance be drawn into the same conduit or duct as cables of Category III circuits.

49A.

Where a common channel or trunking is used to contain cables of Category I and Category III circuits, the two Categories of circuits shall be separated by continuous partitions of fire-resisting material; provided that this requirement shall not apply where the Category III circuits are wired in mineral-insulated metal-sheathed cable.

(2)	In conduit, duct, or trunking systems, where controls or outlets for Category I and Category II circuits are mounted in or on common boxes, switch-plates or blocks, the cables and connections of the two Categories of circuits shall be partitioned by means of rigid fixed screens or barriers. At any common outlets in a trunking system for Category I and Category III circuits, the two categories of circuits shall be separated by continuous partitious of fire-resisting material.

(3)	Where cores of Category I and Category II circuits are contained in a common multi-core cable, flexible cable or flexible cord, the cores of the Category II circuits shall be insulated individually or collectively as a group, in accordance with the requirements of these Regulations, for the highest voltage present in the Category I circuits, or alternatively shall be separated from the cores of the Category I circuits by an earthed metal braid of equivalent current-carrying capacity to that of the cores of the Category I circuits. Where terminations of the two categories of circuits are mounted in or on common boxes, switch-plates or blocks, they shall be partitioned in accordance with regulations or alternatively be mounted on separated and distinct terminal blocks adequately marked to indicate their functions.

(4)	Cores of Category I and Category III circuits shall not in any circumstances be contained in a common multi-core cable, flexible cable or flexible cord.

(5)	Metal sheaths and armour of all cables operating at low voltage, and metal conduits, ducts and trunking and bare earth-continuity conductors associated with such cables, which might otherwise come into fortuitous contact with other fixed metalwork shall be either effectually segregated therefrom, or effectually bonded thereto so as to prevent appreciable voltage differences at such possible points of contact. Electrical services shall not be installed in the same conduit or trunking as pipes or tubes of non-electrical services e.g. air, gas, oil or water.

PART XV

Electric discharge and fluorescent light circuits and signs

271.	Switches

Every switch not specifically designed to break an inductive load of its full rated capacity shall, if used to control a discharged lighting circuit, have a current rating of not less than twice the total steady current which it is required to carry or, if used to control filament lighting and discharge lighting, have a current rating of not less than the sum of the current flowing in the filament lamps, and twice the total steady current flowing in the electric discharge lamps.

272.	Circuit loading

Circuits shall be capable of carrying the total steady current viz that of the lamp(s) and any associated gear and also their harmonic currents. Where more exact information is not available, the demand in volt-amperes may be taken for the purpose of this Regulation as the rated lamp watts multiplied by not less than 1.8. The neutral conductor in every discharge-lighting circuit shall have a cross-sectional area not less than that of the phase conductor(s).

NOTE.—The multiplier referred to in regulation 272 is based on the assumption that a circuit is corrected to a power factor of not less than 0.85 lagging, and takes into account controlgear losses and harmonic currents.

273.	Transformer and inductors

Every inductor and high-reactance transformer shall be installed as near as is practicable to its asso-ciated electric discharge lamp.

274.	Screening

All live parts, including all apparatus and conductors but excluding the lamps except in the neighbourhood of their terminal, shall be provided with effective screens of earthed metal or insulating material, of mechanical strength adequate to withstand the conditions of normal service, or alternatively for installations on the exterior of a building, such live parts may be so situated as to be accessible only to authorised persons. Screens of insulating materials used for this purpose shall be non-hygroscopic anti-tracking, and substantially non-combustible.

275.	Motor-generators and converters

Every circuit which is energised by a motor generator or double wound converter shall be permanently earthed at a terminal of the motor-generator converter.

276.	Maximum permissible voltage

No circuit shall use a voltage exceeding 5 kilovolts r.m.s. to earth, measured on open circuit.

277.	Transformers of input exceeding 500W

Every circuit at a voltage exceeding low voltage supplied from a transformer having a rated input exceeding 500 watts shall be provided with means for the automatic disconnection of the supply in the event of a short circuit on an earth-leakage current which exceeds twenty per cent of the normal steady current in the circuit.

278.	Ancillary requirement

Ancillary equipment for installations at voltages exceeding low voltages, including inductors, ca-pacitors, resistors, and transformers shall be either totally enclosed in a substantial, earthed, metal con-tainer which may form part of lighting fitting, or alternatively shall be placed in a suitably ventilated enclosure of non-combustible material or of fire-resisting construction which is reserved for this equipment. A notice, 'DANGER - HIGH VOLTAGE”, shall be placed and maintained on every such container or enclosure that is accessible to unauthorised persons and otherwise, where necessary. The word 'DANGER' shall be in block letters not less than 10 mm high and the words 'HIGH VOLTAGE' in letters not less than 5 mm high. The letters shall be in red on a white background and the size of each notice shall be not less than 65 mm by 50 mm overall.

279.	Segregation of circuits

No conductor which is in metallic connection with a discharge lamp operating at a voltage exceeding low-voltage shall be in connection with any conductor or the mains supply other than by means of any connection with earth complying with these Regulations; provided that auto-transformer delivering voltage not exceeding 1.5 kilovolts r.m.s. measured on open circuit may be used on a.c. 2-wire circuit in which one pole of the supply is connected with earth, subject to the provision of means of isolation of both poles of the supply.

280.	Isolation of circuits

One of the following means shall be provided inside the building for the isolation from all poles of the supply of every self-contained light fitting or alternatively of every circuit supplying discharge lamps operating at a voltage exceeding low voltage, except that means need not be provided for isolation from the neutral conductor of a 3-phase 4-wire installation—

(i)	an interlock on the self-contained light fitting, so arranged that before access can be had to live parts, the supply is automatically disconnected, such means being provided in ad-dition to the switch normally used for controlling the circuit;

(ii)	effective local means for the isolation of the circuit from the supply, e.g. an adjacent plug and socket-outlet conveniently placed, such means being provided in addition to the switch normally used for controlling the circuit; or

(iii)	a switch having a removable handle or a switch which can be locked, or a distribution board which can be locked, arrangements being made to prevent the restoration of the supply by unauthorised persons. Where an installation comprises more than one such switch or distribution board, all keys and removable handles shall be non-interchangeable.

281.	Fireman’s switch

A fireman’s emergency switch shall be provided for the following installations operating at a voltage exceeding medium voltage—

(i)	exterior installations;

(ii)	interior installation which run unattended (e.g. for window lighting or display purposes).

EXEMPTION.—For the purpose of regulation 282 a portable discharge-lighting fitting or sign of rating not exceeding 100 watts and fed from a socket-outlet which provides the local means of isolation required by regulation 282 (ii), need not be regarded as forming part of an interior installation operating at a voltage exceeding medium voltage.

282.

Every fireman’s emergency switch shall—

(i) be arranged to isolate the installation from all poles of the supply, except that it need not isolate the installation from the neutral conductor of a 3-phase 4-wire supply; and 

(ii)	be coloured red and have fixed near it a nameplate marked with the words, (“FIREMAN’S SWITCH”), the plate being of minimum size 150 mm by 100 mm, with lettering that shall be easily legible from a distance appropriate to the site conditions but not less than 13 mm high; and

NOTE TO ITEM (II).—It is desirable that the nameplate should also be marked with the name of the company which installed or (if different) which maintains the installation.

(iii)	have its ON and OFF positions clearly indicated by lettering legible to a person standing on the ground, and the OFF position shall be at the top; and

NOTE TO ITEM (III).—It is desirable that the fireman’s switch be provided with a lock or catch so designed as to prevent the switch being inadvertently or accidentally returned to the ON position.

(iv)	be fixed in a conspicuous position, reasonably accessible to firemen, and except in the case of an agreement to the contrary with the local fire-brigade authority, at not more than 2.75 m from the ground; and

(v)	for exterior installations, be outside the building and adjacent to the electric discharge lamp(s), or alternatively a notice indicating the position of the switch shall be placed ad-jacent to the electric discharge lamp(s) and a nameplate shall be fixed near the switch so as to render it clearly distinguishable; and

(vi)	for interior installations, be in the main entrance to the building or alternatively in a position to be agreed with the local fire brigade authority; and

NOTE TO ITEMS (V) AND (VI).—It is desirable that, whenever practicable, all exterior installations on any one building should be controlled by a single fireman’s switch. Simi-larly, all internal installations in any one building should be controlled by a single fireman’s switch independent of the switch for any external installation.

(vii)	where more than one such switch is installed on any one building be clearly marked to indicate the installation or section of the installation which it controls, and the local fire-brigade authority shall be notified accordingly.

283.

A fireman’s switch may be used to open one or more contactors or circuit-breakers for the total isolation of an installation from the supply, provided that every such contractor or circuit-breaker is arranged to open automatically on failure of the supply to its holding coil circuit.

284.	Types of cables

Connections in circuit at a voltage exceeding medium voltage shall be made by cable complying with Nigerian Standard Specifications, except as provided in regulations 285, 286, 293 and 294.

(a)	in exterior installations for inter-lamp series connections not exceeding 3 m in length which are not likely to suffer mechanical damage, or which are installed in box signs constructed substantially of non-combustible material; and

(b)	in interior installations, in self-contained light fitting.

285.	Bare or lightly insulated conductors

Bare or lightly-insulated conductors of copper or nickel having a cross-sectional area of not less than 0.4 mm2 (170.71 mm), may be used for series connections in circuit operating at a voltage exceeding low voltage, e.g. for window signs provided that either—

(a)	the conductor does not exceed 1 m length is supported at intervals not greater than 500 mm, is not exposed to the likelihood of mechanical damage, and is completely protected by non-combustible, non-hygroscopic insulating material which if in the form of glass tubing has a wall thickness not less than 1 mm and overall diameter not less than 5 mm and is so arranged as to be reasonably secured against any displacement which would expose any part of the live metal; or

(b)	the conductor is in an enclosure to the interior of which only authorised persons can have access.

286.

For shop-front fascia installations, bare or lightly insulated conductors shall be used only for con-nections housed within an earthed metal enclosure or for connections between the terminals of electrode housings. For all other connections behind or through fascia panels, including series connections, armoured or metal-sheathed or metal-braided cable shall be used.

287.

Cables and conductors in circuit operating at a voltage exceeding low voltage shall be supported at intervals not exceeding the appropriate value stated in Table 13 in the First Schedule. Supports for insu-lated and braided cables and for bare conductors shall be of non-combustible, non-hygroscopic insulating material, e.g. glass or glazed porcelain.

290.	Cable installation

In a circuit operating at a voltage exceeding medium voltage, every cable shall be supported close to each terminal connection and in no instance at a distance greater than 150 mm, or 300 mm if a glazed porcelain electrode-receptacle forming an adequate support for the cable is used.

291.

Where a connection is made to a cable in a circuit operating at a voltage exceeding medium voltage, the insulation exposed by removing the metal sheath or braid shall be suitably protected from the effect of ozone.

292.

Where likely to suffer mechanical damage, every cable in a circuit operating at a voltage exceeding low voltage shall be armoured or otherwise suitably protected. Non-armoured cable shall not be drawn into metal tubing except where they pass through walls or floors where they may be installed in short lengths of metal conduit which shall be earthed.

293.

Where not otherwise readily identifiable, cables in a circuit operating at a voltage exceeding low voltage or their protective covering shall be distinguished by tabs or labels marked 'DANGER' securely attached at intervals not greater than 1.5 m. The letters shall be in red on a white background, and shall be not less than 10 mm high.

294.	Earthed return conductors

Notes on the Application of Diversity

It is impossible to specify in these Regulations the amount of diversity for every type of installation but the figures given in the following table may be taken as a guide. The amount by which they are increased or decreased for each installation should be decided by the engineer responsible for the design of that installation. The values given in the Table refer to percentage of connected load, or, where followed by the letters 'f.l.” to the percentage of fullload current of a heating appliance, motor, or other current-using device, or a socket-outlet. In calculating the maximum current, appliances and socket-outlets should be considered in the order of their current ratings, the largest first. For installations such as blocks of flats, the calculation for diversity in the rising main should be based on the aggregate current rating of all points connected to the system and not based on the sum of the normal demands of the flats obtained after applying diversity to each flat.

APPENDIX 2

Notes on precautions against corrosion of metal sheathes of cables and metal conduit

ducts and trunking and their fixings

In damp situations, precautions are desirable against corrosion of metal cable sheaths and armour of cables, metal conduit and conduit fittings, metal duct and trunking systems, and associated metal fixings, where these are likely to come into contact with any of the following materials—

(i)	materials containing magnesium chloride which are used in the construction of floors and dadoes;

(ii)	plaster undercoats contaminated with corrosive salts;

(iii)	lime, cement and plaster (e.g. on unpainted walls);

(iv)	oak and other acidic woods;

(v)	dissimilar metals liable to set up electrolytic action.

Application of bitumen or bituminised paint before erection or prevention of contact by separation with bitumen felt, and recognised as effectual precautions against corrosion.

Special care is required in the choice of materials for clips and other fittings, for bare aluminium sheathed cables and for aluminium conduit, to avoid risk of local corrosion in damp situations. Suitable materials for this purpose are the following—

Porcelain;

Aluminium;

Corrosive-resistant aluminium alloys;

Zink alloys,

Iron or steel protected against rust by galvanizing;

Sherardising, etc.

Contact between bare aluminium sheaths or aluminium conduits and any parts made of brass or other metal having a high copper content, should be especially avoided in damp situations, unless the parts are suitably plated. If such contact is unavoidable, the joint should be completely protected against ingress of moisture, wiped joints in aluminium-sheathed cables should always be protected against moisture by a suitable paint, by an impervious tape, or by embedding in bitumen.

APPENDIX 3

Earthing tests and measurements

The following methods shall be used to carry out the test called for in these Regulations—

(1) Test of earth-continuity conductors—

The resistance of earth-continuity conductors referred to below are subject also to the requirements for earth loop impedance. Lower values than those stated may be necessary in order to meet the requirements for the total earth loop impedance (see Regulations 173).

(a) A.C. test—

Tests of earth-continuity conductors shall preferably be made with alternating current at the fre-quency of the supply and of magnitude approaching 1.5 times the rating of the final sub-circuit under test, except that the current need not exceed 25 amperes. The test shall be made when the normal supply is dis-connected from the final sub-circuit under test. One end of the earth-continuity conductors shall be connected to a cable of known resistance, which may be one of the cables of the final sub-circuit. An a.c. voltage not exceeding 40 volts shall then be applied between the other end of the earth-continuity conductor and the other end of the cable. Subject to the requirements for total earth loop impedance, it is satisfactory if in this instance the ratio voltage/current, less the resistance of the return conductor, does not exceed 1 ohm.

(b)	Reduced A.C. test—

If it is preferred, e.g. owing to the need to use hand testers, not to apply a test at full current as described above, a lower value of alternating current at approximately the frequency of the supply may be used for the testing of an a.c. installation, following in other respects the same procedure.

Subject to the requirements for total earth loop impedance, it is satisfactory if, after allowance has been made for the return conductor, a value not exceeding 0.5 ohm for the ratio voltage/current is obtained where steel conduit or pipe forms parts or whole of the earth-continuity conductor, or a value of 1 ohm where the earth-continuity conductor is composed entirely of copper, copper-alloy or aluminium. It is often more convenient if a hand-generator or other portable device can be used rather than a transformer fed from the supply, as in this event the live conductors of the various sub-circuits, while disconnected from the supply, may be connected for purpose of test to the consumer’s earthing terminal and a test can then be carried out between line and earthing conductor at each individual point, such as a socket-outlet.

(c)	D.C. test of A.C. installation—

If it is not convenient to use a.c. for the testing of an a.c. installation, d.c. may be applied instead, provided it has been ensured by inspection throughout the whole length of the earth-continuity conductor no inductor is incorporated. In these circumstances and subject to the requirements for total earth loop impedance, it is satisfactory, where steel conduit or pipe forms part or the whole of the earth-continuity conductor, if a value of resistance not exceeding 0.5 ohm is obtained, or where the earth-continuity conductor is composed entirely of copper, copper-alloy or aluminium, a value of resistance not exceeding 1 ohm.

(d)	D.C. test of D.C. installation—

Where a test of an earth-continuity conductor in a d.c. installation is required, this shall preferably be made by means of a current (which may be obtained from a secondary battery and rheostat) of magnitude approaching 1.5 times the rating of the sub-circuit under test, subject to a maximum of 25 amperes. If it is preferred not to apply a test at full current, a hand-tester may be used. In other respects the procedure set out in (a) above applies and, subject to the requirements for total earth loop impedance, it is satisfactory if the resistance obtained in the test does not exceed 1 ohm.

(2) Earth-loop impedance test—

These tests should be made with the cross bonds required by these Regulations in place. The earth-fault- loop path (line-earth loop) comprises the following parts, starting and ending at the point of fault (see also Figure 1) - the earth-continuity conductor, the consumer’s earthing terminal and the earthing lead, the metallic return path where available, which may consist of the metallic cable sheath or the continuous earth wire of an overhead line or, in the case of protective multiple earthing (P.M.E.), the neutral conductor or, where no metallic return path is available, the earth return path, and the path through the earthed neutral point of the transformer and the transformer winding, and the live conductor.

The method used may show the loop impedance in ohms, alternatively it may give a direct indication of the maximum permissible fuse rating or setting of a circuit-breaker, or an indication where a fuse or circuit- breaker of a given rating will operate satisfactorily under fault conditions.

(a)	Tests in line-earth loop—

These tests may be achieved by an instrument which determines the current flowing when a known resistance is connected between the live conductor and consumer’s earthing terminal. In using such an instrument, care should be taken that no ill effects can arise if the earthing circuit is defective.

(b)	Tests in neutral-earth loop—

Except when the system is earthed by protective multiple earthing (P.M.E.), it is permissible to test the neutral-earth loop instead of the line-earth loop. This may be achieved by a method which injects current into the neutral-earth loop, preferably by means of a transformer fed from the mains, or alternatively from the a.d.c. source the polarity of which is rapidly and continually reversed. The instrument employed must be so designed, or used, that its indications are not affected by neutral currents flowing in the system. In using such an instrument, care should be taken to ensure that no ill effects can arise if the circuit tested is defective. Measurements on systems fed from small transformers may require compensation, to include an allowance for the impedance of the windings of transformers, balancers, etc. If a test with rapidly-reversed d.c. is made on an a.c. installation, it should be ensured, by inspection, that no inductor is incorporated in the earth- continuity conductor.

When a measurement on an a.c. system is made with less than 10 amperes a.c., or with rapidly- reversed d.c., and the earth-continuity conductor is wholly or mainly of steel conduit or pipe, the effective value shall be taken as twice the measured value less the value measured at the consumer’s earthing terminal. In all other cases the effective value shall be the measured value, subject to any necessary adjustment for impedance of supply transformers, balances, etc., as mentioned above.

(3)	Test of earth leakage circuit-breakers—

For the purpose of this test a voltage not exceeding 45 volts, obtained from a double-wound transformer connected to the mains supply, shall be applied across the neutral and earth terminals (or neutral and frame terminals of a voltage-operated earth leakage circuit-breaker) and the circuit-breaker shall trip instantaneously. The transformer shall preferably have a short-time rating of not less than 750 VA. (See Figures 2 and 3).

When, in accordance with the requirements of these Regulations, across-bonding to other services is carried out in an installation where a voltage-operated earth leakage circuit-breaker is provided, this may result in a direct earth connection of low impedance being introduced in parallel with the path through the earth-leakage circuit-breaker. Thus an increased value of earth-leakage current would need to flow before the circuit-breaker came into operation, and in some instances the cross-bonding may well remedy the deficiency which originally gave rise to the need for the earth-leakage circuit-breaker. These effects are not harmful - it is common practice to use the best solid earth available (e.g. suitably spaced earth electrodes) in parallel with an earth-leakage circuit-breaker. The circuit-breaker would still be effective in preventing the exposed metal work of the installation from rising to a dangerous voltage.

(4)	Measurement of consumer’s earth-electrode resistance—

The following procedure shall be adopted where it is desired to measure the resistance of the earth electrode, e.g. where the installation fails to satisfy the earth-loop impedance test or where it is desired to check the continuity effected through an earth electrode (see Figure 4).

An alternating current of a steady value shall be passed between the earth electrode X and an auxiliary earth electrode Y placed at such a distance from X that the resistance areas of the two electrodes do not overlap. A second auxiliary earth electrode Z, which may be a metal spike driven into the ground, shall then be inserted half-way between X and Y and the voltage drop between X and Z shall be measured. The resistance of the earth electrodes is then the voltage between X and Z divided by the current flowing between X and Y, provided that there is no overlap of the resistance areas. To check that the resistance of the earth electrodes is a true value, two further readings shall be taken with the second auxiliary electrode Z moved 6m further from and 6m nearer to X respectively. If the three results are substantially in agreement, the mean of the three readings shall be taken as the resistance of the earth electrode X. If there is no such agreement the tests shall be repeated with the distance between X and Y increased.

The test shall be made either with current at power frequency, in which case the resistance of the voltmeter used must be high (of the order of 200 ohms per volt), or with alternating current from an earth tester comprising a hand-driven generator, a rectifier (where necessary), and a direct-reading ohmmeter.

If the tests are made at power frequency the source of the current used for the test shall be isolated from the power mains (e.g. by a double-wounded transformer), and in any event the earth electrode X under test shall be disconnected from all sources of supply other than that used for testing.

Preface to the tables of current rating and voltage drop

1.	Basis of current rating and values of voltage drop

The current ratings and values of voltage drop for cables and bare conductors set out in Tables 15 to 33 with the associated rating factors and notes.

The current ratings and values of voltage drop for cables are applicable only to cables of voltage rating not exceeding 600/1000V (or of voltage rating 600V or 1000V, for mineral- insulated cables).

The voltage drop for any particular cable run must be such that the total voltage drop in the circuit of which the cable forms a part does not exceed the limit prescribed in these Regulations, i.e. the total voltage drop between the consumer’s terminals and the other end of the circuit must not exceed 2.5% of the declared or nominal voltage (for example, 5.75 volts for a phase voltage of 230 volts) when the circuit is carrying the designed full load current. The tabulated current ratings may be used only where the associated values of voltage drop, adjusted in proportion to the actual length of run, do not cause that limit to be exceeded.

Values of voltage drop are tabulated for a current of one ampere for a 1 m run, i.e. for a distance of 1 m along the route taken by the cables, and represent the result of the voltage drop in all the circuit conductors. For balanced three-phase a.c. circuits the values relate to the line voltage.

For any given run the values need to be multiplied by the length of the run in meters and by the current the cables are to carry. Where the actual current to be carried differs greatly from the current rating tabulated, the results obtained by multiplying the tabulated voltage drop values in this way are approximate only; for a more accurate assessment allowance should be made for the change in conductor resistance with operating temperature.

The values of voltage drop tabulated (except those in Tables 24 - 25 and 32- 33) relate to the worst conditions, viz where the phase angle of the cable circuit is equal to that of the load. For cables up to and including 120 mm2 they apply with sufficient accuracy where the power factor of the load lies between 0.6 lagging and 1.0 and for larger cables where the power factor of the load does not exceed 0.8 lagging. In all other cases the value may be unduly conservative and more exact calculation is necessary.

As explained below, the ratings are to be modified where applicable by rating factors in respect of—

Ambient temperature;

Class of excess current protection;

Grouping;

Disposition;

Type of sheath.

If the conditions of installation of cables depart in more than one respect from those provided for in the appropriate table, it is necessary to apply a separate factor for each special circumstance. In every instance the appropriate factors are to be applied to the current ratings as multipliers.

2.	Application of rating factors

(a)	For ambient temperature—

The current rating given in the Tables for cables and bare conductors are based on an ambient air temperature of 30 °C. Where the ambient air temperature exceeds this figure, the appropriate rating factor referred to below the Table must be applied: on the other hand, if it can be established that the ambient temperature will not exceed 25 °C, use may be made of the rating factor appropriate to this temperature.

The ambient air temperature may be determined by thermometers placed in free air as close as practicable to the position at which the cables are installed or are to be installed, subject to the provision that the measurements must not be influenced by the heat arising from the cables; thus if the measurements are made while the cables are loaded, the thermometers must be placed about 0.5m from the cables, depending on their size, in the horizontal plane, or 150 mm below the lowest of the cables.

(b)	Class of excess-current protection—

Cables insulated with some thermoplastic materials (e.g. p.v.c.) may sustain serious damage when subjected even for relatively short periods to temperatures which are appreciable higher than those permissible for continuous operation. Also at such excess temperatures, if sustained, the elastic properties of the smaller sizes of cables having synthetic rubber insulation may show a tendency to deteriorate. Therefore the current ratings of cable insulated with p.v.c. or synthetic rubbers are determined not only by the maximum conductor temperature for continuous running, but also by the temperature likely to be attained under conditions of excess current. 

In the tables relating to those types of cable, therefore, the tabulated ratings are related to the class of excess-current protection afforded for the cables. For the purposes of these Regulations the following classes of excess-current protection are defined—

Close excess-current protection

Excess-current protection which will operate within four hours at 1.5 times the designed load current of the circuit which it protects. Devices affording close excess-current protection include—

(i)	fuses fitted with fuse-links of fusing factor not exceeding 1.5;

(ii)	miniature and moulded-case circuit-breakers;

(iii)	circuit-breakers set to operate at an overload not exceeding 1.5 times the designed load current of the circuit.

Coarse excess-current protection

Excess-current protection which will not operate within four hours at 1.5 times the designed load current of the circuit which it protects. Devices affording coarse excess-current protection include—

(i)	fuses fitted with fuse-links of fusing factor exceeding 1.5 but not exceeding 2.5;

(ii)	semi-enclosed (rewirable) fuses.

The heading to each table concerned states whether the tabulated ratings relate to close or coarse ex- cess-current protection. Where the class of excess-current protection to be used differs from that stated in the heading to the table, the appropriate rating factor given below the table must be applied. Examples are given below.

Example 1

A twin p.v.c. insulated cable having copper conductors is required for a single-phase a.c. circuit having a continuous load current of 60 amperes installed clipped direct to a surface and unenclosed. From Table 15 a 16 mm2 cable is suitable if it is intended that coarse excess-current protection should be provided. If close excess-current protection is to be afforded, a 10 mm2 cable (48A x 1.33 = 64A) is suitable. In either case the normal current rating of the excess-current protection device should be 60 amperes.

Example 2

A three-core p.v.c. insulated cable having copper conductors is required for a three-phase balanced a.c. circuit having a continuous load current of 300 amperes, installed singly in defined conditions in air. From Table 19 a 150 mm2 cable is suitable if close excess-current protection is to be afforded. If coarse excess- current protection is to be used, a 240 mm2 cable (420 x 0.75 = 315A) is necessary. In either case the normal current rating of the fuse or circuit-breaker should be 300 amperes.

(c)	For groups

The ratings given in the tables are for single circuits only. For groups, the appropriate rating factor referred to below the tables must be applied.

(d)	For other dispositions

The ratings given in the tables are valid only for the dispositions of cables referred to in the tables and the notes thereto. Rating factors for other dispositions of cables in enclosed trenches are given in Tables 34 and 35.

(e)	For type of sheath or finish

In the absence of any indication to the contrary it may be assumed that each table is applicable to every type of cable falling within the group described by the heading to the table. Where rating factors for type of sheath and/or armoured and/or finish are stated below a table, they must be applied to the appropriate columns of the table as indicated.

3.	Cables run under defined conditions

The current ratings in the columns of the tables headed 'Defined conditions' apply to cables run under the conditions defined below—

(a) Single-core cables

(1)	Two or three single-core cables are installed one above the other, fixed to the vertical surface of a wall or open cable trench as follows, the distance between the wall and the surface cable being at least 20 mm in each instance. Cables in which the conductor cross-sectional area exceeds 185 mm2 are installed at a distance between centres of about 90 mm.

The ratings for two cables may be applied with safety in instances where such cables are installed in horizontal formation on brackets fixed to a wall, either spaced as indicated above, or touching throughout.

(2)	Three single-core cables are installed in trefoil formation, fixed to the vertical surface of a wall or open cable trench, the cables touching throughout and the distance between the wall and the surface of the nearest cable being at least 20 mm; or, alternatively, three single-core cables are installed in trefoil formation and laid on a non-metallic floor, the cables touching each other and the floor throughout.

The ratings given apply provided that the sheaths of single-core metal-sheathed cables are electrically bonded at each end of the run. The cables are assumed to be remote from iron, steel, or ferro-concrete, other than the cable supports.

(b) Multi-core cables

Cables of all types other than single-core cables are installed singly, fixed to the vertical surface of a wall, open cable trench, the distance between the surface of the cable and the wall being at least 20 mm in every instance.

For cables spaced by distances less than those described above, the current ratings in the columns headed 'Clipped direct to a surface	' should be applied.

cation. This text will be inserted and issued to subscribers in subsequent updates.)

4.	Types of cable and conditions of installation not provided for in the tables

To reduce the number of tables of current rating that would otherwise need to be included in the Regulations, ratings are not tabulated for types of cable and/or conditions of installation in less common use. Thus ratings for the following types and conditions have been omitted—

(i)	rubber-insulated non-flexible multi-core cables;

(ii)	cables insulated with varnished fabric (Terylene) or with varnished cambric and heat- resisting fibre;

(iii)	p.v.c. insulated and p.v.c.-upsheathed circular cables of conductor size to and including 16 mm2;

(iv)	paper-insulated cables;

(v)	p.v.c.-insulated cables, non-armoured, copper-clad conductors; circular twin and multi-core type, and single core cables of conductors size above 35 mm2;

(vi)	cables in underground pipes and ducts;

(vii)	cables buried direct in the ground;

(viii)	overhead line conductors;

(ix)	400 Hz ratings;

(x)	cables insulated with heat-resisting p.v.c. compound.

The overload within these limits shall be at the discretion of the licensee.

(5)	Each motor shall also be provided with an automatic no-voltage release and a series resistance for starting.

(6)	The negative conductor shall be continuous throughout its length without a switch, fuse or cir-cuit-breaker.

43.	System earthing

(1) In medium and low voltage alternating current systems the connection of circuits with earth shall be made in accordance with the Nigerian Standard Code of Practice on Earthing (NCP 9) and the following requirements—

(a) 	the intermediate conductor of a medium or, low voltage three-wire single phase system, and the neutral conductor of a medium three-phase four-wire system, shall be earthed in multiple,

that is, at the point of supply (the generating station, substation or transformer) every fifth pole and the terminal poles of the distribution line. The consumer’s earth must not be connected to the neutral conductor;

(b)	the neutral point of a medium voltage three-phase intermediate or neutral conductor and earth shall not exceed 2 ohms;

(c)	the neutral point of a medium voltage three-phase three-wire system shall be effectively earthed at the point of supply.

(2) In high voltage three-phase alternating current systems, the connections of the circuit with earth shall be made in accordance with regulations 44 and 45.

44.	Star-connected systems with earthed neutral

(1)	The neutral point shall be earthed at the point of supply, that is, the generator neutral point or the neutral point of the transformer secondary where change of voltage occurs - and it may be earthed at any other point, provided that no interference of any description is caused by such earthing.

(2)	In the event of an appreciable harmonic current flowing in the neutral connection such as to cause interference with communication circuits the generator or transformer neutral shall not be earthed, but a suitable earthing transformer shall be used.

(3)	In unattended generating stations or substations supplying overhead lines earth leakage relays shall be provided, so that in the event of a leak to earth occurring either the faulty line will be cut out or the whole of the system supplied from this station or substation rendered dead.

(4)	These leakage relays if connected to individual feeders or lines shall be set to operate with a time lag not exceeding five seconds with a current not exceeding ten per cent of the full load rating of the feeder or line, or, if connected between the neutral point of the generator or transformer and earth, at a current not exceeding one ampere.

(5)	Where under any conditions the use of earth leakage relays may be impracticable such relays may, with the written consent of the Director of Electrical Inspectorate Services be omitted; (it is suggested that additional devices be considered).

(6)	In continuously attended generating stations or substations a visual and audible indication may be used to supplement the automatic disconnection of supply. In such case immediate steps shall be taken to remove the fault or disconnect the faulty feeder or line.

45.	Delta-connected systems or star-connected systems with isolated neutrals

(1)	In the case of delta-connected systems or star-connected systems with isolated neutral earthing transformers or other means approved by the Director Electrical Inspectorate Services shall be provided to give an artificial neutral point which shall be earthed. Earthing equipment shall be of sufficient capacity to ensure the effective operation of the protective apparatus: similar leakage protection or indication shall be provided for these systems to that specified in regulations 44 (3) and (6) for systems with earthed neutrals.

(2)	High voltage single-phase systems derived from delta or star-connected systems shall be earthed in a manner approved by the Director Electrical Inspectorate Services.

(3)	Where any part of supply system other than on a consumer’s premises, is normally connected with earth, no switch, fuse, or circuit-breaker shall be inserted in the earthed conductor or in any con-ductor connected thereto, and the connection with earth shall be efficiently maintained except when it is interrupted for the purpose of periodical tests.

(4)	Notwithstanding anything contained in the last preceding regulation, systems including more than one generator operating in parallel may have the neutral conductor of a three-phase star-connected generator disconnected when necessary to prevent the circulation of local currents provided that where
