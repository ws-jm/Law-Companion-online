(5)	An application for compensation filed by a parent or guardian on behalf of any dependant of a deceased employee, who is under eighteen years of age, shall be a valid election under this section.

(6)	If the employee or dependant applies to the Board claiming compensation under this Act, neither the making of the application nor the payment of compensation under it restricts or impairs any right of action against the party liable, but as to every such claim, the Board is subrogated to the rights of the employee or dependant and may maintain an action in the name of the employee or dependant or in the name of the Board, and if more is recovered and collected than the amount of the compensation to which the employee or dependant would be entitled under this Act, the amount of the excess, less costs and administration charges shall be paid to the employee or dependant.

(7)	The Board shall, with respect to the provisions of subsection (6) of this section, have exclusive competence to determine whether to maintain an action or compromise the right of action and its decision shall be final.

(2)	Any person who contravenes the provisions of subsection (1) of this section, commits an offence and shall—

(a)	be liable on conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year or to a fine of not less than ₦ 100,000 or to both such imprisonment and fine; and

(b)	in addition to the penalty in paragraph (a) of this subsection, repay to the employee any sum which has been so deducted or otherwise contributed from the remuneration of the employee.

15.	Compensation not assignable or liable to attachment

A sum payable as compensation or by way of computation of a periodic payment in respect of it shall not be assigned, charged or attached, nor shall it pass by operation of the law except to a personal representative, and a claim shall not be set off against it except for money advanced by way of financial or other social welfare assistance owing to the Federal, State or Local Government, or for money owing to the Board.

16.	Vocational rehabilitation, etc.

PART IV

Scale of Compensation

17.	Compensation in fatal cases

(1) Where death results from the injury of an employee, compensation shall be paid to the dependants of the deceased—

(a) where the deceased employee leaves dependants wholly dependent on his earnings a widow or widower—

(i)	and two or more children, a monthly payment of a sum equal to ninety per cent of the total monthly remuneration of the employee as at the date of death.

(ii)	and one child, a monthly payment of a sum equal to eighty-five per cent of the total monthly remuneration of the deceased employee as at the date of death.

(iii)	without a child who, at the date of death of the employee, is fifty years of age or above, or is an invalid spouse, a monthly payment of a sum equal to sixty per cent of the total monthly remuneration of the deceased employee; and

(iv)	who, at the dale of the death of the employee is not an invalid spouse, is under the age of fifty years and has no dependent children; a monthly payment of a sum that is equal to the product of the percentage determined by subtracting one per cent from sixty per cent for each year for which the age of the dependant, at the date of death of the employee, is under the age of fifty years, and provided that the total percentage shall not be less than thirty per cent;

(b)	where there is no surviving spouse eligible for monthly payments under this section, and the—

(i)	dependant is a child, a monthly payment of a sum equal to forty per cent of the total monthly rate of compensation under this Act that would have been payable if the de-ceased employee had, at the date of death, sustained a permanent total disability;

(ii)	dependants are two children, a monthly payment of a sum equal to sixty per cent of the monthly rate or compensation under this Act that would have been payable if the deceased employee had, at the date of death, sustained a permanent total disability; or

(iii)	dependants are three or more children, a monthly payment of a sum equal to eighty per cent of the total monthly rate of compensation under this Act that would have been payable if the deceased had, at the date of death, sustained a permanent total disability;

(c)	monthly payments to eligible children under this Act shall be made to children up to the age of twenty-one or until they complete undergraduate studies, whichever comes first;

(d)	where the surviving child is disabled, the Board shall determine the period of the modify payment for such time as the Board believes that the disabled child would not have been de-pendent on the deceased employee;

(e)	where the deceased employee does not leave a dependent spouse or child entitled to compensation under this section, but leaves other dependant or next of kin who were wholly dependent on him or her, the Board shall determine a sum reasonable and proportionate to the pecuniary loss suffered by such dependants or next of kin by reason of death of the employee;

(f)	where—

(i)	no compensation is payable under subsection (1) (a) to (e) of this section; or

(ii)	the compensation is payable only to a spouse, a child or children or a parent or parents; but the employee leaves a spouse, child or parent who, though not dependent on the remuneration of the employee at the time of the death of the employee, had a reason-able expectation of pecuniary benefit from the continuation of the life of the employee,

the Board shall make monthly payment of an amount to be determined by the Board to such spouse,

child or children, parent or parents; and

(g)	where the employee leaves no dependent widow or widower, or the widow or widower subse-quently dies, and the Board considers it desirable to continue the existing household, and when a suitable person acts as a foster parent or an administrator of the estate of the deceased employee in keeping up the household and taking care of and maintaining the children entitled to compensation, in a manner satisfactory to the Board, the same allowance shall be payable to the foster parent or administrator and on behalf of the children as would have been payable to a widow or widower and children, and shall be continued as long as those conditions continue.

(2) Where a disabled spouse ceases to be disabled, or a widow or widower with dependent children no longer has dependent children or there is a reduction in the number of dependent children, the

spouse, widow, widower or children shall be entitled to the same category of benefits as would have been payable if the death of the employee had occurred on the date the disabled spouse ceases to be disabled or the widow or widower no longer has dependent children or the number of dependent children is reduced, as the case may be.

(3)	Where there is a widow or widower and a child or children, and the widow or widower subse-quently dies, the allowances to the children shall, if they are in other respects eligible, continue and be calculated in the same manner as if the employee had died leaving no dependent spouse.

(4)	Where at the date of death a spouse is not disabled, but is suffering from a disability that results in a substantial impairment of work ability and earning capacity, the Board may, having regard to the degree of disability or the extent of impairment of work ability or earning capacity, pay the spouse a proportion of the compensation that would have been payable if the spouse had been disabled.

(5)	For the purpose of this Act, where two employees in a workplace are married to each other and both are contributing to the support of a common household, each is deemed to be a dependant of the other.

(6)	Where two parents contribute to the support of a common household in which their children also reside, the children are deemed to be dependants of the parent whose death is compensable under this Act.

(7)	Where compensation is payable as the result of the death of an employee, or of injury resulting in death, and where at the date of death the employee and dependant spouse were living separate and apart and there was—

(a)	in force at the date of death a court order or separation agreement providing periodic payments for support of the dependent spouse or children living with that spouse, no compensation under subsection (1) of this section shall be payable to the spouse or children living with the spouse, but monthly payments shall be made in respect of that spouse and those children equal to the periodic payments due under the order or agreement; or

(b)	no court order or separation agreement in force at the date of death providing periodic pay-ments for support of the dependent spouse, or children living with that spouse, and the em-ployee and dependent spouse were—

(i)	living separate and apart for a period of less than three months preceding the date of death of the employee, compensation shall be payable in accordance with the provi-sions of subsection (1) of this section; or

(ii)	separated with the intention of living separate and apart for a period of three months or longer preceding the death of the employee, monthly payments shall be made up to the level of support which the Board believes the spouse and those children would have been likely to receive from the employee if the death had not occurred.

(8)	The compensation payable under subsection (7) of this section shall not exceed the compensation that would have been payable under subsection (1) of this section had there been no separation.

(9)	Where an employee has lived with and contributed to the support and maintenance of a wife or husband and the employee and the wife or husband have—

(a)	no children, for a period of three years; or

(b)	children, for a period of one year, immediately preceding the death of the employee, and where the employee does not leave a dependent widow or widower,

the Board may pay the compensation to which a dependent widow or widower would have been en-titled under this Act to the wife or husband.

(10)	Where—

(a)	an employee has lived with and contributed to the support and maintenance of a wife or hus-band for the period set out in subsection (9) of this section;

(b)	an employee also left, surviving, a dependent widow or widower from whom, at the date of death, the employee was living separate and apart; and

(c)	there is a difference in the amount of compensation payable to the widow or widower by reason of the separation and the amount of compensation that would have been payable to that spouse if that spouse and the employee had not been living separate and apart,

the Board may pay compensation to the wife or husband up to the amount of the difference.

(11)	Where in any situation there is a need to apportion allowances payable to dependants among those dependants, the formula for apportionment shall be determined by the Board, unless the Board has grounds for a different apportionment, the sharing formula shall be where there—

(a)	is a dependent spouse and one child, two-thirds to the dependent spouse and one-third to the child;

(b)	is a dependent spouse and more than one child, half to the dependent spouse and half among the children in equal shares; and

NOTICE OF PROPOSED ESTABLISHMENT OF A METHODOLOGY FOR A

MULTI YEAR TARIFF ORDER

In exercise of the powers conferred upon it by section 76 (6) of the Electric Power Sector Reform Act and of all other powers enabling it in that behalf, the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission, hereby gives notice of the proposed establishment of a methodology for a multi year tariff order.

INVITATION FOR COMMENTS

1.	Introduction

The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission proposes the establishment of a Multi Year Tariff Order (MYTO) pursuant to the authority given under section 76 of the Electric Power Sector Reform Act (2005). By this notice, the Commission sets out the basis and pricing principles underlying the proposed MYTO and lays out the due process to be followed in meeting the statutory requirement.

The MYTO provides a fifteen year tariff path for the electricity industry, with limited minor reviews each year in the light of changes in a limited number of parameters (such as inflation and gas prices) and major reviews every five years, when all of the inputs are reviewed with stakeholders.

The public, stakeholders and any affected parties are hereby invited to send their objections, com-ments or representations to the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission at Adamawa Plaza, Plot 1099, First Avenue, Off Shehu Shagari Way, Central Business District, P.M.B. 136, Garki, Abuja, 

Federal Capital Territory, Nigeria within thirty days. Respondents are requested to provide two hard copies of their comments to the above address or forward comments electronically to the following email address:—Comments@nercng.org.

1.1 Legislative Authority

1.1.1.	Section 76 of the Electric Power Sector Reform Act (2005) stipulates that elec-tricity tariffs shall be regulated according to one or more methodologies adopted by the Commission.

1.1.2.	With respect to activities that come under the scope of tariff regulation, the Electric Power Sector Reform Act (2005) specifies the following activities—

(a)	Generation and trading, in respect of which licences are required pursuant to this Act, and where the Commission considers regulation of prices necessary to prevent abuses of market power, and

(b)	Transmission, distribution and system operation, in respect of which licences are required under this Act (subsections 76 (1) (a) and (b)).

1.1.3.	Specifically, sub-section 76 (6) of the Electric Power Sector Reform Act provides that the Commission, prior to approving a tariff methodology, shall give notice in the Official Gazette, and in one or more newspapers with wide circulation of the proposed establishment of a tariff methodology indicating the period within which objections or representations in connection with the same may be made to the Commission.

1.1.4.	Section 76(7) provides that in preparing a tariff methodology, the Commission shall—

(a) Consider any representations made by licence applicants, other licensees, consumers, eligible customers, consumer associations, associations of eligible customers and such other persons as it considers necessary or desirable;

(b) Obtain evidence, information or advice from any person who, in the Commission’s opinion, possesses expert knowledge which is relevant in the preparation of the methodology (subsection 76 (7)).

1.1.5.	Consequently, the Commission fixes thirty days from the publication of this notice for comments, objections and representations on the tariff methodology to be sent to the Commission.

1.1.6.	The Commission, therefore, proposes that the final methodology, after the con-sultation process, will be issued in the form of a decision of the Commission and gazetted. Licensees will be required to comply with the provisions of the methodology, under the conditions of their licences (subsection 76 (11)).

1.2.	Background

1.2.1.	The Electric Power Sector Reform Act (2005) requires that the regulation of electricity prices shall be governed by a tariff methodology, which shall be de-veloped by the Commission. The Commission has looked at the regulation of the electricity supply industry around the world and considered a number of possible approaches, discussed further in paragraph 2 below.

1.2.2.	The Commission has adopted three basic principles in the determination of an appropriate methodology. These principles require that a regulatory methodology—

• Produces outcomes that are fair;

•	Encourages outcomes that are efficient in that it involves the lowest possible costs to Nigeria and encourages investment in electricity gen-eration; and

•	Is simple, transparent and avoids excessive regulatory costs.

1.2.3.	While these principles can be stated simply, they can become complex. What may seem fair to one group (consumers) may not seem the same to another (suppliers). However, the Commission is required to balance the interests of all parties (Section 76 of the Electric Power Sector Reform Act) and consider that the objectives of both stakeholder groups are joined by the common need to ensure that the electricity supply system is viable, adequate, reliable and safe. Efficiency also includes a number of important concepts. It means producing electricity at the lowest cost as well as providing incentives for new investment in the industry.

1.2.4.	A fair and equitable tariff methodology should cover both the determination of the total allowed revenues that can be earned from regulated tariffs and the principles governing the structure of tariffs used to recover these revenues.

2,	The Proposed Tariff Methodology

2.1.	The Methodology Used to Develop the Multi Year Tariff Order (MYTO)

2.1.1.	The methodology used by the Commission to determine the MYTO tariff path is known as the building blocks approach. This was selected from a number of alternative methods, such as price cap regulation and rate of return regulation, which is also called cost of service regulation. The advantage of the building blocks approach is that it combines the positive attributes of rate of return regulation and price caps.

2.1.2.	This type of regulation is known as incentive-based regulation. The Nigerian electricity supply industry needs to improve performance on a number of levels and this form of regulation provides incentives to do so. While the costs and other inputs used to set up a building blocks methodology are historical, the tariff path is forward-looking and based on projections of performance. The regulated entities have an incentive to do better than the projected performance levels built into the tariff path.

2.1.3.	There are three standard building blocks used in this approach—

•	The allowed return on capital - being the return necessary to achieve a fair rate of return on the necessary assets invested in the business;

•	The allowed return of capital - associated with recouping the capital over the useful lives of the assets (depreciation); and

•	Efficient operating costs and overheads.

2.1.4.	The inputs to the building blocks methodology include an initial capital valua-tion and future levels of capital expenditure, operating costs, sates volumes, cost and efficiency improvements to derive a future average regulated tariff for each year of the MYTO. This annual tariff can then be expressed in a formula as the percentage change over each of the annual tariff setting periods.

2.1.5.	Each company’s incentive to outperform the performance standards in the MYTO will be based on its own costs, and productivity considerations.

2.1.6.	At the commencement of the MYTO all prices will be regulated but this will be reduced over time as competition increases in the market and electricity supply is sufficient to meet requirements. The major parts of the electricity industry are generation, transmission and distribution and retailing. These parts will be regulated as follows—

(EDITORIAL NOTE: Wording as per Gazette.)

2.1.7.	Generation will be subject to vesting contracts, which will set prices to be re-ceived by all generators who do not currently hold Power Purchase Agreements. Eventually, when the industry matures, generation prices will not be regulated.

2.1.8.	Transmission will remain monopoly and will be subject to tariff regulation. However, all generators will enjoy open access and transparent pricing. The building blocks approach will be applied to produce a long term tariff path.

2.1.9.	Distribution is also treated as a monopoly and its prices will be regulated, again using the building blocks approach.

2.1.10.	Until the time that retail choice is introduced, retail sales and marketing will also be regulated as part of distribution and a building blocks approach will be applied to all of the distribution companies activities.

2.1.11.	In the Transition and Medium Term market phases, therefore, the MYTO derives a tariff for transmission and distribution/marketing using a building blocks approach as well as prices for generation under vesting contracts. Brought together, these three components combine to produce an end-user tariff.

2.2.	Treatment of Capital Costs in MYTO

2.2.1.	Capital Cost

2.2.1.1.	Two out of the three building blocks provide a return of, and to capital invested. In a very capital intensive industry like electricity supply it is important that the cost of capital is recognised and that new capital investment is allowed a reasonable return. If it is not new investment will be discouraged and future demand will not be met. In this case regulation will have done more harm than good.

2.2.1.2.	The initial value of the assets is rolled forward each year. Depreciation reduces the valuation and new capital expenditure increases it. Replacement costs, actual capacity ratings and remaining economic life were taken into account in this valuation.

2.2.1.3.	The cost of capital under a building blocks approach comprises two components; the return of capital (that is, depreciation) and the return on capital (measured by the cost of capital). The capital stock to which both of these are applied is the annual asset value of the electricity supply industry the rolled forward asset value.

2.2.1.4.	 The allowed return on capital is aimed at providing appropriate in-centives for future investment. Thus, in all building block regimes, the cost of capital is provided to all approved new investment under the regime. This is typically done via the mechanism of rolling forward new investment into the regulatory asset base. 

2.2.2.	Treatment of depreciation in MYTO

2.2.2.1.	The depreciation method to be used for the calculation of future tariffs will be the optimised depreciated replacement cost (ODRC) method. This involves—

•	Adjusting the cost of an asset from the year of its purchase to the year of the tariff calculation;

•	Optimising its capacity (i.e. this usually means excluding any unnecessary expenditure or over-building); and

•	Applying depreciation over the economic life of the individual asset or groups of assets.

2.22.2.	In Nigeria all of the available electricity assets are generally used to their maximum capacity and NERC does not envisage reducing the value of existing assets through the optimisation process. The MYTO is likely to be operated in this way for some time until the Nigerian electricity market matures.

2.2.2.3.	The depreciation schedule for regulatory purposes will be applied to each group of assets so that to the maximum extent that is reasonable, it reflects the remaining economic life of the asset or group of assets.

2.2.2.4.	Within the life of the MYTO it would also be reasonable to assume that the economic life of assets that will be in the competitive part of the electricity supply industry, such as generation, will equal technical life. The rationale for this is that at present generation, transmission or distribution capacity are in short supply and there is a strong likelihood of high demand growth once a reliable electricity supply is offered.

2.2.3.	Treatment of the Cost of Capital (the Weighted Average Cost of Capital)

2.2.3.1.	The cost of capital is a key input into the determination of tariffs, since the return on existing and new assets is a significant element of the revenue requirement of the electricity business.

2.2.3.2.	The basis for estimating the cost of capital for a utility business is the cost of capital that would be required by a privately owned business with similar risk characteristics. The cost of capital to be used by NERC in calculating electricity tariffs will be estimated as a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) using an estimation of the cost of equity and a cost of debt which reflects bond finance costs.

2.2.3.3.	Instead of applying different returns to different components of capital, such as debt and equity, a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) recognises that lenders and equity investors require differ-ent rates of return because of the different risks they face. The WACC aggregates these returns, and weights each according to the estimated percentages of debt and equity in the industry.

2.2.3.4.	The cost of debt is directly observable as commercial interest rates. The returns required by equity are not and are typically estimated.

2.2.3.5.	The cost of debt is almost always lower than the cost of equity, with

the WACC lying in between.

2.3.	Treatment of Operational Expenses in MYTO

2.3.1.	The initial operating costs used in calculating the tariff will be those gathered from the Nigerian electricity industry from 2000 to 2006.

2.3.2.	Operation and maintenance costs are assumed to include an allowance for the improved performance required under the performance indicators which will be included in the MYTO. A number of items of plant are currently out of service for want of maintenance. The repair or replacement of these units would improve supply and reduce the quantity of unserved energy. In the future, the use of spinning reserve units, which would reduce the number and duration of outages, might also involve slightly higher operating costs. The MYTO would acknowledge that these costs were required to provide a reliable service.

2.3.3.	It is expected that operation, maintenance, management and staff costs may be higher initially and the tariff calculation will include the assumption that an additional sum for operation and maintenance costs will be needed each year, in the short term the tariff calculation will include an allowance for overheads (administration central stores and other centralised functions) but in the longer term the MYTO will include the assumption that overheads and administration are gradually reduced.

2.3.4.	The assumptions in the MYTO concerning the electricity industry’s ability to collect sales revenue will begin at current low levels but will be assumed to improve over the first five years, coinciding with an increase in metering rollout and billing expenditure.

3.	Pricing Generation in MYTO

3.1.	The most passing issue in the electricity sector is the shortage of generation capacity to meet demand. Exacerbating this under-investment in capacity a high proportion of the electricity supply industry’s generation capacity is unusable through lack of maintenance (plant availability is below sixty per cent) and reinvestment. This situation is being ad-dressed in part by the current network building programme aimed at increasing capacity to 10,000 MW by the end of 2007.

3.2.	The current structure of the generation sector is characterised by a large dominant gov-ernment owned business together with a small presence from independent power producers (IPPs). This is expected to change as the industry is transformed in the coming years and the MYTO has the flexibility to cope with this change.

3.3.	Securing new investment in generation capacity through the establishment of private sector participation in a competitive energy market is a major part of the overall reform vision for the Nigerian electricity supply industry. Once the industry has reached the ‘steady-state’ stage, it is intended that generation will operate within a commercial environment, with generators entering into commercial bilateral contracts with distributors. Ultimately, the price of wholesale electricity will be market based and be reflected in the final tariff to users (and included with the regulated transmission and distribution charges, the costs of retail functions, and other costs).

3.4.	Moving from the current arrangements to the final stage of a competitive wholesale market for energy will not happen overnight. One essential pre-condition is the attainment of a sufficient number of private suppliers into the industry. A second is the removal of the huge supply deficit.

3.5.	The main objectives in selling bulk electricity prices in vesting contracts are to cover the costs of existing plant and allow for their efficient maintenance and ongoing investment programmes while ensuring that an appropriate incentive exists for new entry generation. For this reason the appropriate price for bulk electricity supplied by generators under vesting contracts is the unit price an efficient new plant would require in the Nigerian electricity supply industry.

3.6.	The strategy for managing the transition to a competitive wholesale market includes the use of vesting contracts for generators. Vesting contracts have been used in many countries as a means to manage the transition to a competitive market.

3.7.	In the MYTO in the first five year period the cost of generation will comprise vesting contracts for generators and the cost of existing Power Purchase Agreements.

4.	Pricing Transmission in MYTO

4.1.	Transmission charges in the MYTO will have the following components—

*	A connection charge for new generators that covers their costs in connecting to the high voltage network.

*	The covering of transmission losses at different connection points on the network by generators injecting enough power to cover their contracted amounts plus the associated transmission losses.

*	A charge on distributors, per unit of energy taken from the high voltage system at the bulk supply points.

4.2.	The connection charge above will be a once only charge to cover the costs of transmission infrastructure required to connect a new power station to the transmission network. It will vary according to how much capital expenditure is required and how far the power station is from the existing network.

4.3.	The second charge above relates to the cost of transmission losses. Transmission systems lose between 5 and 10% of the energy injected into them through heating and leakage. Generators will effectively pay for these losses by injecting a sufficient amount in excess of their contracted amounts to cover the losses associated with their sales. For example, if the losses associated with their injection point are 5%, they will be required to inject 105% of their sales volumes in each settlement period.

4.4.	The transmission tariff to be levied on distribution companies will be based on a building blocks methodology, although the costs associated with losses from the network will not be included in the calculation as this component will be covered by the generators.

4.5.	The charges have been designed in this way so that—

*	Electricity generators see an incentive to locate reasonably close to the transmission network as they will pay the costs of connection;

*	Electricity generators will also see an incentive to locate at places on the network where losses are low. Such points are typically near load centres or at the end of long transmission lines to isolated load centres;

*	Electricity distributors effectively pay for the capital cost of the distribution system as well as operation and maintenance.

5.	Pricing Distribution and Retailing

5.1.	Distribution tariffs are similar in a number of respects to transmission tariffs. Most of the cost of the distribution network arises from the capital expenditure needed to build and  

maintain it. The most useful guide to the future level of necessary capital expenditure comes from the forecasts of peak demand for each electricity distributor. Distributors would likely grow at different rates and their capital needs will therefore vary.

5.2.	The Distribution Use of System (DUOS) tariff will cover the cost of distribution and marketing. DUOS charges are calculated according to the building blocks methodology and include allowances for capital expenditure, operation and maintenance of the network, losses across the distribution networks and metering costs.

5.3.	These costs are included in the MYTO along with the operating and administration costs of retailing and billing electricity sales.

5.4.	At the first five-year review, the Commission will gather information from the distribution companies on the reliability and quality of the supply that they deliver.

6.	Why a Multi Year Tariff Order?

6.1.	The MYTO provides a stable price path into the future. The tariffs will be reviewed each year by the Commission but will only be varied according to varying rates of inflation the cost of input fuel for electricity generation (primarily gas) and exchange rate fluctuations.

6.2.	The major five-yearly tariff review will consider each of the input assumptions for the tariff model in order to update them to appropriate current values.

6.3.	Major reviews will be undertaken at less than five year intervals if industry participants can demonstrate to NERC that industry parameters have changed from those used in the MYTO to such an extent that a review is required urgently to maintain industry viability.

6.4.	At the commencement of the major five-year review. NERC will prepare a consultation paper that will indicate the issues to be covered. The Commission will inform those parties who will be regulated by the review of the information it seeks from each of them. All regulated electricity operators will be the major source of information on the industry. As part of the regulatory process they will be required to provide verifiable information on a uniform reporting and accounting basis regarding their regulated operations on matters such as—

•	capital expenditure;

•	actual and projected sales;

•	operating costs;

•	fuel costs; and

•	taxes and other payments.

6.5.	While NERC will be informed by the industry’s views on a number of matters it will develop its own analysis and conclusions on important parameters. These include; forecasts of electricity demand, interest rates and a reasonable industry WACC, appropriate expansion of the transmission and distribution networks and reasonable annual rates of reduction of industry losses, particularly non-technical losses.

6.6.	A five-yearly Review is likely to take about twelve months. It will be commenced more than one year before the beginning of the new five year tariff period.

6.7.	In the initial years the tariff path also allows the industry some time to ramp up gradually to appropriate tariff levels, avoiding a large step change in one year.

6.8.	A long term tariff path also reduces some of the risks for both major electricity consumers and investors in the industry. While they do not know the exact level of future tariffs they know how they will be calculated and that they will be reasonably consistent between the five year reviews.

6.9.	The general public is invited to send its comments to the Commission as stipulated in paragraph 1 above.

(4)	Where a Customer requests the special meter reading but fails to provide access, the Distribution Company shall advise the Customer in writing that no further attempts to obtain a special meter reading shall be made and that the meter reading questioned by the Customer shall be deemed by the Distribution Company to be accepted as correct by the Customer.

4.	Billing

(1)	Every Distribution Company shall issue bills for electricity used at each Customer’s supply ad-dress at regular intervals approved by the Commission.

(2)	A Distribution Company may not issue more than one routine bill to any Customer during the same billing period.

NIGERIAN ELECTRICITY REGULATORY COMMISSION’S NOTICE OF THE DATE

OF COMMENCEMENT OF A MULTI-YEAR TARIFF METHODOLOGY

[S.I. No. 10 of 2008.]

[Date of Commencement: 1st July, 2008]

In exercise of the powers conferred upon it by section 76 (8) of the Electric Power Sector Reform Act and all other powers enabling it in that behalf and all others powers, The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission, hereby gives Notice of the date of commencement of a Multi-Year Tariff Methodology:

Introduction

1.1.	The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission has established a Multi-Year Tariff Methodology pursuant to the authority given under section 76 of the Electric Power Sec-tor Reform Act (2005). By this notice, the Commission sets out the basis and pricing principles underlying the Methodology as well as the date of its commencement. The Methodology provides a fifteen year tariff path for the electricity industry, with minor re-views each year in the light of changes in a limited number of parameters (such as inflation, exchange rate and gas prices) and major reviews every five years, when all of the inputs are reviewed with stakeholders.

Legislative Authority

1.1.1.	Section 76 of the Electric Power Sector Reform Act (2005) stipulates that Electricity tariffs shall be regulated according to one or more methodologies adopted by the Commission.

1.1.2.	With respect to activities that come under the scope of tariff regulation, the Electric Power Sector Reform Act (2005) specifies the following activities—

(a) generation and trading, in respect of which licences are required pursuant to this Act, and where the Commission considers regulation of prices necessary to prevent abuse of market power; and

(b) transmission, distribution and system operation, in respect of which licences are required under this Act (subsections 76 (1) (a) (b)).

1.1.3.	Specifically, subsection 76 (8) of the Electric Power Sector Reform Act provides that the Commission shall fix the date on which the tariff methodology shall come into operation and it shall cause notice to be given in the Official Gazette of that date.

1.1.4.	The Commission has issued a tariff in accordance with the methodology, which tariff has been published on the Commission’s website. By virtue of section 76 (11) of the EPSR Act 2005, Licensees are required to comply with the provisions of the methodology, under the conditions of their licences.

El-212 

Background

1.2.1.	The Electric Power Sector Reform Act (2005) requires that the regulation of electricity prices shall be governed by a tariff methodology, which shall be de-veloped by the Commission. The Commission has studied the regulation of the electricity supply industry in other jurisdictions, considered a number of possible approaches, and adopted three basic principles in the determination of an appropriate methodology. These principles require that a regulatory methodology—

(a) produces outcomes that are fair;

(b)	encourages outcomes that are efficient in that it involves the lowest possi-ble costs to Nigeria and encourages investment in electricity generation; and

(c)	is simple, transparent and avoids excessive regulatory costs.

1.2.2.	While these principles can be stated fairly simply, they can become complex. What may seem fair to one group (e.g. consumers) may not seem the same to another (e.g. suppliers). However, in furtherance of section 76 of the EPSR Act, the Commission balanced the interests of all parties and considered that the interest of both stakeholder groups are represented by the common need to ensure that the electricity supply system is viable, adequate, reliable and safe. Efficiency also includes a number of important concepts. It means producing electricity at the lowest cost as well as providing incentives for new investment in the industry.

1.2.3.	A fair and equitable tariff methodology should cover both the determination of the total allowed revenues that can be earned from regulated tariffs and the principles governing the structure of tariffs used to recover these revenues.

The Tariff Methodology

2.1.	The Methodology Used to Develop the Multi-Year Tariff Order (MYTO)

2.1.1.	The methodology used by the Commission to determine the MYTO tariff path is known as the building blocks approach. This was selected from a number of alternative methods, such as price cap regulation and rate of return regulation, which is also called cost of service regulation. The advantage of the building blocks approach is that it combines the positive attributes of rate of return regulation and price caps.

2.1.2.	This type of regulation is known as incentive-based regulation. The Nigerian electricity supply industry needs to improve performance on a number of levels and this form of regulation provides incentives to do so.

While the costs and other inputs used to set up a building blocks methodology are historical, the tariff path is forward-looking and based on projections of performance. The regulated entities have an incentive to do better than the pro-jected performance levels built into the tariff path.

2.1.3.	There are three standard building blocks used in this approach—

(a)	the allowed return on capital-being the return necessary to achieve a fan- rate of return on the necessary assets invested in the business;

(b)	the allowed return of capital-associated with recouping the capital over the useful life of the assets (depreciation); and

(c)	efficient operating costs and overheads.

2.1.4.	The inputs to the building blocks methodology include an initial capital valuation and future levels of capital expenditure, operating costs, sales volumes, cost of efficiency improvements to derive a future average regulated tariff for each year of the MYTO. This annual tariff can then be expressed in a formula as the percentage change over each of the annual tariff setting periods.

2.1.5.	Each company’s incentive to out-perform the performance standards in the MYTO will be based on its own costs and productivity considerations.

2.1.6.	At the commencement of the Methodology all prices will be regulated but this will be reduced over time as competition increases in the market and electricity supply is sufficient to meet requirements. The major parts of the electricity in-dustry are generation, transmission and distribution and retailing. These parts will be regulated as follows—

2.1.7.	Generation— will be subject to vesting contracts in the transition stage. The Vesting Contracts will set prices to be received by all generators who do not currently hold Power Purchase Agreements. Eventually, when the industry ma-tures, generation prices will not be regulated.

2.1.8.	Transmission—will remain a monopoly and will be subject to tariff regulation. However, all generators will enjoy open access and transparent pricing. The building blocks approach will be applied to produce a long term tariff path for transmission services.

2.1.9.	Distribution—is also treated as a monopoly and its prices will be regulated, again using the building blocks approach.

2.1.10.	Until the time that retail choice is introduced, retail sales and marketing will also be regulated as part of distribution and a building blocks approach will be applied to all of the distribution companies’ activities.

2.1.11.	In the Transition and Medium Term market phases, therefore, the MYTO derives a tariff for transmission and distribution/marketing using a building blocks approach as well as prices for generation under vesting contracts. Brought to-gether, these three components combine to produce an end-user tariff.

Treatment of Capital Costs in MYTO

2.2.1.	Capital Cost

2.2.1.1.	Two out of the three building blocks provide a return of, and to capital invested. In a very capital intensive industry like electricity supply it is important that the cost of capital is recognised and that new capital investment is allowed a reasonable return. If it is not, new investment will be discouraged and future demand will not be met. In this case Regulation will have done more harm than good.

2.2.1.2.	The initial value of the assets is rolled forward each year. Deprecia-tion reduces the valuation and new capital expenditure increases it, Replacement costs, actual capacity ratings and remaining economic life were taken into account in this valuation.

2.2.1.3.	The cost of capital under a building blocks approach comprises two components: the return of capital (that is, depreciation) and the return on capital (measured by the cost of capital). The capital stock to which both of these are applied is the annual asset values of the electricity supply industry - the rolled forward asset value.

2.2.1.4.	The allowed return on capital is aimed at providing appropriate in-centives for future investment. Thus, in all building block regimes, the cost of capital is provided to all approved new investment under the regime. This is typically done via the mechanism of rolling forward new investment into the regulatory asset base.

2.2.2.1.	Treatment of Depreciation in MYTO

The depreciation method to be used for the calculation of future tariffs will be the optimised depreciated replacement cost (ODRC) method. This involves—

(a)	adjusting the cost of an asset from the year of its purchase to the year of the tariff calculation;

(b)	optimising its capacity (i.e. this usually means excluding any unnecessary expenditure or over-building); and

(c)	applying depreciation over the economic life of the indi-vidual asset or groups of assets.

2.22.2.	In Nigeria all of the available electricity assets are generally used to their maximum capacity and NERC does not envisage reducing the value of existing assets through the optimization process. The MYTO is to be operated in this way for some time until the Nigerian electricity market matures.

2.2.23.	Depreciation for regulatory purposes will be applied to each group of assets so that, to the maximum extent that is reasonable, it reflects the remaining economic life of the asset or group of assets.

2.2.2A.	Within the life of the MYTO it would also be reasonable to assume that the economic life of assets that will be in the competitive part of the electricity supply industry, such as generation, will equal technical life. The rationale for this is that at present generation, transmission or distribution capacity are in short supply and there is a strong likelihood of high demand growth once a reliable

electricity supply is offered.





Treatment of the Cost of Capital (the Weighted Average Cost of Capital)

2.2.3.1. The cost of capital is a key input into the determination of tariffs,

2.23.2.	since the return on existing and new assets is a significant element of the revenue requirement of the electricity business.

The basis for estimating the cost of capital for a utility business is the cost of capital that would be required by a privately owned business with similar risk characteristics. The cost of capital used by NERC in calculating electricity tariffs is the estimated weighted average cost of capital (WACC)-using an estimation of the cost of equity and a cost of debt which reflects bond finance costs.

2.233.	Instead of applying different returns to different components of capital, such as debt and equity, a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) recognises that lenders and equity investors require different rates of return because of the different risks they face. The WACC aggregates these returns, and weighs each according to the estimated percentages of debt and equity in the industry.





Treatment of Operational Expenses in MYTO

2.3.1.	The initial operating costs used in calculating the tariff will be those gathered from the Nigerian electricity industry from 2000 to 2006.

2.3.2.	Operation and maintenance costs are assumed to include an allowance for the improved performance required under the performance indicators which will be included in the MYTO. A number of items of plant are currently out of service for want of maintenance. The repair or replacement of these units would improve supply and reduce the quantity of unserved energy. In the future, the use of spinning reserve units, which would reduce the number and duration of outages, might also involve slightly higher operating costs. The MYTO would acknowledge that these costs were required to provide a reliable service.

2.3.3.	It is expected that operation, maintenance, management and staff costs may be higher initially and the tariff calculation will include the assumption that an additional sum for operation and maintenance costs will be needed each year. In the short term the tariff calculation will include an allowance for overheads (administration, central stores and other centralised functions).

2.3.4.	The assumptions in the MYTO concerning the electricity industry’s ability to collect sales revenue will begin at current low levels but will be assumed to improve over the first five years, coinciding with an increase in metering rollout and billing expenditure.

Pricing Generation in MYTO

3.1.	The most pressing issue in the electricity sector is the shortage of generation capacity to meet demand. Exacerbating this under-investment in capacity, a high proportion of the electricity supply industry’s generation capacity is unusable through lack of maintenance (plant availability is below sixty per cent) and reinvestment. This situation is being ad-dressed in part by the current network building program aimed at increasing capacity to 10,000 MW by the end of 2010.

3.2.	The current structure of the generation sector is characterised by a large, dominant government-owned business together with a small presence from independent power producers (IPPs). This is expected to change as the industry is transformed in the coming years and the MYTO has the flexibility to cope with this change.

3.3.	Securing new investment in generation capacity through the establishment of private sec-tor participation in a competitive energy market is a major part of the overall reform vision for the Nigerian electricity supply industry. Once the industry has reached the ‘steady-state’ stage, it is intended that generation will operate within a commercial environment, with generators entering into commercial bilateral contracts with distributors. Ultimately, the price of wholesale electricity will be market based and be reflected in the final tariff to users (and included with the regulated transmission and distribution charges, the costs of retail functions, and other costs).

3.4.	Moving from the current arrangements to the final stage of a competitive wholesale market for energy will not happen overnight. One essential precondition is the attainment of a sufficient number of private suppliers into the industry. A second is the removal of the huge supply deficit.

3.5.	The main objectives in setting bulk electricity prices in vesting contracts are to cover the costs of existing plant and allow for their efficient maintenance and ongoing investment programmes while ensuring that an appropriate incentive exists for new entry generation. 

For this reason the appropriate price for bulk electricity supplied by generators under vesting contracts is the unit price an efficient new plant would require in the Nigerian electricity supply industry.

3.6.	The strategy for managing the transition to a competitive wholesale market includes the use of vesting contracts for generators. Vesting contracts have been used in many coun-tries as a means to manage the transition to a competitive market.

Pricing Transmission in MYTO

4.1.	Transmission charges in the MYTO will have the following components—

(a)	a connection charge for new generators that covers their costs in connecting to the high voltage network;

(b)	the covering of transmission losses at different connection points on the network by generators injecting enough power to cover their contracted amounts plus the associated transmission losses; and

(c)	a charge on distributors per unit of energy taken from the high voltage system at the bulk supply points.

4.2.	The connection charge above will be a once only charge to cover the costs of transmission infrastructure required to connect a new power station to the transmission network. It will vary according to how much capital expenditure is required and how far the power station is from the existing network.

4.3.	The second charge above relates to the cost of transmission losses, Transmission systems lose eight per cent of the energy injected into them through heating and leakage. Genera-tors will effectively pay for these losses by injecting a sufficient amount in excess of their contracted amounts to cover the losses associated with their sales. For example, if the losses associated with their injection point are eight per cent, they will be required to inject one hundred and eight per cent of their sales volumes in each settlement period.

4.4.	The transmission tariff to be levied on distribution companies is based on a building blocks methodology, although the costs associated with losses from the network is not in-cluded in the calculation as this component will be covered by the generators.

4.5.	The charges have been designed in this way so that—

(a)	electricity generators see an incentive to locate reasonably close to the transmis-sion network as they will pay the costs of connection;

(b)	electricity generators will also see an incentive to locate at places on the network where losses are low. Such points are typically near load centres or at the end of long transmission lines to isolated load centres; and

(c)	electricity distributors effectively pay for the capital cost of the distribution system as well as operation and maintenance.

Pricing Distribution and Retailing

5.1.	Distribution tariffs are similar in a number of respects to transmission tariffs. Most of the cost of the distribution network arises from the capital expenditure needed to build and maintain it. The most useful guide to the future level of necessary capital expenditure comes from the forecasts of peak demand for each electricity distributor. Distributors would likely grow at different rates and their capital needs will therefore vary.

El-211 

5.2.	The Distribution Use of System (DUOS) tariff will cover the cost of distribution and marketing. DUOS charges are calculated according to the building blocks methodology and include allowances for capital expenditure, operation and maintenance of the network, losses across the distribution networks and metering costs.

5.3.	These costs are included in the MYTO along with the operating and administration costs of retailing and billing electricity sales.

5.4.	At the first five-year review, the Commission will gather information from the distribution companies on the reliability and quality of the supply that they deliver.

Why a Multi-Year Tariff Methodology?

6.1.	The Multi-Year Tariff Methodology provides a stable price path into the future. The tariffs will be reviewed each year by the Commission but will only be varied according to varying rates of inflation, the cost of input fuel for electricity and exchange rate fluctuations.

6.2.	The major five-yearly tariff review will consider each of the input assumptions for the tariff model in order to update them to appropriate current values.

6.3.	Major reviews will be undertaken at less than five year intervals if industry participants can demonstrate to Commission that industry parameters have changed from those used in the Methodology to such an extent that a review is required urgently to maintain industry vi-ability.

6.4.	At the commencement of the major five-year review, NERC will prepare a consultation paper that will indicate the issues to be covered. The Commission will inform those parties who will be regulated by the review what information is required from each of them. All regulated electricity operators will be the major source of information on the industry. As part of the regulatory process they will be required to provide verifiable information on a uniform reporting and accounting basis regarding their regulated operations on matters such as—

6.3.	Major reviews will be undertaken at less than five year intervals if industry participants can demonstrate to Commission that industry parameters have changed from those used in the Methodology to such an extent that a review is required urgently to maintain industry viability.

6.4.	At the commencement of the major five-year review, NERC will prepare a consultation paper that will indicate the issues to be covered. The Commission will inform those parties who will be regulated by the review what information is required from each of them. All regulated electricity operators will be the major source of information on the industry. As part of the regulatory process they will be required to provide verifiable information on a uniform reporting and accounting basis regarding their regulated operations on matters such as—

(a)	capital expenditure;

(b)	actual and projected sales;

(c)	operating costs;

(d)	fuel costs; and

(e)	taxes and other payments.

6.5.	While NERC will be informed by the industry’s views on a number of matters it will develop its own analysis and conclusions on important parameters. These include: forecasts of electricity demand, interest rates and a reasonable industry WACC, appropriate expansion of the transmission and distribution networks and reasonable annual rates of reduction of industry losses, particularly non-technical losses. 

6.6.	A five-yearly Review is likely to take about twelve months. It will be commenced more than one year before the beginning of the new five-year tariff period.

6.7.	In the initial years the tariff path also allows the industry some time to ramp up gradually to appropriate tariff levels, avoiding a large step change in one year.

6.8.	A long term tariff path also reduces some of the risks for both major electricity consumers and investors in the industry. While they do not know the exact level of future tariffs they know how they will be calculated and that they will be reasonably consistent between the five year reviews.

4.2.3.	Short Circuit Contribution to the TSP Transmission Network—

(a)	General.—To allow the TSP and System Operator to calculate fault currents, each

User’s is required to provide data, calculated in accordance with best international practice as set out in this Code.

The data should be provided from the User’s System with all Generating Units Synchronised to that User’s System. The User must ensure that the pre-fault net-work conditions reflect a credible System operating arrangement.

The list of data items required, in whole or part under the following provisions is set out in 4.2.4. The fault currents in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) of the data list in 4.2.4 should be based on a.c. load flow that takes into account any pre-fault current flow across the point of connection being considered.

Where prospective short-circuit currents on equipment owned, operated or man-aged by the TSP are close to the equipment rating, and in TSP or System Operator reasonable opinion more accurate calculations of the prospective short circuit cur-rents are required, then the TSP may request additional short circuit data. 

(b)	Data from Directly Connected Customers.—Directly Connected Customers at each node on the Single Line Diagram provided to the TSP shall provide motor loads and/or Embedded Small Power Stations and other installations of direct current converters which do not form a DC converter Station assuming a fault at that location, as follows—

The data items listed under the following parts of 4.2.4—

(a)	(i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v) and (vi).

And the data items shall be provided in accordance to detailed provisions of 4.2.4. (c) to 0).

(c)	Data from User's Generating Unit in a Power Station.—For User’s each Generating Unit in a power Station, with one or more associated Unit Transformer(s), the User is required to provide values for the contribution of the Power Station Auxiliaries (including Auxiliary Gas Turbine or Auxiliary Diesel Engines) to the fault current flowing through the Unit Transformer(s). The data items listed under the following parts of subsection 4.2.4 (a) should be provided—

(i)	, (ii) and (v).

(iii)	if the associated Generating Unit step-up transformer can supply zero phase sequence current from the Generating Unit side to the Transmission Network.

(iv)	if the value is not 1.0 p.u.

The data item shall be provided in accordance with the provisions of sub-section 4.2.4 (c) to (/).

Auxiliary motor short circuit contribution and any Auxiliary Gas Turbine Unit contribution through the Unit Transformers must be represented as a combined short circuit current contribution at the Generating Unit’s terminals, assuming a fault at that location.

If the User’s Power Station has separate Station Transformers, data should be provided for the fault current contribution from each transformer at its high voltage terminals, assuming a fault at that location as follows—

The data items listed under the following parts of 4.2.4.

O) (i) to (vi).

And the data items shall be provided in accordance with the detailed provi-sions of 4.2.4. (b) to (f).

Data for the fault infeeds through both Unit and Station Transformers shall be provided for the normal running arrangement when the maximum number of Generating Units are Synchronised to the Network. Where there is an alternative running arrangement which can give higher fault infeed through the Station Transformers, then a separate data submission representing this condition shall be made.

No account should be taken of the interconnection between the Station and Unit Board, unless the normal operating arrangement within the Power Station is to have the Station and Unit Boards interconnected within the Power Stations.

Auxiliary motor short circuit current contribution through the Station Transformers must be represented as a combined short circuit contribution through the Station Transformers.

4.2.4.	Data Items:	*

(a)	Below is the list of data utilised in this part of the Planning Code. It also contains rules on the data which generally apply—

(i)	Root mean square of the symmetrical three-phase short circuit current in- feed at the instant of fault (II”);

(ii)	Root mean square of the symmetrical three-phase short circuit current after the subtransient fault current contribution has substantially decayed (II ’);

(iii)	The zero sequence source resistance and reactance values of the User’s Equipment as seen from node on the Single Line diagram provided under

4.2.1	(or Station Transformer high voltage terminals or Generating Unit terminals as appropriate) consistent with the infeed describe in 4.2.1;

(iv)	Root mean square of the pre-fault voltage at which the maximum fault cur-rents were calculated;

(v)	The positive sequence X/R ratio at the instant of fault;

(vi)	The negative sequence resistance and reactance values of the User’s Gen-erating unit seen from node on the Single Line diagram provided under

4.2.1	(or Station Transformer high voltage terminals, or Generating Unit terminals if appropriate) if substantially different from the values of positive sequence resistance and reactance which would be derived from the data provided above.

(b)	In considering this data, unless the User notifies TCN accordingly at the time of data submission, TCN will assume that the time constant of decay of die subtransient fault current corresponding to the change from II' to II’ (T”) is not significantly different from 40ms. The User must inform TCN if the assumption is not correct in relation to an item of data.

(c)	The value for X/R ratio must reflect the rate of decay of the d.c. component that may be present in the fault current and hence that of the sources of the initial fault current. All shunt elements and loads must therefore be deleted from any system model before the X/R ratio is calculated.

(d)	In producing the data, the User may use 'time step analysis' or 'fixed-point-in- time analysis' with different impedances.

(e)	If a fixed-in-time analysis with different impedances method is used, then in relation to the data submitted under (a) (i) above, the data will be required for 'time zero' to give II”. The figure of 120ms is consistent with a decay time constant T' of 40ms, and if that figure is different, then the figure of 120ms must be changed accordingly.

(f)	Where a 'time step analysis' is carried out, the X/R ratio may be calculated directly from the rate of the d.c. component. The X/R ratio is not that given by the phase angle of the fault current if this is based on a system calculation with shunt loads, but from the Thevenin equivalent of the System impedance at the instant of fault with all non-source shunts removed.

They also set out the procedures by which the Transmission Service Provider (TSP) will process an application to connection to the Transmission System, seeking to ensure compliance with these criteria as a requirement for the granting of approval for the connection of a User to the Transmission System.

1.1.2.	The provisions of the Connection Conditions shall apply to all connections to the Trans-mission Network—

(a)	existing at the date when this Grid Code comes into effect;

(b)	existing at the date of commencement of the TSP’s approval, where these dates precede the date in (a) above; and

(c)	as established or modified thereafter.

1.1.3.	The Connection Conditions are designed to ensure that—

(a)	No new or modified connection will impose unacceptable effects upon the Trans-mission System or on any User network nor will it be subject itself to unacceptable effects by its connection to the Transmission System.

(b)	The basic rules for connection treat all Users, within an equivalent category, in a non-discriminatory fashion.

Purpose

1.2.1.	The purpose of this Connection Conditions is—

(a)	to specify the technical, design, and operational criteria at each Connection Point;

(b)	to ensure that there is no undue discrimination in the application of the Grid Code

between Users or classes of User;

(c)	to facilitate the use of the Transmission System by any User connected to or seeking connection to the Transmission System, in accordance with a Connection Agreement;

(d)	to define the requirements for a User seeking connection and/or for a modification of the current connection;

(e)	to enable the TSP to develop, maintain and operate the Transmission System in a

coordinated and economic manner in compliance with its licence.

Scope

1.3.1.	The Connection Conditions apply to the System Operator, TSP and to Users of the Transmission System which in this Connection Conditions are—

(a)	Power Stations;

(b)	Distributors;

(c)	Interconnected Parties;

(d)	Customers connected to the Transmission System.

2.	Transmission System Performance Characteristics

Frequency and Voltage

2.1.1.	In order to maintain the security and integrity of the Transmission System it is necessary that the System Operator operate the Transmission System and Dispatch it in such a manner in order to provide adequate Frequency Control so as to achieve operation within applicable Frequency limits at all times.

2.1.2.	The nominal Frequency of the system will be 50 Hz. The National Control Centre will endeavour to control the System Frequency within a narrow operating band of + 0.5% from 50 Hz, but under System Stress the Frequency on the Power System could experience variations within the limits of 50 Hz ± 2.5% (48.75— 51.25 Hz).

2.1.3.	All equipment and apparatus connected directly or indirectly to the National Grid must operate at 50Hz frequency mode.

2.1.4.	Under extreme system fault conditions all Generating Units should disconnect by following frequencies unless agreed otherwise in writing with the System Operator—

(a)	By a frequency greater than or equal to [51.75] Hz.

(b)	By a frequency less than or equal to [48.5] Hz.

2.1.5.	The System Operator shall endeavour to control the different busbar voltages to be within the Voltage Control ranges specified in Table 1:

Voltage Level	Minimum Voltage kV (pu)	Maximum Voltage kV (pu)

330 kV	313.5 (0.95)	346.5 (1.05)

132 kV	118.8(0.9)	145.0(1.098)

33 kV	31 (0.94)	34.98(1.06)

16 kV	15.2 (0.95)	16.8(1.05)

11 kV	10.45 (0.95)	11.55 (1.05)





Table 1: Voltage Control ranges

Under System Stress or following system faults, voltages can be expected to deviate outside the above limits by a further ± 5% (excluding transient and sub-transient disturbances)

2.1.6.	Due to the effect of travelling waves on the Transmission Network as a result of atmospheric disturbances or the switching of long transmission lines, transient over-voltage can occur at certain node points of the network concerned. The insulation level of all Apparatus must be coordinated to take account of transient over-voltages and sensitive User equipment, such as computer and other solid state equipment, should be suitably isolated from this effect.

2.1.7.	The transient over-voltage during lightning strikes is typically experienced over a voltage range of + 20% of nominal voltage. Connection Points close to a network lightning strike will experience voltages higher than this.

2.1.8.	Unless otherwise agreed by the TSP, the Basic Insulation Value (BIV) for User Apparatus shall be as follows—

(a)	For the 330 kV system, the BIV is 1300 kV.

(b)	For the 132 kV system, the BIV is 650 kV.

Voltage Perturbations

2.2.1.	'Voltage Flicker' is a rapid change in voltage that is typically caused by User equipment that distorts or interferes with the normal sinusoidal voltage waveform of the Transmission System. Such interference is a product of a relatively large current inrush when Apparatus, such as a large motor, is suddenly switched on, or resulting from the sudden increased de-mand from for example welding equipment. Such distortions can disturb Users equipment and cause, for instance through flickering lights, consumer annoyance. The current inrush acting over the network impedance is the mechanism that produces the voltage dip (sudden fall) and the corresponding voltage swell (sudden rise) when the Apparatus concerned is offloaded. Hence, the cause of the 'Voltage Flicker”.

2.2.2.	Users are required to minimise the occurrence of Voltage Flicker on the Transmission System as measured at the User’s Connection Point. The Flicker Severity at the Connection Point of any User, shall not be above the maximum values stated in IEC 61000-3 Standard for more than 3% of the period. The maximum emission limits produced by any User shall be below the maximum values stated in IEC 61000-3 Standard,

2.2.3.	In cases where, in the reasonable opinion of the System Operator, variations in generation or demand constitute a risk to Transmission System operation, strict conformity with the IEC 61000-3-7 flicker curve will be required.

2.2.4.	Harmonics are normally produced by User’s Apparatus generating waveforms that distort the fundamental 50 Hz wave. Such harmonic generation can damage User Apparatus and can result in failure of Transmission System Apparatus. The limits for harmonic distortion levels are given in the following documents—

(a)	EN 50160:2000 'Voltage characteristics of electricity supplied by public distribution systems”.

(b)	IEC/TR3 61000-3-6 (1996) 'Assessment of emission limits for distorting loads in MV and HV power systems”. 

2.2.5.	In general, the maximum total levels of harmonic distortion on the System under Normal Operation conditions, planned outages and fault outage conditions (unless during System Stress) shall not exceed following values—

(a)	330 kV a Total Harmonic Distortion of 1.5 per cent with no individual harmonic greater than 1 per cent

(b)	132 kV a Total Harmonic Distortion of 2 per cent with no individual harmonic greater of 1.5 per cent.

2.2.6.	Under Normal Operation, the maximum negative phase sequence component of the phase voltage of the Transmission System should remain below 1 per cent.

2.2.7.	Under planned outage conditions, infrequent short duration peaks with a maximum value of 2 per cent are permitted for phase unbalance.

If the TSP has to redo or perform additional system studies then the User shall also bear the costs reasonably incurred as a result of the said additional work.

Process of the Application

3.2.1.	The TSP shall establish a procedure for the processing of applications for connection or modification of an existing connection to the Transmission System, which shall include the time frames required to process the application and to submit the User an offer for connection. This procedure will be approved by the NERC.

3.2.2.	System Studies.—Based on the data supplied by the User, the TSP will coordinate with the System Operator to perform the system impact studies required to evaluate in detail the impact of the proposed User development on the Transmission System. (The magnitude and complexity of any Transmission System extension or reinforcement varies according to the nature, location and timing of the proposed User(s) development.).

3.2.3.	User(s) Studies.—Upon request of the User, the TSP shall provide to the User adequate and sufficient information regarding the Transmission System, to enable the User conduct Impact Studies on the User’s system, and/or the Transmission System it considers appropriate.

3.2.4.	Plant Parameters.—The User(s) shall provide the TSP with all the relevant Plant or Ap-paratus parameters as required from Appendices 5, 6 and 7 before TCN shall proceed with the above-mentioned System studies.

3.2.5.	During the application for connection process, based on the results of the System Studies, the TSP will agree with the User the voltage level and point of connection to the Transmission System. The TSP may, eventually, specify a different Connection Point or connection voltage in order to avoid potential disturbance caused by the User’s Equipment to other Users of the Transmission System or for other technical reasons, or may agree alternative methods for minimising the effects of disturbing loads.

3.2.6.	In determining the point of connection, including the voltage level, following aspects shall to be taken into consideration—

4.6.4.	Each Generating Unit shall be required to withstand, without tripping, the negative phase sequence loading experienced during clearance of a close-up phase-to-phase fault, by System back-up protection on the Transmission Network.

4.6.5.	The System frequency could rise to 51.5 Hz or fall to 47.5 Hz and Generating Units must continue to operate within this frequency range unless the System Operator has agreed to any frequency-level relays and/or rate-of-change-of-frequency relays which shall trip such Generating Units within this frequency range, as stated in the Connection Agreement.

Power Producers shall be responsible for protecting all their Generating Units against damage should System frequency variations exceed 51.5 Hz or go below 47.5 Hz or such limits agreed with the System Operator. In the event that such variations occur, the Power Producer shall disconnect the Generating Unit for reasons of safety of personnel, Appara-tus, and/or Plant.

Protection Arrangements

4.6.8.	Electrical protection of the Generating Unit shall take precedence over operational controls (e.g. Voltage Controllers, excitation equipment) and the Generating Unit shall disconnect from the network should unacceptable Operational States arise as a result of failure of the operational controls. This shall apply in particular when spontaneous faults occur (e.g. earth faults, short-circuits).

4.6.9.	The settings for the electrical protective equipment must be agreed upon between the System Operator and the Power Station, and reflected in the Connection Agreement. The possibility of protective and switchgear failures must also be taken into account. Consid-eration must be given to the following points—

2.	Frequency Control and Operating Reserve

2.1.1.	The objectives of this section are—

Objective

(a)	To specify the System Operator requirements to ensure that adequate Frequency Control capability is provided on the Transmission System to enable operational Frequency Control by the System Operator, so as to achieve the applicable limits, and

(b)	To specify the Operating Reserve and Reliability Must-run requirements the System Operator has to adhere to in order to achieve the mentioned Frequency Control and adequate system reliability.

General

2.2.1.	In order to maintain the security and integrity of the Transmission System it is necessary that the System Operator operate the Transmission System and Dispatch it in such a manner in order to provide adequate Frequency Control so as to achieve operation within applicable Frequency limits at all times. Frequency Control can be obtained by using primary or secondary Frequency Control.

2.2.2.	Depending on network condition, generators will be required to move to or from Frequency Sensitive mode in combinations agreed in the relevant Ancillary Services Agreement or in-structed by the System Operator.

2.2.3.	In order to achieve this Control, the System Operator shall operate the System with ade-quate Operating. Operating Reserve is additional Active Power output provided from Generation Plant, or a reduction in consumer Demand, which must be realisable in realtime operation to contain and correct any potential Transmission System Frequency deviation to an acceptable level.

Operating Reserve is required to secure capacity that will be available for reliable and secure balancing of supply and demand.

Frequency limits

2.3.1.	The Frequency shall be scheduled at 50 Hz. The National Control Centre will endeavour to control the System Frequency within a narrow operating band of + 0.5% from 50 Hz, at least for 90 per cent of the time during Normal Conditions. Under System Stress the Frequency Control on the Power System will be exercised within the limits of 50 Hz + 2.5% (48.75-51.25 Hz).

Frequency Control

2.4.1.	During Normal Conditions.—Frequency Control will be exercised utilizing the Spinning Reserve (Primary and Secondary Reserve). Occasionally, also the Emergency Reserve will be used.

2.4.2.	The Nigerian Power System requires minimum of 600 MW of Spinning Reserve power to secure the network—

(a)	The System Operator shall distribute the required Spinning Reserve power among

the contributing Generating Units.

(b)	The Generators shall be responsible for continuous secure maintenance of their primary Frequency Control equipment as instructed by the System Operator.

1.	Shortfall.—The System Operator shall evaluate the Frequency Control performance during the day of operation and identify any shortfall. The System Operator shall instruct a Generator(s) to perform Frequency Control to counteract the shortfall.

Components of Operating Reserve

2.5.1.	There are two types of Operating Reserve namely Quick Reserve and Slow Reserve.

2.5.2.	Quick Reserve.—is the reserve that can respond within ten seconds and be fully active within thirty minutes of activation. This Reserve is used for second-by-second balancing of supply and demand, and to restore frequency to nominal values following a disturbance. Quick Reserve shall consist of Spinning Reserve and Emergency Reserve

(a)	Spinning Reserve.—Spinning reserve is the additional output from synchronised Generating Unit, which must be realisable to respond to containing and restoring 

any frequency deviation to an acceptable level in the event of a loss of generation or a mismatch between generation output and demand. The Spinning Reserve from the Generating Unit must be capable of providing response in two distinct ways and time scales: Primary Reserve and Secondary Reserve—

(i)	Primary Reserve.—Primary Reserve is an automatic increase/decrease in Active Power output of a Generation Unit in response to a System frequency fall/rise, in accordance with the primary control capability and additional mechanisms for acquiring active power. This change in active power output must be in accordance with the technical characteristics and loading of the Generation Unit, without any time delays other than those necessarily inher-ent in the design of the Governor Control System.

(ii)	Secondary Reserve.—Secondary reserve is the automatic response to fre-quency changes which is fully available by thirty seconds from the time of frequency change to take over from the Primary Reserve, and which is sus-tainable for a period of at least thirty minutes.

(b)	Emergency Reserve.—Emergency Reserve is typically made up from contracted

interruptible load, gas turbines and emergency generation. Emergency Reserve is a less frequently used reserve and is used when the Transmission Network is not in a normal condition and to return the Transmission Network to normal conditions while slower reserves are being activated. The Reserve can be used by the System Operator for supply and demand balancing, network stability and voltage con-straints. This Reserve shall be activated, on request, within ten minutes and shall be sustainable for two hours.

2.5.3.	Slow Reserve.—Slow Reserve is the component of the Operating Reserve not connected to the Transmission System but capable of serving demand within a specified time. Slow Reserve is used to restore Quick Reserve when required. Slow Reserve shall consist of Hot Standby and Cold Reserve.

(a)	Hot Standby.—Hot Standby is a condition of readiness in relation to any Genera-tion Unit that is declared available, where it is ready to be synchronise and attain an instructed load within thirty minutes, and subsequently maintained such load continuously.

(b)	Cold Standby.—Cold Standby is a condition of readiness in relation to any Genera-tion Unit that is declared available, to start, synchronise and attain target loading within a pre-defmed period of time, typically within up to twelve hours.

Operating Reserve Policy

2.6.1.	The System Operator shall, in consultation with the other Users, specify the Operating Reserve policies, including its allocation of the permissible mix of Spinning and Quick Reserve, and procedure for applying Operating Reserve in practice, and the limitations, if any, upon the amount of Interruptible Load which may be included. The System Operator shall submit the Operating Reserve policy to the NERC for approval.

2.6.2.	In developing the Operating Reserve Policy, due consideration shall be taken of relevant factors, including, but not limited to the following—

(a)	The cost of providing Operating Reserve at any point in time;

(b)	The magnitude and number of the largest Generation in-feeds to the Transmission System at that time, including in-feeds over Interconnections and also over single Transmission feeders within the Transmission System;

(c)	Ambient weather conditions, insofar as they may affect (directly or indirectly) Generating Unit and/or Transmission System Reliability;

(d)	The predicted Frequency drop on loss of the largest in-feed as determined through simulation using a dynamic model of the Power System;

(e)	Constraints imposed by Agreements in place with externally interconnected parties;

(f)	Historical Availability and Reliability performance of individual Generating Units;

(g)	Notified risk to the Reliability of individual Generating Units; and

(h)	Demand Forecasting uncertainties.

2.6.3.	Unless proved to be technically impossible, or the economic burden imposed on the dis-patch cost excessive, the Operating Reserve Policy shall be developed under following premises—

(a)	Primary Reserve.—It shall be ensured that enough primary reserve is available to maintain system frequency within acceptable limits, following a contingency such as a unit trip or a sudden surge in load, without any under-frequency load shedding.

The frequency shall stabilize above 49.00Hz following all credible single contingency loss. The largest single unit loss permissible is 220 MW (classified as a major incident).

(b)	Spinning Reserve.—It shall be ensured to keep the frequency above 48.75 Hz after credible multiple contingencies, considering adequate operation of the under-frequency load shedding scheme, currently being the loss of 660 MW generation (typically loss of a major hydro station).

(c)	The minimum Operating Reserve shall be sufficient to cover 150 per cent of the loss of the sent-out capacity of the largest Generating Unit in service at that time. If two Generating Units are connected to the Transmission Network via one common Gen-eration transformer, the sum of the two Generating Units’ sent-out capacity shall be used as the largest Generating Unit.

(d)	Operating Reserve mix.—The mix of Operating Reserve shall be as follows—

(i)	An amount of Spinning Reserve, responsive to AGC, which is sufficient to provide Normal Regulating Margin; plus

(ii)	An additional amount of Operating Reserve sufficient to reduce Area Control Error to zero within ten minutes following loss of generating capacity which would result from the most severe single contingency. Interruptible Load may be included in the Quick Reserve provided that it can be interrupted within ten minutes and can remain off until replacement Generation can be made available;

(iii)	At least 50 per cent of these Operating Reserves shall be spinning and the other 50 per cent shall be Quick Reserve;

(e)	Operating Reserve shall be dispersed throughout the system and shall consider the

effective use of capacity in an emergency, time required to be effective, transmission limitations, and local area requirements.

2.6.4.	The System Operator shall, in consultation with the other Users, review probable contin-gencies frequently to determine the adequacy of Operating Reserve Policy, maintain it permanently under review. On an annual basis, it shall submit to the NERC an amended version for approval, taking into consideration the previous year’s Frequency recovery performance.

(b)	The System Operator shall keep proper records of the Availability of its transmission resources.

(c)	The System Operator shall have information, including weather forecasts and past Load patterns, available to predict the Transmission System’s future Load.

2.7.4.	The System Operator shall operate the Transmission System to provide for a level of Op-erating Reserve sufficient to account for such factors as errors in forecasting, generation and Transmission Equipment unavailability, number and size of Generating Units, system Equipment Forced Outage rates, maintenance schedules and regulating requirements. The System Operator shall take appropriate steps to protect the Power System against the next contingency, following the loss of Generation resources or Load.

(e)	When the System Operator decides to implement frequency regulation under AGG

control, following rules shall apply—

(i)	The AGC shall act as a secondary Frequency Control device and shall raise or lower the Generating Unit output according to an economic analysis of the participating Generating Units. This economic analysis takes the registered operating characteristics of Generating Units, Generator Nominations, Transmission System losses and Availability of plant into account to determine optimal Generating Unit output;

(ii)	The System Operator shall ensure the balance between Generation and the Load. The System Operator shall achieve this by the deployment of secon-dary Frequency Control (AGC);

4.	Black Start

Objective

4.1.1.	The objective of this section is to stipulate the Black Start requirements the System Op-erator has to cater for.

General

4.2.1.	Generating Units have to be identified that can start on own resources from a total de-energised state which may be due to emergency condition declared by System Operator as in section 6 of the Operational Code or Appendix 9 of this Code. Such Generating Units may be necessary to start other Generating Units and revive the Power System following a Total Shutdown. The necessary contracts must be closed between the System Operator and Generators to provide Black Start Capability and appropriate tests must be done on a regular basis to ensure that the Power System can be reactivated following such an extreme emergency situation.

Ancillary Service

4.3.1.	Black Start is an Ancillary Service. The System Operator shall contract for Black Start to enable it to operate the Transmission System securely at all times.

Requirements

4.4.1.	The System Operator shall set out the requirements for Black Start Stations to enable recovery of the Transmission System from a Partial Shutdown or Total Shutdown.

4.4.2.	Requirements for Black Start Stations—

(a)	Black Start Stations shall have the ability for at least one of its Generating Units to start-up from shutdown and to energise a part of the total system, or be Synchro-nised to the System.

(b)	The Black Start Stations shall perform Black Start upon instruction from the System Operator, without an external electrical power supply.

(c)	The Black Start Power Station shall inform the System Operator if during the Demand restoration process any Black Start unit cannot, because of the Demand being experienced, keep within its safe operating parameters. 

(d)	The System Operator shall where possible, either instruct Demand to be altered or will re-configure the Transmission System or will instruct a Participant to reconfigure its system in order to alleviate the problem being experienced by the Generator.

(e)	However, System Operator will accepts a suitable decision to keep a Generating Unit in a Power Station operate outside its safe operating parameters, for a limited period of time. The System Operator shall accept that the Generator operator may change Generation on that unit if it believes it is necessary for safety reasons. The Generator shall inform the System Operator as soon as reasonably practical if such a change is made without prior notice.

5.	Emergency Operation and Restoration

Objective

5.1.1.	The objective of this section is to outline the general restoration strategy, which shall be adopted by the System Operator in the event of a Partial or Total Shutdown of the Transmission System emergency condition or that indicated in Appendix 8. This includes the need for a restoration plan and an under Frequency Load shedding scheme.

General

5.2.1.	The Operating States of a Power System are classified into five Operating States, namely normal, alert, emergency, in extreme and restorative.

5.2.2.	The different Operating States can be defined as follows—

(a)	Normal Operating State.—The Power System variables, voltage and lines, are within the normal range and no equipment is being overloaded. The Power System operates in a secure manner and can withstand any single contingency without violating any of the limits.

The Power System should be in this mode of operation for most of the time. The System Operator shall endeavour to operate the Power System such that it is in the normal Operating State.

(b)	Alert Operating State.—The Power System will move into this state of operation once the security level falls below a certain limit. This could also be due to the possibility of a disturbance due to bad weather conditions, such as a severe storm.

The Power System variables, voltage and lines, are within acceptable operating range and limits. However, the Power System is weakened and the next contingency could cause an overload or voltage violation. Emergency operating state.

The Power System will move into this state of operation if a severe disturbance occurs or under a civil emergency situation as in Appendix 8, when the system is in the alert operating state. Some of the busbar voltages will be low and/or equipment will exceed its short-term emergency ratings. The system will still be intact and can return to the alert Operating State once the emergency actions have been initiated, such as fault clearing, excitation control, generating tripping and Load curtailment.

(c)	Extreme Operating State.—The Power System will move into this state of operation once the emergency actions have failed to be effective. This will result in a possible cascade tripping of the transmission lines and Generators and a possible

Shutdown of a part of the Power System. The Power System can then be saved by the initiation of under Frequency Load shedding and controlled separation of por-tions of the Power System.

(d)	 Restorative Operating State.—The System Operator shall reconnect all the facilities and restore the system Load during this Operating State either through approach in section 5 or other safe method deemed necessary by System Operator. The Operating State of the Power System will then move from Operating State to restorative state until it has once again reached again the normal Operating State.

Emergency Operation

5.3.1.	Operating States.—System Operator shall always be in a position to determine the Oper-ating State of the Power System. The System Operator shall be responsible to inform all the parties involved once the Operating State changes from one Operating State to another.

It shall include but not be limited to—

(a)	under-frequency load shedding;

(b)	meeting system disaster management requirements including the necessary minimum;

(c)	load requirements;

(d)	forced Outages at all points of interface, and

(e)	supply restoration.

5.3.3.	Emergency plans shall allow for quick and orderly recovery from a partial or complete system collapse, with least cost solution and minimum impact on customers.

5.3.4.	The System Operator shall periodically verify contingency and/or emergency plans by actual tests to the greatest practical extent possible. In the event of such tests causing un-due risk or undue cost to a User, the System Operator shall take such risks or costs into consideration when deciding whether to conduct the tests. Any tests shall be carried out at a time that is least disruptive to the User and embedded End-use Customers. The costs of these tests shall be borne by the respective asset owners. The System Operator shall ensure the co-ordination of the tests in consultation with all affected Users.

5.3.5.	The System Operator shall specify minimum emergency requirements for Distribution Control Centres, power station local control centres and substations to ensure continuous operation of their control, recording and communication facilities.

8.	Scheduling and Dispatch

Objective

8.1.1.	The objective of this section is to provide Generators with provisional running orders for the Dispatch Day such that Generating Units will be made available in the correct time scale to enable the System Operator to Dispatch them whilst maintaining the required Operating Reserve. In order to achieve the primary objective this section details the time scale for the System Operator to make specific information available to Generators and Users.

8.1.2.	A further objective of this section is to establish a framework to enable the System Operator to issue Dispatch Instructions to—

(a)	Generators with respect to their Generating Units; and

(b)	Users in relation to Ancillary Services.

Dispatch Instructions are issued such that available Generation is matched to De-mand with appropriate margin of Operating Reserve whilst maintaining the integrity and security of the Transmission System with acceptable Quality of Supply.

General

8.2.1.	The System Operator shall dispatch generators according to Market Rules, subject to constraints of safety of personnel, equipment, system security, reliability and the envi-ronmental requirements.

8.2.2.	The scheduling and Dispatch of Generating Units is necessary to ensure that the most economical combination of Generating Units possible is used for each Dispatch Period. This optimal combination of Generating Units must meet the Demand such that the nec-essary Frequency Control can be achieved.

8.2.3.	In order to achieve this, the System Operator will have to calculate the optimal combination of Generating Units on a continuous basis using specialised software suitable for this. These calculations by the System Operator are based on Day-ahead Nominations by each Generator and the anticipated Demand.

Data and Process

8.3.1.	The System Operator shall forecast the Power System Demand in accordance with Con-dition 7.4.5 that shall be used in the Dispatch process.

8.3.2.	System Operator shall set the level of Reserve that shall be used in the Dispatch process.

8.3.3.	System Operator shall include in the Dispatch Instructions the Active Power Output level of a Generating Unit, Synchronising or Desynchronising time, if appropriate and Ancillary Service to be provided.

8.3.4.	System Operator shall adjust Generation Unit Active Power Output by using a merit order based on the Day-ahead Nominations provided by Generators for each Generating Unit as variations occur due to such factors as Demand or Availability variations.

Dispatch Scheduling

8.4.1.	Production of a Dispatch Schedule.—Each day between 13:00 hours and 16:00 hours the System Operator shall produce the two Dispatch Schedules pursuant Conditions 12.4.2 and 12.4.3 for the Dispatch Day. The System Operator may produce the Dispatch Schedule more or less frequently, or reasonably delay its production in response to changes in Availability and other events that may arise. The Dispatch Schedule is utilised by the System Operator in its scheduling and in its preparation for Dispatch of Generating Units.

In preparing the Dispatch Schedule, the System Operator shall schedule Day-ahead Nominations to minimise the offered cost of meeting Load forecast according to the prin-ciples set out in section 6.3, taking into account the following factors—

(a)	Forecast Demand and geographical Demand distribution;

(b)	Generating Units’ Registered Information, including operating characteristics, Ancillary Service capability and Availability;

(c)	Generator Day-ahead Nominations, including Nominations by Hydro Generating Units;

(d)	Declared abnormal risks to Generating Units;

(e)	    Ancillary Service requirements, including Frequency Control, Operating Reserve and Voltage Control;

(f)	Reliability Must-run requirements;

(g)	Transmission System constraints, including Network and Generating Unit constraints;

(h)	Transmission System losses;

(i)	System Operator and Users’ monitoring and test requirements;

(j)	Transmission System stability implications;

(k)	Interconnector Capacity Entitlements and Interconnector Energy Trade Nominations pursuant to rule 7.10 of the Market Rules;

(l)	   Interconnection Agreements;

(m)	Other factors as may be reasonably considered by the System Operator to be relevant to the Dispatch Schedule.

8.4.2.	Pre-dispatch Day constrained Schedule.—

The System Operator shall produce a Pre-dispatch Day constrained Schedule for each Dispatch Day by 16:00 hours on the Pre-dispatch Day.

The System Operator shall issue provisional running orders based upon the Dispatch Schedule for the Dispatch Day to each Generating Unit by 16:00 hours on the Predispatch Day.

The provisional running orders issued to each Generating Unit by the System Operator, shall indicate the planned Load pattern specifying—

(a)	Forecast start-up and shut-down times, if relevant;

(b)	Forecast Active Power Dispatch levels for each Dispatch Period; and,

(c)	Forecast levels of Operating Reserve provision for each Dispatch Period, if the Generating Unit is contracted for Operating Reserve requirements.

Provisional running orders are indicative only, provided as a guide to the expected output requirements from Generating Units and are not Dispatch Instructions.

8.4.3.	Pre-dispatch Day unconstrained Schedule.—The System Operator shall produce a Pre-dispatch Day unconstrained Schedule for each Dispatch Day by 16:00 hours on the Pre-dispatch Day. The same principles specified in section 8.4.1 shall be applied with the following change—

(a) The known Transmission System constraints must be excluded.

This Schedule shall be used to forecast the Day-ahead Price consistent with the appropriate Market Rules.

8.4.4.	Dispatch Day Schedule.—If the System Operator forecasts a significant difference be-tween the provisional running orders and anticipated Dispatch Instructions, in the interval between the issue of provisional running orders and the issue of relevant Dispatch In-structions, the System Operator shall endeavour to notify this difference to impacted Generators. 

8.4.5.	System Congestion.—System Operator shall install and commission such real time equipment and software as to calculate Transmission System restrictions and Reliability margins per Dispatch Period.

System Operator shall change the Dispatch Schedule of the Generators in order to eliminate transmission congestion and to ensure the security and Reliability of system operation.

System Operator shall reduce the Transmission Services contributing to the congestion if it was not possible to eliminate congestion by changing the scheduling of the Generators.

System Operator shall further instruct all Users, independent of the transmission services, to take specific action in order to avoid more major disturbances in emergency situations.

8.4.6.	Ex-post Unconstrained Dispatch Schedule.—The System Operator shall produce an Expost Unconstrained Dispatch Schedule for each Dispatch Day by no later than 12:00 hours on the Calculation Day. This leaves the System Operator sufficient time to calculate the System Marginal Price for each Dispatch Period pursuant rule 11.2.1 of the Market Rules. The same principles specified in section 8.4.1 shall be applied with the following two changes—

(a) The actual Load readings must be used; and

(b) The Transmission System constraints must be excluded.

Generation Dispatch

8.5.1.	Dispatch Instructions To Generators.—The System Operator shall issue Dispatch Instruc-tions relating to the Dispatch Day at any time during the period beginning immediately after the issue of the Dispatch Schedule in respect of that Dispatch Day.

The System Operator shall give a Dispatch Instruction to a Generator for a specific Gen-erating Unit to change the output of Active Power, Reactive Power or an instruction to provide an Ancillary Service.

The System Operator shall give Dispatch Instructions to a Generator orally, by phone or by electronic means including by means of Automatic Generation Control. The Dispatch Instruction shall identify the relevant Generating Unit by specifying the Generator’s and Generating Unit’s unique identification number pursuant rule 4.5.1 of the Market Rules.

A Generator shall immediately and formally acknowledged a Dispatch Instruction in respect of a Generating Unit by telephone, or immediately provide a reason for non-acceptance. The reason for non-acceptance shall only be on safety grounds (relating to personnel or plant) or because the Dispatch Instruction is not in accordance with the Nomination or the Registered Information relevant to the time and period to which the Dispatch Instruction relates.

The System Operator shall be notified without delay by telephone in the event that in carrying out the Dispatch Instruction, an unforeseen problem arises, caused on safety grounds (relating to personnel or plant).

The System Operator shall maintain a record of all daily Dispatch Instructions issued to Generators.

8.5.2.	Generation Synchronising and Desynchronising Times.—The System Operator shall de-termine the required Synchronising and Desynchronising times for Generating Units.

The System Operator shall issue Dispatch Instructions to Generators to Synchronise (or Desynchronise) specific Generating Units in accordance with their Registered Information.

If a Dispatch Instruction to a Generator to Synchronise a specific Generating Unit does not also contain an Active Power Output to be achieved then it shall be assumed that the instruction is to increase output (following Synchronisation) up to the level of minimum generation of the Generating Unit as specified in the Registered Information.

The Generator shall immediately (at the time the discrepancy is identified) inform the System Operator of a situation and estimate the new Synchronising time, where Synchronising time issued by the System Operator to a Generator for a specific Generating Unit and the Generator identifies that the Generating Unit will not be Synchronised within + ten minutes of the instructed time.

The allowable tolerance appropriate to Synchronising times shall be based on the times set out in the Registered Information.

8.5.3.	Generation Active Power Dispatch.—Based on the Day-ahead Nominations of the Gen-erators, on System conditions, and on other factors as may arise from time to time. The System Operator shall issue Dispatch Instructions to a Generator in relation to a specific Generation Unit, which has been instructed to be Synchronised, to adjust its Active Power Output.

When a Generator has received and accepted a Dispatch Instruction for a Generating Unit to change the level of Active Power it shall without delay adjust the level of output of the Generating Unit to achieve the new target in line with its Registered Information and its Quantity Nomination.

A Generating Unit shall be deemed to have complied with a Dispatch Instruction when it achieves an output within the allowable tolerance as specified in rule 12.5.1 of the Market Rules. Deviations outside the allowable tolerance band will be treated according to rule 12.2.1 (c) of the Market Rules.

The adjustment of Active Power Output of a Generating Unit operating in a Frequency sensitive mode for System Frequency other than an average of 50Hz, shall be made in ac-cordance with the current registered value of Governor Droop for the Generating Unit.

The System Operator shall be notified immediately by telephone in the event that while carrying out the Dispatch Instruction an unforeseen problem arises caused by safety reasons (relating to personnel or plant).

8.5.4.	Generator Reactive Power Dispatch.—The System Operator shall issue Dispatch Instruc-tions to Generators to adjust the Reactive Power output of any Generating Unit that has been instructed to be Synchronised.

(a) A Generator shall be able to provide Reactive Power without having to produce or consume a large quantity of real power. The System Operator shall control the amount of reactive power. This may be done directly through the energy management system or by telephone.

(b)	When a Generator is generating, Reactive Power supply is mandatory in the full

operating range as specified in the Code.

(a)	Voltage control and the supply or consumption of Reactive Power are inter- related in the sense that the voltage is affected by changes in the Reactive Power flow. System stability depends on the voltage profile across the System. In view of these considera-tions it is necessary from time to time to employ certain power stations to supply or consume Reactive Power, whether or not they are producing Active Power, for the purpose of Voltage Control.

The Reactive Power output of any Generation Unit in respect of which a Dispatch Instruction is given shall then, without delay be adjusted in accordance with its Registered Information, to the new target Reactive Power so instructed, within, a tolerance of + 2% of the target or ± 2MVAr whichever is greater. The Reactive Power output of a Generating Unit shall not be adjusted (other than under AVR action) other than in response to a Dispatch Instruction from the System Operator.

Generators having achieved the new target Reactive Power output should not attempt to sustain this level of Reactive Power output as the System Voltage varies but should, rather, allow the Reactive Power output to vary under AVR control in accordance with registered Ancillary Service capabilities in the Registered Information.

While a Reactive Power Dispatch Instruction shall normally specify a new Reactive Power target for a Generating Unit, the System Operator shall also from time to time instruct Gen-erators to perform one or more tap changes on the Generator Transformer of a Generating Unit. The instruction for tap changes may be a simultaneous tap change instruction whereby the tap change shall be effected by the Generator in response to an instruction from the Sys-tem Operator issued simultaneously to relevant Power Stations. The instruction, which is normally preceded by advance warning, shall be effected within 1 minute of receipt from the System Operator of the instruction.

Dispatch Instructions in relation to Reactive Power shall include target Voltage levels to be achieved by the Generating Unit on the Transmission System at Connection Point (or on the Participant System at the Participant System Entry Point in the case of a Distribution Embedded Generator, namely on the higher voltage side of the Generator step-up transformer). Where a Generating Unit is instructed to a specified target voltage, the Generator shall achieve that target within a tolerance of 1 kV by tap changing on the Generator step-up transformer unless otherwise agreed with the System Operator. Under normal operating conditions, once this target Voltage level has been achieved, the Generator shall not tap change again without prior consultation with and agreement of the System Operator.

Under certain conditions such as low System Voltage, an instruction to maximum Reactive Power output at instructed Active Power Output shall be given and the Generator shall take appropriate action to maximise Reactive Power output unless constrained by plant operational limits or safety grounds relating to personnel or plant.

Under certain conditions such as high System Voltage, a Dispatch Instruction to maximum Reactive Power absorption at instructed Active Power Output shall be given and the Generator shall take appropriate action to maximise Reactive Power absorption unless constrained by plant operational limits or safety grounds relating to personnel or plant.

The issue of Dispatch Instructions for Active Power shall be made with due regard to any resulting change in Reactive Power capability and shall include reduction in Active Power Generation in order to increase Reactive Power capability.

The excitation system, unless otherwise agreed with the System Operator, shall be operated only in its constant terminal voltage mode of operation with Reactive Power limiters 

in service, with any constant Reactive Power output control mode or constant power factor output control mode always disabled, unless agreed otherwise with the System Operator. In the event of any change in System Voltage, a Generator shall not take any action to override automatic Reactive Power response which is produced as a result of constant terminal voltage mode of operation of the automatic excitation control system unless instructed otherwise by the System Operator or unless immediate action is necessary to comply with stability limits or unless constrained by plant operational limits or safety grounds (relating to personnel or plant).

A Dispatch Instruction relating to Reactive Power shall be implemented without delay and will be achieved not later than two minutes after the instruction time, or such longer period as the System Operator may instruct.

Where Dispatch Instructions relating to Active Power and Reactive Power are given together, and to achieve the Reactive Power output would cause the Generating Unit to operate outside Dispatch Scheduling and Dispatch parameters as a result of the Active Power instruction being met at the same time, then the timescale of implementation of the Reactive Power instruction shall be extended to be no longer than the timescale for implementing the Active Power instruction but in any case to achieve the Reactive Power Dispatch Instruction as soon as possible.

In circumstances where the System Operator issues new instructions in relation to more than one Generating Unit at the same Power Station at the same time tapping shall be carried out by the Generator one tap at a time either alternately between (or in sequential order, if more than two), or at the same time on, each Generating Unit, as the case may be.

Where the instructions require more than two taps per Generating Unit meaning that the instructions cannot be achieved within two minutes of the instruction time, (or such longer period at the System Operator may have instructed), the instructions shall each be achieved with the minimum of delay after the expiry of that period.

On receiving a new Active Power Dispatch Instruction, no tap changing shall be carried out to change the Reactive Power output unless there is a new Reactive Power Dispatch Instruction.

Where an instruction to Synchronise is given, or where a Generating Unit is Synchronised and a Active Power Dispatch Instruction is given, a Reactive Power Dispatch Instruction consistent with the Generating Unit’s relevant parameters shall be given. In the absence of a Reactive Power Dispatch Instruction with an instruction to Synchronise, the Reactive Power output should be 0 MVAr.

Where an instruction to Desynchronise is given, a Reactive Power Dispatch Instruction, compatible with shutdown, shall be given prior to Desynchronisation being achieved. In the absence of a separate Reactive Power Dispatch Instruction, it is implicit in the instruction to Desynchronise that Reactive Power output should at the point of Synchronism be 0 MVAr at Desynchronisation.

It should be noted that should System conditions require, the System Operator shall need to instruct maximum Reactive Power output to be achieved as soon as possible, but in any event no later than two minutes after the instruction is issued.

On receipt of a Dispatch Instruction relating to Reactive Power, the Generator shall take such action as is necessary to maintain the integrity of the Generating Unit (including, without limitation, requesting a revised Dispatch Instruction), and shall contact the System Operator without delay.

Reactive Power Dispatch Instructions issued by the System Operator shall reflect the limits contained in the Registered Information regarding Ancillary Service capabilities and Quantity Nominations.

Under System fault conditions it is possible for AVR action to drive Reactive Power output for a Generating Unit outside of its limits as contained in its Registered Information. The Generator shall immediately inform the System Operator of the situation. However if the Generator reasonably believes that the situation may be dangerous to personnel or plant, then limited action shall be taken to improve the situation.

8.5.5.	System Alerts.—The System Operator shall notify Generators, by one of several means, of the existence of a System Emergency Condition.

8.5.6.	System Emergency Conditions.—The System Operator may instruct Generators to operate outside the limits implied by the then current Registered Information in order to maintain Transmission System integrity under System Emergency Conditions.

Where the System Operator has issued an emergency instruction requiring operation of a Generation Unit outside the limits applied by the then applicable Quantity Nomination and Registered Information, then the Generator shall comply with the emergency instruction if, in the reasonable opinion of the Generator, the safety of personnel, and/or plant is not compromised in complying with the request.

8.5.7.	Failure to Comply With a Dispatch Instruction.—The Generator shall inform the System Operator by telephone without delay if at any time a Generating Unit is unable to comply with any Dispatch Instruction correctly issued by the System Operator in respect of any Generating Unit.

8.5.8.	Constrained Generation.—Constrained generation is the service supplied by a Power sta-tion to the System Operator by constraining its power output below (alternatively above) the unconstrained schedule level. The service is required to ensure that the Transmission Network remains between appropriate operational limits (e.g. thermal, voltage or stability limits).

In providing the service, the Power station experiences a financial loss, for which it shall be compensated by the Transmission Network according to the market rules. Constrained generation is required to meet network Reliability as there are no current rules for market splitting across transmission constraints or the handling of units in strategic positions.

The identification of the specific Transmission Network constraints applicable at any point in time shall be the responsibility of the System Operator.

9.	Outage Co-ordination

Objective

9.1.1.	The objective of this section is to define the requirements for formal notification of Outages by Generators to the System Operator.

General

9.2.1.	Secure operation of an electricity system requires that the maintenance of the Generating Units should be co-ordinated with the Outages of critical Transmission lines. This is essen-tial in order to enable the System Operator to fulfil its obligations relating to the operation of the Transmission System, and to enable Generators to plan their Outages in an orderly way. The mechanisms by which this is achieved will be formalised in this section.

Outage scheduling

9.3.1.	The System Operator, Distributors and Generators shall establish schedules for inspection and preventive maintenance of its Generation, Transmission, protection, control, commu-nication and other auxiliary systems. These maintenance and inspection schedules shall be co-ordinated to ensure an equipment Outage pattern that shall not violate Power System Reliability.

9.3.2.	Planning and Co-ordination.—The System Operator shall co-ordinate all Outage plans for the Distributors and Generators on an annual basis. These plans shall be ready by October of every year. The System Operator shall then be responsible to perform pertinent Reliability studies to ensure the secure operation of the Power System during the Outages as has been agreed in the annual Outage plans.

Scheduled Generation and Transmission Outages that may affect the Reliability of Power System operations shall be planned and co-ordinated (notification of cancellation at least twenty-four hours in advance) amongst affected parties. Special attention shall be given to results of pertinent studies. The Planned Outage shall be advised at least two weeks in advance and confirmed in writing. The System Operator shall advise all the Distributors and Generators of the return of any of the equipment.

9.3.3.	Voltage Regulating Equipment.—System Operator shall co-ordinate all scheduled Outages of System voltage regulating equipment, such as automatic voltage regulators on Generators, supplementary excitation control, synchronous condensers, shunt and series capacitors, reactors, etc.

9.3.4.	Metering and Control Equipment.—The System Operator shall co-ordinate scheduled Outages of metering and control equipment and associated communication channels.

9.3.5.	Generator requirements.—

(a)	Generators shall specify with regard to each of their Generating Units, the start date, time and duration of each Outage. In pursuant of section 10.3.1, statutory Outage plans for Generating Units for subsequent years after the current year must reach System Operator by 1 August of the current year.

(b)	Each Generator shall act in accordance with Good Utility Practice in planning their Outages. In particular, so as to avoid a situation arising in which a Generator is obliged to schedule an Outage at short notice by reason of obligations imposed upon the Generator by statute as a consequence of the Generator not having planned in accordance with Good Utility Practice.

(c)	Generators shall specify the following, unless they reasonably substantiate that an Outage is inflexible—

(i)	an alternative preferred windows of opportunity within the year for any Outage;

(ii)	the minimum Outage duration which would be acceptable, if less than the scheduled Outage duration;

(iii)	situations where the paralleling of Outages of two or more of its Generating Units may be required, desirable, undesirable or not possible;

(iv)	a priority order associated with the various Outages scheduled by the Gen-erator; and

(v)	any Outages where it is particularly desirable that they should take place within the year scheduled.

(d)	Any Outage where its timing is dependent on Generating Unit run hours, equiva

lent run hours or starts.

9.3.6.	Distribution Company Requirements.—Each Distribution Company shall act in accordance with Good Utility Practice in planning their network line Outages. Information shall be furnished by 1 August of each year—

(a)	Load in MW not to be available from any connection point;

(b)	Identification of equipment/apparatus at connection point where there will be outage;

(c)	Period of which network line will be unavailable with Start-date and Start-time and End-date and End-time.

9.3.7.	Outage Scheduling Program.—The System Operator shall present the co-ordinated Outage plans as well as the results of the Reliability studies in report format to the Commission for approval.

9.4.1.	System Operator change request.—The System Operator can, providing the relevant rea-sons, request a Generator to change the timing or duration of any Outage of one of the Generator’s Generating Units in the Outage scheduling programme.

Changes to the Committed Outage Scheduling Programme

9.4.2.	Generator Response.—A Generator may respond either by declining the request, or by agreeing to the request. Generators shall make every reasonable effort to co-operate with reasonable changes requested by the System Operator.

9.4.3.	Agreement to Conditions.—If a Generator responds by agreeing to the request subject to specific conditions, the System Operator may respond by either confirming agreement to those conditions or by declining agreement. Where the System Operator agrees to the conditions, then the Outage scheduling programme shall be amended accordingly. Where the System Operator declines to agree to the conditions, then the System Operator may negotiate with the Generator as to revised or alternative conditions, which would be acceptable.

9.4.4.	Generator Change Request.—A Generator may at any time request the System Operator for a change in the timing or duration of any Outage of one of the Generator’s Generating Units in the Outage scheduling programme. The System Operator may accept or decline the request. The Outage scheduling programme shall be amended accordingly or the System Operator shall negotiate with the Generator conditions, which shall be acceptable to both parties.

9.4.5.	 Deviations from Outage Scheduling Programme.—The System Operator shall compile an annual report to indicate how the Outage scheduling program of the previous year was adhered to. Specific reasons shall be provided for each deviation to the original approved Outage scheduling programme.

The Commission shall review this report in order to ensure the improvement of the System Operator’s performance over a number of years. 

Other Information to be notified

9.5.1.	Ancillary Services.—Generators shall inform the System Operator of any proposed main-tenance, in addition to Outages, which shall, or is likely to, affect the capability of the Generating Unit to provide Ancillary Services.

9.5.2.	Security of Supply.—The System Operator shall request alterations to maintenance, where security of supply or the secure operation of the Transmission System would be at risk. The System Operator shall make reasonable endeavours to give as much notice as possible for such requests for alterations. Where the System Operator makes such a request, the Generator shall use reasonable endeavours to comply with the request in arriving at the Generator’s final programme for such maintenance.

10.	Reliability measures

Objective

10.1.1.	The objective of this section is to define the Reliability criteria and measures the System Operator and the TSP have adhere to in operating, maintaining and developing of the Transmission System.

General

10.2.1.	In order to maintain reliable operation of the Transmission System, it is necessary that all systems observe and subscribe to certain minimum planning criteria.

10.2.2.	The criteria and principles provided in this document serve as a guideline to develop criteria and methodologies applicable to the TSP, System Operator, Users and related In-terconnections.

10.2.3.	Reliability measures.—Traditionally the measurement of transmission Reliability is achieved through the deterministic N-l Criteria. This criterion should be regarded as a minimum standard. Additional to this the System Operator should develop probabilistic criteria. The fundamental attributes for Reliability measures to be considered to evaluate risk of probable extreme events include—

(a)	The Frequency of events (e.g. frequency of circuit overload— 0.72 events/year);

(b)	Duration of events (e.g. duration of circuit overload— 2.5 hours/year); and

(c)	Severity of events (how does event impact on load curtailment);

From these attributes other indices to quantify network performance can be calcu-lated. To enable the definition of applicable indices, which may apply to the TSP and System Operator, a number of concepts and definitions related to network, configuration and aspects influencing network performance are discussed in Ap-pendix 3.

Applicable Reliability Criteria

10.3.1.	The System Operator shall study and assess the overall Reliability (adequacy and security) of the Power System, both existing and as planned, to ensure that the Power System development conforms to the Transmission Planning Criteria.

10.3.2.	The System Operator shall develop Applicable Reliability Criteria for the Nigerian Transmission System for approval by the Commission.

Reliability Indicators

10.4.1.	The Applicable Reliability Criteria as stated in Appendix 3.1.2 shall specify specific measurable Reliability indicators. These can be expanded based on the System Operator, TSP and Users’ needs. All of these indicators can be calculated for a defined recording period. The length of the period should be measured in years to facilitate comparison.

Reporting

10.5.1.	The System Operator shall prepare and publish an annual assessment report of the Reli-ability of the Transmission System for review by the Commission.

10.5.2.	To carry out these tasks, sufficient data and input must be made available to evaluate and analyse the Applicable Reliability Criteria.

11.	Operational Testing on the Network

Objective

11.1.1.	The objective of this section is to establish approach to central co-ordination and control of an operational test required by the System Operator, the TSP or a User, where such test shall or may—

(a)	Affect the secure operation of the Transmission System;

(b)	Have a significant effect on the operation of the Transmission System or a Partici-pant’s System;

(c)	Affect the economic operation of the Transmission System or a Participant’s Sys-tem; and

(d)	Affect the quality or continuity of electricity supply to Users.

General

11.2.1.	This section deals with the responsibilities and procedures for arranging and carrying out operational tests that may have an effect on the systems of the TSP and Users.

11.2.2.	By their nature, operational tests may have an impact on either or both of—

(a)	The System Operator’s responsibilities in respect of the Transmission System, including Dispatch of Generation; and

(b)	The operations of Users and the quality and continuity of supply of electricity to Users.

11.2.3.	To minimise disruption to the operation of the Transmission System and to the Systems of other Users, it is necessary that tests that affect the operation of the Transmission System or Users’ Systems be subject to central co-ordination and control.

11.2.4.	These tests are not intended to deal with tests that may be called routinely by TSP in order to assess compliance of Users with their design, operating and connection requirements.

Tests Required by TSP or System Operator

11.3.1.System Operator's Responsibility.—System Operator as operator of the Transmission System shall carry out operational tests in accordance with Good Utility Practice, in order to maintain and develop operational procedures, to train staff, and to acquire information in respect of Power System behaviour under abnormal system conditions. The System

Operator shall endeavour to limit the Frequency of occurrence, scope, extent of effects and type of operational tests to those required by Good Utility Practice.

113.2.Range of Tests.—Operational tests required by the System Operator or the TSP from time to time shall include, but shall not be limited to the following—

(a)	Tests involving the controlled application of Frequency and/or Voltage variations aimed at gathering information on Power System behaviour;

(b)	Power System restoration tests (i.e. Black Start test at power station);

(c)	Testing of standing procedures for System Emergency Conditions; and

(d)	Testing or monitoring of power quality under various Power System conditions and Dispatch configurations.

11.3.3. .Notice to Users.—Where the System Operator or TSP intends to carry out an operational test, and such test will or may have an operational effect on a Participant’s system, the System Operator shall provide notice to the relevant Participant of the scheduled time and effect of the operational test as is reasonable in all the circumstances and shall keep the relevant Participant informed as to any changes to the scheduled time and nature of the operational test.

11.3.4	Request for Additional Time.—A Participant, having been informed about an operational test may contact the System Operator to request additional time to consider the impact of the test on the Participant. The System Operator shall co-operate with the Participant to assess the risks. The test shall not proceed until all Users are satisfied unless, in the Sys-tem Operator’s view, a Participant is acting unreasonably.

Tests required by User(s).

11.4.1.	Users’  Responsibility.—Operation of Users’ plant in accordance with Good Utility Practice requires operational testing in order to maintain and develop operational procedures, develop and measure plant performance, comply with statutory or other industry obliga-tions and to train staff.

In accordance with Good Utility Practice each Participant shall endeavour to limit the Frequency of occurrence of operational tests and to limit the effects of such operational tests on the Transmission System.

11.4.2. Procedure for Requesting Operational Tests.—Users shall submit a request for an opera-tional test in time. As part of the request, the Users, when requesting an operational test, shall supply sufficient detail to the System Operator to allow any operational consequences of the test to be adequately assessed. This shall include the following information—

(a)	The reason for the proposed test;

(b)	The preferred time or times for the test;

(c)	The milestones for individual stages of the operational test;

(d)	Whether there may be an adverse material impact on the Participant if the opera-tional test is cancelled at short notice or delayed; and 

(e)	Where the Participant is a Generator, the Dispatch or Dispatches required by the Generator for completion of the test.

Additionally, the factors that influence the completion of the stages should be out-lined to the System Operator, e.g., if the procedure to be followed for a certain stage depends on the outcome of a previous stage.

11.4.3.	Generator Specific Request.—A request by a Generator for an operational test requiring a Generating Unit to be Dispatched to a particular Active Power output or operating condi-tion shall not be considered a re-declaration of Availability, Ancillary Service capability or operating characteristics.

Evaluation of Proposed Operational Tests

11.5.1	Impact Assessment.—The System Operator shall, on receipt of an operational test request from a Participant, assess the impact of the proposed test on the operation of the Power System. The System Operator may request additional information from the Participant required evaluating the impact of the test.

11.5.2 .Objections and Sensitivity.—The System Operator shall evaluate the impact of the opera-tional test with users that might be significantly affected. Any reasonable objections from any such Users shall be considered. When discussing the operational test with any af-fected Participant, the System Operator shall not disclose what it reasonably believes to be commercially sensitive or otherwise potentially sensitive information to Users without the consent of the Participant requesting the test.

11.5.3.	Generator Dispatch Outside Currently Registered Values.—Where an operational test requested by a Generator in respect of one of its Generating Units requires a Dispatch that is outside the currently registered values of Availability, Ancillary Service capability or operating characteristics of the Generating Unit, then the System Operator may so Dispatch the Generating Unit for the period required for the operational test.

Approval for Operational Testing

(a)	The	impact	of the operational test	on Transmission System operation	security;

(b)	The	impact	of the operational test	on Transmission System operation	economics;

(c)	The	impact	of the operational test	on other Users’ systems; and

(d)	The	effect of the operational test on continuity and quality of electricity supply.

11.6.2.	Proposed Dispatch Procedure.—On approval by the System Operator of an operational test requested by a Participant, who is a Generator, the System Operator shall contact the Generator outlining the proposed Dispatch procedure and schedule.

On receipt of the proposed Dispatch procedure and schedule of the operational test, the test requestor shall notify the System Operator without undue delay, of the test re-questor’s acceptance or rejection of the proposed Dispatch procedure and schedule for the operational test.

11.6.3.	Rejection of Dispatch procedure.—On notification of rejection of the proposed Dispatch procedure and schedule for the operational test by the test requestor, the operational test shall not take place. The test requestor may enter into discussions with the System Operator as to an alternative schedule for the operational test, or may request a different operational test, or may request the operational test at an alternative time.

11.6.4.	Acceptance of Dispatch procedure.—On notification of acceptance of the proposed Dis-patch procedure and schedule for the operational test by the test requestor, the System Operator shall inform other Users as to the scheduled time and nature of the test, if in the opinion of the System Operator those Users shall or may be significantly affected by the test, or otherwise as dictated by standing arrangements.

11.6.5.	Concerns by affected Users.—If users that might be significantly affected are not satisfied with the proposed operational test, they shall advise the System Operator of their concerns. The System Operator shall not cancel the proposed operational test unless these objections are reasonable. If operationally affected Users are still not satisfied with the operational test being approved, and then they may appeal the decision to the Commission.

Scheduling of Operational Tests

11.7.1.	Where the System Operator requires an operational test, either—

(a)	The Generator/User shall nominate half-hourly Active Power outputs and con-straints and the System Operator shall then Dispatch consistent with the planned operational test, or

(b)	Where operational test costs and conditions have been agreed in advance between the Generator/User and the System Operator, the Generator shall nominate in ac-cordance with the System Operator requirements for the operational test.

11.7.2.	Test prioritisation.—The System Operator shall use reasonable endeavours to prioritise operational tests where the test requestor has notified the System Operator that operational tests are required in accordance with licence conditions, statutory regulations or safety Codes or a delay in the execution of the tests may have an adverse material impact on a Participant.

Dispatching of Operational Tests

11.8.1.	Dispatch Instructions.—The System Operator shall issue Dispatch Instructions for opera-tional tests in the normal manner for issuing Dispatch Instructions.

The System Operator shall use reasonable endeavours to ensure that scheduled operational tests are Dispatched in accordance with the agreed upon Dispatch procedures.

11.8.2	Revised test procedure.—Where the System Operator assesses that the impact of an op-erational test on Transmission System security or on the continuity and Quality of Supply or operation of a Participant may or is likely to be significantly greater than originally estimated, the System Operator may contact the test requestor to discuss a revised test procedure or schedule.

11.8.3.Possibility of cancellation or postponement.—Where the System Operator foresees a requirement or likely requirement to cancel, postpone or otherwise significantly alter an agreed upon Dispatch procedure and schedule, then the System Operator shall inform the test requestor as soon as reasonably possible.

11.8.4.	Cancellation, interruption or postponement of test.—The System Operator may where it considers it necessary, cancel, interrupt or postpone an operational test at any time, but shall, where possible, utilise the agreed upon procedures prior to taking such action where the cancellation, interruption or postponement is for other than technical reasons.

11.8.5.	Cancellation by test requestor.—If the test requestor wishes to cancel an operational test either before commencement of the test or during the test, the test requestor shall notify the System Operator. Nominations and Dispatch Instructions shall remain valid when op-erational tests are cancelled.

Test Reporting

11.9.1.	Scheduled Completion Time.—Upon conclusion of the scheduled time for an operational test the test requestor shall notify the System Operator as to whether the test, or sections of the test, if divided into sections, has been completed.

11:9.2.Reporting.—At the conclusion of the operational test, the test requestor shall be responsi-ble for preparing a written report on the operational test which shall be available to the System Operator, operationally effected Users and the Commission on request within thirty days of the conclusion of the operational test.

The Report shall include a description of the plant and/or apparatus tested and a description of the system test carried out together with the results, conclusions and recommendations as they relate to the System Operator and operationally affected Users.

11.9.3.Report confidentiality.—The Report shall not be submitted to any person who is not a representative of the System Operator or the test requestor unless the System Operator and the test requestor, having reasonably considered the confidentiality issues arising shall have unanimously approved such submission.

12.	Safety and Co-ordination

Objective

12.1.1.	The objective of this section is to achieve Safety from the network when work on an Equipment necessitates the provision of Safety Precautions on another equipment on the Equipment up to a Connection Point.

12.1.2.	A flow chart in Appendix 4 illustrates the process utilised in this code to achieve the ob-jective set out. In the case of a conflict between the flow chart and the provisions of an agreed procedure, the agreed procedure will prevail.

General

12.2.1.	This section specifies the standard operating procedures to be used by System Operator, TSP and Users of the network for the co-ordination, establishment and maintenance of necessary Safety Precautions when work is to be carried out on the Transmission Network or a User’s apparatus and when there is a need for Safety Precautions on the High Voltage equipment on the other’s system for work to be carried out safely. The term 'work' includes testing, other than Network Tests. This section applies between System Operator, TSP and Users and does not impose a particular set of Safety Rules on TSP and Users; the Safety Rules to be adopted and used by TSP and Users shall be those chosen by them. This Safety procedure applies to—

(a)	TSP

(b)	System Operator

(c)	Generators

(d)	Distribution Network Operators

(e)	Customers Connected to the Transmission System

Interpretation

12.3.1.In this procedure, the following terms shall have the meaning—

(a)	'High Voltage equipment' means High Voltage electrical circuits forming part of a System, on which Safety from the System may be required or on which Safety Precautions may be applied to allow work to be carried out on a circuit.

(b)	'Isolation' means the disconnection of Equipment from the remainder of the network in which the equipment is situated by either of the following—

(i)	an Isolating Device maintained in an isolating position. The isolating position must either be—

(6.i.l) maintained by immobilising the Locking and Isolating Device in the isolating position and affixing a Caution Notice to it. Where the Iso-lating Device is Locked with a Safety Key, the Safety Key must be secured in a Key Safe. Key Safe must be retained in a safe custody; or

(b.i.2) maintained and/or secured by such other method which must be in accordance with the Local Safety Instructions of TSP or that of the User, as the case may be; or

(ii)	An adequate physical separation which must be in accordance with, and maintained by, the method set out in the Local Safety Instructions of TSP or that of the User as the case may be, and, if it is a part of that method, a Cautious Notice must be placed at the point of separation.

(c)	'Earthing' means a way of providing a connection between conductors and the earth by an Earthing Device which is either—

(i)	immobilised and Locked in an earthing position. Where the Earthing Device is locked with a Safety Key, the Safety Key must be secured in a Key Safe. Key Safe must be retained in a safe custody; or

(ii)	maintained and/or secured by such other method which must be in accor-dance with the Local Safety Instructions of the TSP or that of the User, as the case may be.

Procedure

12.4.1 .Approval of Local Safety Instructions

(a)	In accordance with the timing requirements of its Agreement with the TSP, each User will supply to the TSP a copy of its Local Safety Instructions relating to its side of the Connection Point at each Connection Site.

(b)	In accordance with the timing requirements of each User Agreement, the TSP will supply to each User a copy of its Local Safety Instructions relating to the TSP side of the Connection Point at each Connection Site. 

(c)	Prior to connection each party must have approved the other’s relevant Local

Safety Instructions in relation to Isolation and Earthing.

(d)	Either party may require that the Isolation and/or Earthing provisions in the other

party’s Local Safety Instructions affecting the Connection Site should be made more stringent in order that approval of the other party’s Local Safety Instructions can be given. Provided these requirements are not unreasonable, the other party will make such changes as soon as reasonably practicable.

If approved, a party that wishes to change the provisions in its Local Safety Instructions relating to Isolation and/or Earthing after approval, must inform the other party. If the change is to make the provisions more stringent, then the other party merely has to note the changes. If the change is to relax the provisions, then the other party need to assess and approve the new provisions and procedures referred to in 13.4.1 (c).

Safety Co-ordinators—For each Connection Point, the TSP and each User must at all times have person(s) (Safety Co-ordinator(s)) to be responsible for the co-ordination of Safety Precautions when work is to be carried out on the network or parts of it which necessitates the provision of Safety Precautions on High Voltage Equipment pursuant of this section of the Grid Code. A Safety Co-ordinator may be responsible for the coordination of safety at more than one Connection Point of the network.

Each Safety Co-ordinator shall be authorised by the TSP or a User, as the case may be, as competent to carry out the functions set out to achieve Safety from the Network at all times.

Only authorised person at the TSP and the User(s) will carry out Safety activities at all times.

Contact between Safety Co-ordinators at TSP and User(s) will be made via normal opera-tional channels, and accordingly separate telephone numbers for Safety Co-ordinators need be registered and available at TSP and Users at all times.

If work is to be carried out on the network which necessitates the provision of Safety Pre-cautions, in accordance with the provisions of this section, the requesting Safety Co-ordinator who requires Safety Precautions to be provided shall contact the relevant implementing Safety Co-ordinator to co-ordinate the establishment of Safety Precautions throughout the work.

Record of Network Safety Precautions (RNSP)

12.5.1.	The TSP and Users will use the format of the RNSP forms set out in Appendix 4A and 4B of this Code. That set out in Appendix 4A and designated as 'RNSP-R”, shall be used when the TSP is requesting Safety Co-ordinator, and that in Appendix 4B designated as 'RNSP-I' when the TSP is implementing Safety Co-ordinator. Proformas of RNSP-R and RNSP-I must be provided by the TSP and Users for use at all times when Safety Precaution is required.

12.5.2.	All references to RNSP-R and RNSP-I shall be taken as referring to the corresponding parts of the alternative forms or other tangible written records agreed between the TSP and the User.

12.5.3.	RNSP-R will have an identifying number written or printed on it, comprising a prefix which identifies the location at which it is issued, and a unique serial number consisting of four digits and suffix 'R' for the TSP and the User.

12.5.4.	Each User shall apply to the TSP for approval of its proposed prefix.

12.5.5.	The TSP shall consider the proposed prefix to see if it is the same as a prefix used by the TSP or another User or not confusing. The TSP shall respond in writing within ten days of its decision on the prefix to the User.

12.5.6.If the TSP disapproves, it shall explain in its response why it has disapproved and will suggest an alternative prefix. In this situation, the User shall either notify the TSP in writing of its acceptance of the suggested alternative prefix or it shall apply in writing to the TSP with its revised prefix proposal and the above procedure shall apply.

Safety Precautions on High Voltage Equipment

12.6.1. Safety Precautions.—For the purpose of co-ordination of safety relating to High Voltage equipment, the term 'Safety Precautions' means Isolation and /or Earthing.

12.6.2.	Agreement of Safety Precautions.—The Safety Co-ordinator requesting Safety Precautions on another Equipment or parts of the Transmission Network will contact the relevant implementing Safety Co-ordinator(s) to agree the location of the Safety Precautions to be established. This agreement will be recorded in the respective Safety Logs.

It is the responsibility of the implementing Safety Co-ordinator to ensure that adequate Safety Precautions are established and maintained, on his and/or another Equipment connected to his equipment, to enable Safety from the Equipment to be achieved on the High voltage Equipment, specified by the requesting Safety Co-ordinator which is to be identified in RNSP.

When the implementing Safety Co-ordinator is of the reasonable opinion that it is necessary for Safety Precautions on the System of the requesting Safety Co-ordinator, other than on the High Voltage Equipment specified by the requesting Safety Co-ordinator, which is to be identified in RNSP, he shall contact the requesting Safety Co-ordinator and the details shall be recorded in the RNSP forms. It is the responsibility of the requesting Safety Co-ordinator to establish and maintain such Safety Precautions.

In the event where the requesting Safety Co-ordinator and the implementing Safety Co-ordinator are unable to agree the location of the isolation and (if requested) Earthing, both shall be at the closest available points on the infeeds to the High Voltage equipment on which Safety from the network is to be achieved as indicated on the operating diagram.

12.6.3.	Implementation of Isolation.—Following the agreement of the Safety Precautions in ac-cordance with 13.6.2 the implementing Safety Co-ordinator shall then establish the agreed Isolation.

The implementing Safety Co-ordinator shall conform to the requesting Safety Coordinator that the agreed Isolation has been established, and identify the requesting Safety Co-ordinator’s High Voltage Equipment up to the Connection Point, for which the Isolation has been provided. The confirmation shall specify—

(a)	For each location, the identity (by means of High Voltage Equipment, name, no-menclature and numbering or position as applicable) of each point of Isolation, whether Isolation has been achieved by an isolating Device in the isolating position or by an adequate physical separation;

(b)	Where an Isolated Device has been used whether the isolating position is either—

(i) Maintained by immobilising and Locking the Isolating Device in the isolating position and affixing a Caution Notice to it. Where the Isolating Device has been Locked with a Safety Key that the Safety Key has been secured in a Key Safe and the Key Safe will be retained in a safe custody;

(c)	Where an adequate physical separation has been used that will be in accordance with, and maintained by the method set out in the Local Safety Instructions of TCN or that of the User, as the case may be, and, if it is part of that method, that a Caution Notice be placed at the point of separation.

(d)	The conformation of Isolation shall be recorded in the respective Safety Logs.

12.6.4.	Implementation of Earthing.—The Safety Co-ordinator shall confirm to the Requesting Safety Co-ordinator that the agreed Earthing has been established, and identify the Re-questing Safety Co-ordinator’s HV equipment for which earthing has been provided. The conformation shall specify—

(a)	For each location, the identity (by means of HV Equipment name, nomenclature and numbering or position, as is applicable) of each point of Earthing; and

(b)	In respect of the Earthing Device used, whether it is—

(i)	Immobilised and Locked in the earthing position. Where the Earthing Device has been Locked with a Safety Key, that the Safety Key has been secured in a Key Safe and the Key Safe will be retained in safe custody; or

(ii)	Maintained and/or secured in position by such other method which is in accordance with the Local Safety Instruction of the TSP or that User, as the case may be.

The confirmation of Earthing shall be recorded in the respective Safety Logs.

The Implementing Safety Co-ordinator shall ensure that the established Safety Precautions are maintained until requested to be removed by the relevant Requesting safety Co-ordinator.

12.6.5.	Procedure for Issuing RNSP.—Where Safety Precautions on another Equipment are being provided to enable work on the Requesting Safety Co-ordinator’s Equipment, before any work commences they must be recorded by the RNSP being issued. The RNSP is applicable to High Voltage Equipment up to the Connection Point identified in the RNSP-R andRNSP-1 forms.

Where Safety Precautions are being provided to enable work to be carried out on both sides of the Connection Point an RNSP will need to be issued for each side of the Connection Point with the TSP and the respective User each enacting the role of requesting Safety Co-ordinator. This will result in an RNSP-R and RNSP-I form being completed by each of the TSP and the User, with each Safety Co-ordinator issuing on RNSP number.

Once the Safety Precautions have been established, the Implementing Safety Co-ordinator shall complete form RNSP-I recording the details specified in 12.6.2,12.6.3 and 13.6.4.

The Requesting Safety Co-ordinator shall complete form RNSP-R, making a precise copy of the details received. On completion, the Requesting Safety Co-ordinator shall read the entries made back to the sender and check that an accurate copy has been made.

The Requesting Safety Co-ordinator shall then issue the number of the RNSP taken from the RNSP-R, to the Implementing Safety Co-ordinator who will ensure that the number, including the prefix and suffix, is accurately recorded in the designated space on the RNSP-I form.

The Requesting Safety Co-ordinator and the Implementing Safety Co-ordinator shall complete and sign appropriate parts of the RNSP-R and RNSP-I forms respectively and then enter the time and date. When signed no alteration to the RNSP is permitted; the RNSP may only be cancelled.

The Requesting Safety Co-ordinator is then free to authorise work (including a test that does not affect the Implementing Safety Co-ordinator’s equipment) Where testing is to be carried out which affects the Implementing Safety Co-ordinator’s equipment, the procedure set out in 13.6.7 shall be implemented.

12.6.6.	RNSP Cancellation Procedure.—When the Requesting Safety Co-ordinator decides that Safety Precautions are no longer required, he will contact the relevant Implementing Safety Co-ordinator to effect cancellation of the associated RNSP.

The Requesting Safety Co-ordinator will inform the relevant Implementing Safety Coordinator of the RNSP identifying number (including the prefix and suffix), and agree it is the RNSP to be cancelled.

The Requesting Safety Co-ordinator and the relevant Implementing Safety Co-ordinator shall then respectively complete form RNSP-R and RNSP-I forms with their names and contact address and shall then exchange details. On exchange of details the respective RNSP is cancelled.

Neither Safety Co-ordinator shall instruct the removal of any Isolation forming part of the Safety Precautions as part of the returning of the High Voltage equipment to service until it is committed to each by each other that every earth on each side of the Connection Point, within the points of isolation identified on the RNSP, has been removed or disconnected by the provision of additional Points of Isolation.

Subject to provisions in this Condition the Implementing Safety Co-ordinator is then free to arrange the removal of the safety Precautions, the procedure to achieve that being entirely an internal matter for the party the Implementing Safety Co-ordinator is representing. Nothing in this Code prevents the TSP and Users agreeing to a simultaneous cancellation and issue a new RNSP, if both agree.

12.6.7.	Testing Affecting Another Safety Co-ordinator's Equipment.—The carrying out of test may affect Safety Precautions on RNSPs or work being carried out which does not require a RNSP. Testing can, for example include the application of an independent test voltage. Accordingly, where the Requesting Safety Co-ordinator wishes to authorise the carrying out of such a test to which the procedures in this section of the Grid Code apply he may not do so and the test will not take place unless the steps in (a) to (c) below have been followed and conformation of completion has been recorded in the respective Safety Logs—

(a)	Confirmation must be obtained from the Implementing Safety Co-ordinator that—

(i)	no person is working on, or testing, or has been authorised to work on, or test, any part of its equipment or another equipment (other than the equipment of the Requesting Safety Co-ordinator) within the points of Isolation identified on the RNSP form relating to the test which is proposed to be undertaken; and   

(b)	Any other current RNSP which relate to the parts of the equipment in which the testing is to take place must have been cancelled in accordance with procedures set out in 13.6.6.

(c)	The Implementing Safety Co-ordinator must agree with the Requesting Safety Co-ordinator to permit the testing on that part of the equipment between the points of Isolation identified in the RNSP associated with the test and the points of Isolation on the Requesting Safety Co-ordinator’s equipment.

(d)	The Requesting Safety Co-ordinator will inform the Implementing Safety Coordinator as soon as the test has been completed or cancelled and the confirmation shall be recorded in the respective Safety Logs.

(e)	When the test gives rise to the removal of Earthing which it is not intended to re-apply, the relevant RNSP associated with the test shall be cancelled at the completion or can-cellation of the test in accordance with the procedure set out in either 13.6.5 or 13.6.6. Where the Earthing is re-applied following the completion or cancellation of the test, there is no requirement to cancel the relevant RNSP associated with the test pursuant to this Condition.

12.6.8.	Emergency Situations.—There may be circumstances where Safety Precautions need to be established in relation to an unintended electrical connection or situations where there is an unintended risk of electrical connection between the Transmission Network and a User’s Equipment, for example resulting from an incident where one line becomes attached or unacceptably close to another.

In those circumstances, if both the TSP and the respective User agree, the relevant provisions of 12.6.5 will apply as if the electrical connections or potential connections were, solely for the purposes of this section, a Connection Point.

The relevant Safety Co-ordinator shall be that for the electrically closest existing Connection Point to that User’s equipment or such other local Connection Point as may be agreed between the TSP and the User, with discussions taking place between the relevant local Safety Co-ordinators. The Connection Point to be used shall be known in this Condition as the 'relevant Connection Point”.

(a)	The Local Safety Instructions shall be those which apply to the relevant Connection Point.

(b)	The prefix for the RISSP will be that which applies for the relevant Connection Point.

12.6.9.	Loss of Integrity of Safety Precautions.—In any instance when any Safety Precautions may be ineffective for any reason the relevant Safety Co-ordinator shall inform the other Safety Co-ordinator(s) without delay of that being the case and, if requested, of the reasons why.

12.6.10.Safety Log.—The TSP and Users shall maintain Safety Logs which shall be a chronological record of all messages relating to Safety Co-ordination under this code sent and received by the Safety Co-ordinator(s). The Safety Logs must be retained for a period of not less than one year.

22.3.3.	The new contracts for the procurement of additional generation capacity by the Special Trader in the Transitional Stage shall be designed in like manner to Special Contracts, but shall include the following additional characteristics—

(a)	The Special Trader, the Generator and the corresponding Distributor will sign a Special Contract. The role of the Special Trader in the contract will be as a facilitator and load aggregator.

(b)	The contract design shall assign construction risks as well as risk of cost overruns to the generation investor.

(c)	Effective dates and prices or price formula shall be defined clearly at the time that the new contract is signed.

(d)	If any capacity charges are included in the contract, it shall be based on

an availability target that shall not be lower than a standard availability defined by the Commission.

(e)	In order to simulate future bilateral contracts, the quantity assignment in the contracts shall be proportional to energy consumption of each Dis-tributor.

(f)	 Payments shall be between made each Distributor and Generator, as would be the case under a bilateral contract.

(g)	The Special Trader may provide any contract guarantees that are re-quired until such time as the relevant Distributor is able to provide the requisite guarantee for its contract or in any case, until privatisation of such distributor. Once the Distributor provides its own guarantee, the corresponding guarantee obligation of the Special Trader will automati-cally lapse.

(h)	Each contract will include the provisions for novation thereof, to enable its transformation into a bilateral contract between the Generator and the Distributor at the commencement of the Medium Term Market, when the Special Trader shall be eliminated from the procurement arrangement. If at the start of the Medium Term Market one or more Distributors have not been privatised and are not credit worthy, the Special Trader will maintain the contract guarantees through a special agreement between the Special Trader and the Distributor.

22.3.4.	The Special Trader shall procure new power and ancillary services in an open, transparent, and competitive manner, and shall evaluate procurement bids and prepare a bid selection report in accordance with the competitive procedures defined by the Commission pursuant to rule 22.2, unless the circumstances re-quire otherwise and the Commission allows or requires an alternative method.

The sales price from the Special Trader to the Distributors shall include, in addition to the contract price, administrative costs approved by the Commission.

22.3.6.	On receiving this information from the Special Trader, one or more Distributors may request the Commission to approve bilateral contracts for additional power procurement, if the conditions and sales prices proposed by the Special Trader in the new power procurement would lead to higher regulated tariffs for Consumers than the bilateral contracts proposed by the Distributor(s).

22.3.7.	If the Commission—

(a)	rejects the proposal by the Distributor(s); and

(b)	approves the competitive power procurement by the Special Trader;

(c)	all Distributors shall accept the new power procurement proposed by the Special Trader, and the Special Trader shall sign the tendered contract with the selected bidder provided that the condition in paragraph (a) shall not apply on the event that no Distributor requests the Commission to approve a bilateral contract under rule 22.3.6.

22.3.8.	The Commission shall ensure that the competitive procurement and selected bid complies with the tender conditions and competitive procedures, and shall authorize the transfer of procurement costs to Consumers through regulated end consumers tariffs.

22.3.9.	After the initiation of the Medium Term Market, the Special Trader will start the novation to Distributors or eligible customers of its purchasing contracts agreed during the Transitional Stage, and shall not enter into any new contract.

Bilateral Contracts by Distributors

22.4.1.	A Distributor may purchase Embedded Generation to provide local reliability reserves due to transmission constraints. To justify such purchase, the Com-mission shall request an evaluation by the System Operator to verify that the need for such local reserve is justified.

22.4.2.	Subject to the immediately preceding rule 22.4.1, a Distributor shall not enter into a bilateral contract with a Generator unless one or both of the following conditions have been satisfied—

(a) 	Upon receipt of a proposal for power procurement by the Special Trader, the Distributor, acting alone or in conjunction with other Distributors, proposes an alternative bilateral contract at lower prices than the prices of the new power procurement proposed by the Special Trader and the Distributor(s)’s proposal is approved by the Commission, pursuant to rule 22.3.6; or

(b)	There are transmission constraints that cause shortages in the Distribu- tor(s) coverage area and it is expected that such constraints will remain for at least five years, and the Distributor follows a competitive process, within the guidelines established by the Commission and supervised by the Commission, to procure generation installed or connected in its region.
