(b)	for their construction and maintenance;

(c)	for the supervision of users thereof; and

(4)	Where any power is delegated pursuant to subsection (3) of this section, it shall be additional to and not in derogation of any other power of the police in respect of road traffic, and the power may accordingly be sub-delegated to and be exercised by any police officer.



(5)	The powers referred to in subsection (3) of this section, are—



(a)	restriction on type or class of vehicle and vehicle inspection;



(b)	road diversion or closure where necessary as a temporary measure;



(c)	prohibition of parking or waiting as the case may be on Federal highways or on specific parking or waiting places and on space reasonably required for vehicles approaching or leav-ing premises on or immediately adjoining a Federal highway;

(6)	Penalties prescribed for the infringement of any regulations made by the Minister under the power conferred by this Act shall, apply and have effect in respect of powers delegated under and for the purposes of this section, to the like extent as if the regulations had been made contemporaneously with the operation of any such delegation as aforesaid under this section and had so provided.
