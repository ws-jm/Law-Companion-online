(2)	The reply may be signed and filed by the debtor’s solicitor, if any.



(3)	At the time of filing the reply, the debtor or his solicitor shall leave a duplicate thereof for each party to the complaint and three other duplicates thereof and pay the fees for service; and in default of such duplicates being left and such fees being paid at that time, the reply shall not be filed, unless the Court otherwise orders.



(4)	The registrar shall cause a duplicate of the reply to be served on each other party to the complaint.



11.	Admission of debt

Where the debtor admits the debt, the Court shall, on receipt of his reply, summon him to appear before the Court as specified in section 12 of this Act.



12.	Amendment of application

The relevant provisions of the Civil Procedure Rules relating to amendment of pleading shall apply to the amendment of an application as if for the words 'any proceeding' in those provisions there were substituted the words 'the application or the reply, if any”.



13.	Further particulars or direction



(1)	If any party to the application wishes to have further particulars or other directions of the Court, he may, at any time after the entry of appearance, but not later than seven days after the filing of the reply, apply to the Court specifying in his notice of motion the direction for which he prays and the motion shall, unless the Court otherwise orders, be set down for hearing on the first available day.



(2)	The party so applying shall give notice of his motion to the other parties, and where he relies on any facts which are not apparent on the face of the documents already filed, 

he shall support his motion by affidavit.



(3)	If a party does not so apply, he shall be taken to require no further particulars or other directions and such party shall de debarred from so applying after the lapse of the period laid down in sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph except with the leave of the Court, which may be given in a proper case on such terms as to costs and otherwise as the Court may be deem fit.



14.	Open Court

Every application shall be heard in open Court.



15.	Time and place of hearing



(1)	Subject to the provisions of sub-paragraph (2) of this paragraph, the time and place of the hearing of an application shall be fixed by the Court and notice of the time and place of the hearing (which may be in Form E in the Appendix to this Schedule) shall be given by the registrar at least three days before the day fixed for the hearing—



(a)	by posting or causing to be posted, the notice on the court notice board;

(b)	by sending a copy of the notice by registered post or messenger to the Receiver’s or Liquidator’s address for service;

(c)	by sending likewise a similar copy to the debtor’s address for service, if any.

[Appendix, Form E.]



(2)	The Court shall sit in such place or places as the judge may, from time to time, determine.



16.	Publication, good notice

The posting of the notice of hearing on the court notice board shall be deemed and taken to be good notice and such notice shall not be vitiated by any miscarriage of or relating to the copy or copies of the notice sent pursuant to paragraph 15 of this Schedule.



17.	Continuance day to day

No formal adjournment of the Court for the hearing of an application shall be necessary, but the hearing is to be deemed adjourned and may be continued from day to day until the case is concluded; and in the event of the judge of the Court who begins the hearing being disabled by illness or otherwise, it may be recommenced and concluded by another judge to be appointed by the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court.



18.	Adjournment

After the hearing has begun, if the case cannot be continued on the ensuing day or, if that day is a Sunday or a public holiday, on the day following the same, the hearing shall not be adjourned sine die, but to a definite day to be announced before the rising of the Court and notice of the day to which the hearing is adjourned shall forthwith be posted by the registrar on the court notice board.



19.	Powers of Federal High Court over proceedings

All interlocutory questions and matters shall be heard and disposed of before the Court which shall have control over the proceedings as a judge in the ordinary proceedings of the Court.

21.	Appeal

A judgment of the Court is subject to appeal as specified in section 5 of this Act.



22.	Enlargement and abridgement of time



(1)	The Court shall have power to enlarge or abridge the time appointed by this Act or the Rules of Court mentioned in paragraph 27 of this Schedule or fixed by any order enlarging time, for doing any act or taking any proceeding upon such terms (if any) as the justice of the case may require.



(2)	Enlargement may be ordered although the application for the enlargement is not made until after the expiration of the time appointed or allowed.



(3)	When the time for delivering any pleading or document of filing any affidavit, answer or document, or doing any act is or has been fixed or limited by any of the paragraphs or rules referred to in paragraph 1 of this rule, or by direction or order or the Court, the costs of any application to extend such time and of any order made thereon, shall be borne by the party making the application, unless the Court shall otherwise order.



(4)	An application for enlargement or abridgement of time shall be supported by affidavit.



(5)	An application for abridgement of time may be made ex parte, but the Court may require notice thereof to be given to the other party.



(6)	An application for enlargement of time shall be made by motion after notice to the other party but the Court may, for good cause shown by affidavit or otherwise, dispose with such notice.



(7)	A copy of an order made for enlargement or abridgement of time shall be filed or delivered together with any document filed or delivered by virtue of the order.



23.	Service of notice



(1)	Where any summons, notice or document, other than a notice or document mentioned in para-graph 5 (1) of this Schedule, is required to be served on any person for a purpose connected with an application, the same may be served either by delivering it to such person or by leaving it at his last known place of abode with any person there found who is a resident thereof and appears to be eighteen years of age or more.



(2)	After a party has given an address for service, it shall be sufficient if, in lieu of serving him personally with any document intended for him, such document is served—



(a) on the person appearing on the paper last filed on his behalf as his solicitor, wherever such person may be found or, if such person is not found at his office, on the clerk there apparently in charge; or



(b) on the person named as occupier in his address for service, wherever such person may be found or, if such person is not found at such address on—



(i)	the person there found apparently in charge, if such address is a place of business; or

(ii)	any person other than a domestic servant there found who is a resident thereof and ap-pears to be eighteen years of age or more.



(3)	A party may change his address for service by giving notice of his new address for service and its occupier to the registrar and to each other party; but until such notice is received by the registrar, his old address for service shall continue to be his address for service.



(4)	Where service in one of the foregoing modes has proved impracticable, the Court, on being satisfied, upon an application supported by an affidavit showing what has been done, that all reasonable effort has been made to effect service, may order that service be effected in any of the ways mentioned in the provisions of the Civil Procedure Rules relating to substituted service shall be sufficient, or may dispense with service or notice, as the Court may think fit.



24.	Duplicate of documents

In the absence of express provision for the furnishing of copies of duplicates of documents filed or used in connection with any step taken in the proceedings, the party taking such steps shall, unless the registrar otherwise directs, leave with the registrar a duplicate of every such document for each other party and three other duplicates.



25.	Non-compliance with rules, etc.



(1)	Non-compliance with any of the provisions of this Schedule, or with any rule of practice for the time being in force, shall not render any proceeding void unless the Court shall so direct, but such proceeding may be set aside either wholly or in part as irregular, or amended, or otherwise dealt with in such manner and upon such terms as the Court shall think fit to ensure substantial justice.



(2)	No application to set aside any proceeding for irregularity shall be allowed unless made within reasonable time, or if the party applying has taken any fresh step after knowledge of the irregularity.



(3)	Where an application is made to set aside proceedings for irregularity the several objectives in-tended to be insisted upon shall be stated in the notice of motion.



(4)	No objection shall be made that a certified copy has been used instead of a duplicate or a duplicate instead of a certified copy.



(5)	An application shall not be defeated by any objection merely as to form.



26.	Forms



(1)	The forms contained in the Appendix to these Rules may, in accordance with any instructions contained in the said forms, and with such variation as the circumstances of the particular case may require, be used for the matter to which they apply, and when so used, shall be good and sufficient in law.



(2)	Where no form has been prescribed in this Schedule for a particular matter, the forms as contained in the Civil Procedure Rules of the Court may, with such modifications as the circumstances may require, be used for the matter.



27.	Application of Rules of Court

Where these Rules contain no provision in respect of any matter relating to or connected with the hearing of a case under this Act, the provisions of the Civil Procedure Rules of the Court shall, with such modifications as may be necessary to render them conveniently applicable, apply as if the applicant and the respondent were respectively the plaintiff and the defendant in a civil action.
