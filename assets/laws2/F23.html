of such proportion of his emoluments that might have been withheld) as the Council may determine.



(5)	In any case where the Council, pursuant to this section, decides to continue a person’s suspension or decides to take further disciplinary action against a person, the Council shall before the expiration of a period of three months from such decision come to a final determination in respect of the case concerning any such person.

(3)	The fact that an appeal from a direction is brought in pursuance of subsection (2) of this section shall not affect the operation of the direction while the appeal is pending.



(4)	The Vice-Chancellor may delegate his powers under this section to a disciplinary board consisting of such members of the University as he may nominate.
