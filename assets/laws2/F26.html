CHAPTER F26



FINANCE (CONTROL AND MANAGEMENT) ACT



SUBSIDIARY LEGISLATION



List of Subsidiary Legislation



1.	Financial Regulations.



FINANCIAL REGULATIONS



(REVISED TO JANUARY, 2009)



PREFACE



1.	This Edition of the Financial Regulations is the second since the commencement of the present democratic dispensation in 1999. The issue of this edition is borne out of the concern of government to ensure that requisite rules and regulations that would guarantee probity and transparency in the control and management of public funds and resources of government are put in place.



2.	Since the Year 2000 when the Financial Regulations were last reviewed and published, the conduct of Government business has undergone many transformations. The complexity which Government business has assumed since the inception of democratic governance made it necessary to take a closer look, once again, at the Financial Regulations by which Government Finance and Accounting procedures are regulated. This review, and indeed the changes in the philosophy of management of Government business are designed to promote honesty and transparency. Of particular note in this regard are the Chapters on Public Procurement of Goods and Services and the Codification of Offences and Sanctions.



3.	On the part of Ministers, it is mandatory that they ensure that any decision taken by them is correct, unexceptionable and in the public interest. In this regard they should insist that any recommendation put before them is supported by the relevant provision of an extant Act or Regulation.



4.	Public Officers are enjoined to acquaint themselves with these Regulations, the Finance (Control and Management) Act, Cap, 144 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 1990, as well as the relevant Sections of the Constitution dealing with public finance for proper guidance.

414.	Unspent balances to lapse with financial year



The date of payment shall be the date of the record of the charge in the accounts, except as otherwise specifically authorised by the Accountant-General. Under no circumstances shall anticipated savings be utilised for payments before they are due. Likewise the unexpended portion of any sub-head shall not be drawn for the purpose of setting it in reserve to meet impending payments, or be carried to a deposit or a suspense account. On the other hand, expenditure properly chargeable to the account of a given year must, as far as possible, be met within the year, and must not be deferred or placed in suspense for the purpose of avoiding an excess on the amount provided in the Estimates. Unallocated stores may not be drawn for use before they are required in order to utilise provision in the Estimates which would otherwise lapse at the end of the financial year.

(b)	The information furnished on the voucher is correct, the certificates on voucher completed where necessary and the vouchers signed by the appropriate officer.



(c)	All deductions from salaries such as pensions staff contributions, repayment of advances, or other liabilities have been duly made. (see also Regulations 609 and 611).



421.	Alteration in Classification



The classification of a voucher shall not be changed arbitrarily by a checking officer or Sub- Accounting Officer. An alteration to the classification of a voucher shall only be effected by the officer controlling expenditure who will amend his Vote Book accordingly.



422.	Expenditure: Settlement within Financial Year

CHAPTER 21



Stores Accounting and Custody



PART I



Stores -classification and general



2101.	Stores: Definition



Stores include all movable property purchased from public funds or otherwise acquired by government.



2102.	Stores: Classification



For accounting purposes, stores are of two classes, namely Allocated and Unallocated Stores. They are further divided into three categories which, after issue, are dealt with according to the nature of the article, defined as follows—



(a) Non-expendable stores; e.g., plant and machinery, motor vehicles, typewriters, scales and furniture.



(b)	Expendable stores: e.g., shovels, machetes, brushes.



(c)	Consumable stores: e.g., paint, soap and food-stuffs.



2103.	Allocated Stores



Allocated Stores are stores the costs of which are chargeable direct to, and remain a charge to, the sub-head of expenditure in which funds for their purchase are provided in the estimates. These stores are taken on numerical charge and may be placed in an Allocated Stores or put into immediate use. They may be either purchased direct or obtained from the Unallocated Stores Stocks.



2104.	Unallocated Stores



Unallocated Stores are those purchased for general stock rather than for a particular work or service, for which the final vote of charge cannot be stated at the time of purchase. Their cost is debited to an Unallocated Stores sub-head in the Expenditure Estimates. They are held on charge by both value and unit and when issued for use are charged to the appropriate sub-head of expenditure as an Allocated Store, and the corresponding credit is posted to the Unallocated Stores sub-heads.



2105.	Storage According to classification.



Allocated and Unallocated Stores should preferably be stored in separate premises. Where this is not possible, separate areas should be maintained within the same store.



PART II



Stores: Books and Forms of Accounts

The Control Register shall be maintained by a senior officer other than the Storekeeper, who will be responsible either for ensuring that the loose-leaf sheets are properly and serially numbered on receipt from the printer, or for seeing that such sheets are numbered in his office immediately on receipt with a numbering stamp which he shall keep personally under lock and key. He shall also be responsible for issuing new sheets as required and recording in the control register the stores ledger folio number given to each on coming into use. Keys to loose- leaf ledgers and locking devices for card cabinets shall be kept personally by this officer.



(ii)	Each sheet in use shall be given same folio number on both sides and when a replacement sheet of any one item is inserted for one that is exhausted, in brackets, e.g., 5 (2).

CHAPTER 25



Loss or Shortage of Government Funds



PART I



Losses of Funds-Procedure



2501. Definition of Losses



Loss or shortage of fund is a depletion of government fund at a given time. This can arise from any of (but not limited to) the following—



(a)	Misappropriation of funds



(b)	Falsification of records.



(c)	Conversion of funds to personal use.



(d)	False claims.



(e)	Fraudulent payments.



(f)	Theft



(g)	Negligence.



2502.	Losses of Funds: Procedures











(i)  Where a cash loss to the value of N50.000 or below has occurred without fraud or theft being involved, Accounting Officers are personally empowered to surcharge the officers responsible up to the full amount of the loss, provided the officer is not above Grade Level 10. Accounting Officers are personally responsible for ensuring that all surcharges they authorise are duly recovered. For officers above GL. 10 the loss should be reported to the Accountant-General.



(ii)	Where a loss is treated under this Regulation, Accounting Officers must immediately send a brief report of the circumstances including the value of the loss and the names of the officers he has surcharged, together with the amounts of the surcharge in each case to—



(a)	The Chairman, Federal Civil Service Commission,



(b)	The Auditor-General,



(c)	The Accountant-General,

A surcharge is not a disciplinary measure and it can be made at any time whether or not disciplinary proceedings are being taken in respect of the circumstance leading to the surcharge. A surcharge can be justified whenever there is a degree of culpability, even though the same degree of culpability would not support the disciplinary charge for negligence or inefficiency. A degree of negligence which though proved, does not in fact contribute to a loss or to its non-detection cannot support a surcharge in respect of that loss. For a surcharge to be made there should be some degree of negligence or culpability on the part of the officer concerned which contributes to the loss positively or negatively.



2503.	Loss of over N50,000.00

(e)	Ensure that the accounting entries as prescribed in F.R. 2524 and 2525 have been made.



(ii)	If the loss is of cash which must be replaced immediately in order to meet urgent commitments, e.g. the payment of salaries or leave transport expenses, as an interim measure, payment voucher may be prepared for the sum required, classified to Head 1800 - Advances: Non-Personal and cashed at the Treasury, or Cash Office in the case of a selfaccounting department.

(iv)	Chairman, Federal Civil Service Commission.
