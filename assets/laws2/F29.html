Enlistment and service



7.	Enlistment

Every fireman shall, on appointment, be enlisted to serve in the Fire Service for three years, or for such other period as may be fixed by the Federal Civil Service Commission to be reckoned in all cases from the day on which he has been approved for service and taken on to the strength.



8.	Re-engagement

(1)	Any fireman of good character may within six months before completion of his first period of enlistment and with the prescribed approval, re-engage to serve for a further period of six years and may similarly re-engage for a second period of six years, and may thereafter similarly re-engage either to serve until the expiration of a third period of six years or until he reaches the age of forty-five years (whichever is earlier).

(2)	Upon completion of such third period of six years, or if he has re-engaged until reaching the age of forty-five years then upon reaching such age, the fireman may if he so desires and with the prescribed approval continue in the Fire Service in the same manner in all respects as if his term of service were still unexpired, except that he may be discharged or may claim a discharge upon six months prescribed notice thereof being given to or by him.

(3)	The prescribed approval referred to in subsections (1) and (2) of this section shall be that of the Federal Civil Service Commission or of any member of the Fire Service to whom the Federal Civil Service Commission has delegated the power to give such approval, and the prescribed notice referred to in subsection (2) of this section shall be given by or to the Federal Civil Service Commission or by or to any member of the Fire Service to whom the Federal Civil Service Commission has duly delegated the power of giving or receiving such notice.

(4)	If a fireman offers to re-engage within six months after having received his discharge he will, if his offer of service is accepted, on re-engagement be entitled to the rank which he was holding at the time of his discharge, provided there is a vacancy in the establishment of that rank at the time he reengages.

(5)	If, however, no vacancy exists in the establishment of that rank at that time as in subsection (4) of this section, the fireman may be appointed to the nearest lower rank in the establishment of which a vacancy exists; and he shall be entitled to promotion to the rank he was holding at the time of his discharge as soon after his re-engagement as a vacancy arises in the establishment of that rank.

(6)	The service of a fireman who has re-engaged under this section shall be deemed to be continuous for the purposes of pension or annual allowance or gratuities, as the case may be, the fireman being regarded as on leave without pay during the period between discharge and re-engagement.

(7)	No fireman may apply for re-engagement after a period of six months has elapsed since his discharge, but a fireman may be permitted to re-enlist subsequent to that period if his offer of service is accepted.

(8)	The question of the reinstatement of a re-enlisted fireman to the rank he held prior to his discharge shall be decided by the Fire Commissioner.

(9)	Any fireman whose term of service expires during the declaration of a state of emergency, insurrection, or hostilities, may be compulsorily retained and his service prolonged for such period, not exceeding twelve months, as the Federal Civil Service Commission may direct.

(10)	Subject to the provisions of sections 3 (1) (a) and 21 of the Pensions Act and to the provisions of subsection (2) of this section, no fireman shall be at liberty to resign or withdraw himself from his duties without the approval of the Federal Civil Service Commission or of any member of the Fire Service to whom the Federal Civil Service Commission has delegated the power to give such approval.

[Cap. P19.]

(2)	For the purposes of this Act the length of service in the Nigeria Police Force of such transferred police officer shall be deemed to be length of service in the Fire Service.

(3)	The conditions, of service of any such transferred police officer shall not, during the period in which he retains the rank in the Fire Service to which he was initially appointed at the date of his transfer, be altered or amended in such a manner or to such an extent as to render such conditions of service less advantageous to the said transferred police officer than they would have been should he have not so transferred and have remained a member of the Nigeria Police Force under the conditions of service applicable to police officers, under the Police Act, at the date of his transfer to the Fire Services.

(4)	Whether any alteration of or amendment to the conditions of service of the Fire Service constitutes an infringement of the provisions of subsection (3) of this section shall be determined by the Federal Civil Service Commission.

(5)	If the Federal Civil Service Commission determines that an alteration of or amendment to the conditions of service constitutes an infringement of the provisions of subsection (3) of this section they shall, as soon as is convenient, notify the Fire Commissioner of their decision. Whereupon the Fire Commissioner shall give notice in writing of such decision to each transferred police officer who is then serving in the rank to which he was initially appointed at the date of his transfer.

(6)	Any such transferred police officer affected by such altered or amended conditions of service may, within one month from the date of his receipt of the notice from the Fire Commissioner under subsection (5) of this section, elect to—

{a) accept the altered or amended conditions of service and continue to serve subject thereto; or

(b)	resign from the Fire Service.

(7)	In the event of a transferred police officer resigning from the Fire Service under the provisions of subsection (6) (b) of this section, the said transferred police officer shall, for the purposes of gratuities, annual allowances and pensions under this Act, be deemed to have completed the full term of his enlistment at the date of his resignation.

(8)	For the purpose of this section, the words 'transferred police officer' mean a member of the Nigeria Police Force who has transferred to the Fire Service under the provisions of subsection (1) of this section.

(2)	Subject to the provisions of this section, there shall be paid to a fireman on discharge after continuous good service extending over a period of not less than three years a gratuity calculated at a rate of one-half of a month’s pay at the rate pertaining at the date of discharge for each completed year of service, and in addition he may be granted the following retiring benefits—

(a)	on completion of ten or more years continuous service—

(i)	subject to his having reached the age of forty-five years or being required to retire on medical grounds, an annual allowance calculated at one nine hundred and sixtieth of this annual emolument at the date of retirement for each completed month of service; or

(ii)	a gratuity calculated at one twentieth of a month’s pay for each completed month of service;

(b)	on completion of five years less than ten years continuous service a gratuity calculated at one twentieth of a month’s pay for each completed month of service.

(3)	Where a fireman has rendered at least twenty-five years good service and has attained the age of forty-five years but whose service has not been continuous, the Minister may, in his discretion, treat such service, for the purpose of calculation of the annual allowance and gratuities for which the fireman might otherwise have been eligible under subsection (2) of this section on final discharge, as continuous service, provided that there shall be deducted from any gratuities so granted any sums previously paid to such fireman by way of gratuities, and further provided that any annual allowance previously granted under subsection (2) of this section shall have been suspended during any such further period of service.

(4)	Where the service of a fireman has not been such as to justify the payment of the full annual allowance and gratuities on discharge for which he would otherwise have been eligible, the Minister may, on the recommendation of the Fire Commissioner approve the award of such reduced annual allowance and gratuities as he may deem just.

(5)	Where a fireman has completed more than six years continuous service and is discharged as unfit for further services or on reduction of establishment, he shall receive on discharge such proportion as the Minister may deem just of the annual allowance and gratuities for which he would otherwise have been eligible had he attained the age of forty-five years at the date of his discharge.

(6)	Where a fireman who has completed more than three years continuous service dies while serving in the Fire Service, the gratuities for which he would have been otherwise eligible under the provision of this section shall be calculated to the date of death and the Minister may cause such gratuities to be paid to or for the benefit of the dependants or next-of-kin of such fireman, and if such gratuities are paid to or for the benefit of more than one person, in such proportion as the Minister may deem just.

(7)	Where a fireman dies while serving in the Fire Service before he has completed three years continuous service, the Minister may, on the recommendation of the Fire Commissioner, award gratuities calculated on the rate of pay pertaining at the date of the death of such fireman bearing such proportion to the gratuities for which he would otherwise have been eligible had he completed six years service at the said rate of pay as the number of years of actual service bears to six years and where any such gratuities are awarded the provisions for the payment of gratuities under subsection (6) of this section shall apply to the payment of such gratuities.



11.	Loss of annual allowance of pension on conviction

(d)	if after conviction a person whose annual allowance or pension has ceased under this section

is granted a free pardon, such annual allowance or pension shall be restored with effect from the date of conviction; but in determining whether arrears of such allowance of pension are payable to such person and in computing the amount thereof, account shall be taken of all moneys paid or applied under the provisions of paragraph (b) or (c) of this subsection.
