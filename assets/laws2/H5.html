[No. 17 of 1965.]

[Date of commencement: 11th June, 1965]

[L.N. 71 of 1965.]

1.	Refiner’s licence

Subject to the provisions of this Act, no person shall refine any hydrocarbon oils save in a refinery and under a licence issued under this Act (hereunder referred to as 'a refiner’s licence”).

2.	Application for refiner’s licence

An application for a refiner’s licence may be made by any person in the prescribed form and manner to the Nigerian Customs Service Board (in this Act referred to as 'the Board”) in respect of the premises mentioned in that behalf in the application.

3.	Grant of application

If the Board, after due enquiry, is satisfied that the premises mentioned in an application and intended to be used by the applicant as a refinery are in such a state and contains such equipment as would enable proper control for excise purposes to be exercised over activities to be carried on therein, the Board shall, on payment of a fee of five hundred naira, issue to the applicant a refiner’s licence in the prescribed form in respect of such premises.

4.	Refusal to grant application

(1)	If the Board, after the enquiry, is not satisfied as required by section 3 of this Act in respect of the premises to which the application relates, the Board may refuse to grant the application, and shall notify the applicant in writing of such refusal.

(2)	A notification by the Board under subsection (1) of this section of its refusal to grant an application shall contain particulars of what the Board considers necessary to be done in respect of the premises before the application can be granted.

5.	Revocation of licence

(1)	If at any time during the currency of a refiner’s licence the Board is satisfied that—

(a)	proper control for excise purposes can no longer be exercised over the premises; or

(a)	that the person to whom the licence was granted has ceased to refine hydrocarbon oils on such premises,

the Board may revoke the licence.

(2)	The Board shall notify a licence-holder in writing of the revocation of his licence under subsection (1) of this section.

6.	Expiration and renewal of licence

(1)	A refiner’s licence issued under this Act shall, unless previously revoked, remain in force until 31st December next following the date of issue, and shall then expire.

(2)	An application for the renewal of a refiner’s licence may be made to the Board in the prescribed form and manner by the person to whom the licence was issued and the provisions of sections 3 and 4 of this Act shall apply to such application as they apply to an application made under section 2 of this Act.

7.	Offences under section 1 of this Act

(1)	Any person who refines hydrocarbon oils in contravention of the provisions of section 1 of this Act shall be guilty of an offence, and shall be liable—

(a) on summary conviction, to a fine of not less than four hundred naira or more than two thousand naira or to imprisonment for a term of two years, or to both;

(b)	on conviction on indictment, to a fine of an unlimited amount or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, or to both.

(2)	Any hydrocarbon oils in respect of the refining of which a person is convicted of an offence under this section shall be liable to forfeiture.

8.	Making of entries

(1)	The holder of a refiner’s licence shall make entry of any premises or articles to which the licence relates as the excise laws may require, and such entry shall be made in the form and manner and contain the particulars prescribed by the Board, and the premises and articles shall be, and be kept, marked in such manner as the Board may direct.

(2)	No such entry as aforesaid shall be valid unless the person by whom it was made—

(a)	had at the time of its making attained the age of twenty-one years; and

(b)	was at that time and is for the time being carrying on the business of refining hydrocarbon oils in the premises in respect of which the entry was made.

(3)	Where any person required to make entry is a body corporate—

(a)	the entry shall be signed by a director, general manager, secretary or other similar officer of

the body and, except where authority for that person to sign has been given under the seal of the body, shall be made under that seal; and

(b)	both the body corporate and the person by whom the entry is signed shall be liable for all duties charged in respect of the trade to which the entry relates.

(4)	If any person making entry of any premises or article contravenes or fails to comply with any direction of the Board given under this section with respect thereto he shall be guilty of an offence punishable on conviction by a fine of four hundred naira.

9.	New or further entries of same premises

(1)	The Board may at any time, by notice in writing to the person by whom any existing entry was signed addressed to him at any premises entered by him, require a new entry to be made of any premises or article to which the existing entry relates, and the existing entry shall, without prejudice to any liability incurred, become void at the expiration of fourteen days from the delivery of the notice. 

(2)	Save as permitted by the Board and subject to such conditions as it may impose, no premises or article of which entry has been made by any person shall, while that entry remains in force, be entered by any other person for any purpose of the excise laws, and any entry made in contravention of this subsection shall be void.

(3)	Where the person by whom entry has been made of any premises absconds or quits possession of the premises and discontinues the trade in respect of which the entry was made, and the Board permits a further entry to be made of the premises by some other person, the former entry shall be deemed to have been withdrawn and shall be void.

10.	Proof as to entries

For the purpose of any proceedings before any court, if any question arises as to whether or not entry under the excise laws has been made by any person of any premises or article, or for any purpose, then—

(a)	if a document purporting to be an original made by the person, or of the premises or article, or for the purpose, in question is produced to the court by an officer, that document shall, until the contrary is proved, be sufficient evidence that the entry was so made; and

(b)	if the officer in whose custody any such entry, if made, would be, gives evidence that the original entries produced by him to the court constitute all those in his custody and that no such entry as is in question is among them, it shall be deemed, until the contrary is proved, that no such entry has been made.

11.	Offences in connection with entries

(1)	If any person being the holder of refiner’s licence issued under this Act uses, for any purpose of his trade, any premises or article required by this Act to be entered for that purpose without entry thereof having been duly made, he shall be guilty of an offence punishable on conviction by a fine of one thousand naira, and any goods found on such premises shall be liable to forfeiture.

(2)	If any person who has made entry of any premises or article fraudulently uses those premises or that article for any purpose other than that for which entry thereof was made, he shall be guilty of an offence punishable on conviction by a fine of one thousand naira.

12.	Power to enter upon premises for inspection purposes

(1)	An officer may at any time enter upon any premises to which a refiner’s licence relates for the purposes of inspecting the premises and may examine and take account of any equipment, meters, vessels, utensils, goods or materials used for or in any way connected with the refining of hydrocarbon oils.

(2)	Where an officer, after having demanded admission into any such premises as aforesaid, and declared his name and business at the entrance thereto, is not immediately admitted, that officer and any person acting in his aid may break open any door or window of such premises or break through any wall thereof for the purpose of entering the premises.

13.	Payment of excise duty

(1)	Every holder of a refiner’s licence shall pay any duty of excise payable in respect of any hydrocarbon oils refined by him at or within such time, at such place and to such person as the Board may direct, whether or not the payment of that duty has been secured by bond or otherwise.

(2)	If any excise duty payable is not paid as aforesaid, it shall be paid on demand made by the Board either to the holder of the refiner’s licence personally or by delivering the demand in writing at his place of abode or the premises to which his licence relates, and, if it is not so paid on demand, the licence-holder, unless he can show that the demand was not so made or delivered shall, in addition to the amount of the excise duty, be liable to a penalty equal to twice the amount thereof or six hundred naira whichever is the greater.

14.	Effect of variation in balances struck or excess, etc., in stock of materials

(1)	If at any time when an account is taken by the proper officer and a balance is struck of the quantity of refined hydrocarbon oils in the possession of the holder of the refiner’s licence, that quantity differs from the quantity thereof which ought to be kept in his possession according to any account required by this Act to be kept, the following provisions shall apply—

(a)	if the former quantity exceeds the latter, the excess shall be liable to forfeiture; and

(b)	if the former quantity is less than the latter, the holder of the refiner’s licence shall be liable

on summary conviction to a fine equal to twice the amount of the excise duty which would be payable on the quantity of refined hydrocarbon oils equal to that on the deficiency or six hundred naira, whichever is the greater.

(2)	At any time when an account is taken by the proper officer and a balance is struck of the stock of materials, the following provisions shall apply—

(a)	if any excess is found, or goods not authorised for use as materials are discovered in the stock, such excess or goods shall be liable to forfeiture; and

(b)	if any deficiency is found which cannot be accounted for to the satisfaction of the Board, the quantity or value of materials representing such deficiency shall be deemed to have been used in manufacture and, in any particular case, duty shall be charged on the quantity or value of excisable goods reckoned to have been purchased with such quantity or value of materials.

15.	Power to enter on premises, etc., in case of unlawful refining

If any officer has reasonable grounds to suspect that any refining of hydrocarbon oils contrary to the provisions of this Act is being carried out on any land or premises, he may enter thereon, if need be by force, and dismantle or seize any apparatus and equipment used for or in connection with such unlawful refining.

16.	Power to seize goods in particular cases

Where any refined hydrocarbon oils subject to excise duty become liable to forfeiture under this Act, but such products are not available in sufficient quantity for forfeiture, the Board may seize from the stock of the holder of the refiner’s licence, any quantity of such products available or materials capable of conversion into such products of such quantity as would attract up to the same amount of duty as that on the refined hydrocarbon oils liable to forfeiture.

17.	Forfeiture and condemnation of refined hydrocarbon oil seized

(1)	Any officer, police officer, or person authorised in that behalf by the Board may at any time seize or detain any refined hydrocarbon oils liable to forfeiture under this Act or which such officer, or person so authorised has reasonable grounds to believe are so liable to forfeiture.
