(1)	Subject to the provisions of this section, this Act shall apply to persons entering or leaving Ni-geria and to persons who are at any time therein after the commencement of this Act.

(2)	Nothing in this section shall be construed—

(a) to require any Minister of the Federal Government or any Commissioner of any State Government to complete entry or embarkation cards on entering or leaving Nigeria;

(b)	to impose any restriction or liability under this Act as to entry or deportation in respect of persons who satisfy an immigration officer that they are entitled under any rule of law or en-actment to immunity from suit or legal process not being immunity in respect only of things done or omitted to be done in the course of their duties, and complete any other requirement of this Act before entry or departure;

(c)	in respect of any particular requirement, to affect persons exempted therefrom by the Minister under this Act;

(d)	to prohibit the entry of any person who satisfies an immigration officer as to his identity as a citizen of Nigeria or as the holder of a valid travel document or that he is a person in the em-ploy of the Federal Government or any State Government, as the case may be;

(e)	to authorise the deportation from Nigeria of any citizen of Nigeria;

(f)	to exempt any person from medical examination if required by the immigration officer.

(3)	Where a person enters Nigeria as an exempted person under this Act and while in Nigeria there-after ceases to be entitled to such exemption, he shall as soon as possible report the fact in writing to the Director of Immigration, and this Act shall have effect as if the person ceasing to be exempted were a person desirous of entering Nigeria for the first time and the Director of Immigration may, if he thinks fit, refer the case to the Minister or may deal with the case himself.

(4)	A person affected by subsection (3) of this section may, in the discretion of the Minister or such officer as the case may require, be issued with a permit to remain in Nigeria and if a permit is refused, the person affected shall be deemed to be a prohibited immigrant, and may be dealt with accordingly.

2.	Examination of persons landing or embarking

(1)	It shall be the duty of every person entering or leaving Nigeria to report to an immigration officer for examination, and to furnish such information in his possession as that officer may reasonably require for the purposes of this Act; and the immigration officer may refuse admission in any proper case.

(b)	produce to the officer any document of any such description which he is carrying or conveying,

and the power to examine any such person shall include power to search him and any baggage belonging to him or under his control with a view to ascertaining whether he is carrying or conveying any such documents; but nothing in subsection (1) of this section shall authorise the search of any woman or girl except by a woman.

(3)	An immigration officer may examine, and may detain for such time as he thinks proper for the purposes of examination (not exceeding seven days), any document produced pursuant to or found on a search under this section.

3.	Passenger lists and medical examination, etc.

(2)	Any immigrant or transit passenger named in any such list whose international certificates of health fail to comply with the requirements of the Director of Immigration or whose state of health the immigration officer has cause to suspect, shall submit to such medical examination or vaccination as a medical inspector may reasonably require.

4.	Production of travel documents

(1)	Unless otherwise prescribed—

(a)	every passenger who enters or leaves Nigerian by any means at or from any recognised port, shall in any proper case produce to an immigration officer, landing or embarkation cards in such form as the Minister may by order direct the owners or agents of ships and aircraft to supply to passengers, and shall satisfy the immigration officer that he is the holder of a valid travel document;

(b)	every member of the crew of a ship or aircraft who lands in or leaves Nigeria shall produce such evidence or travel document as an immigration officer may require.
