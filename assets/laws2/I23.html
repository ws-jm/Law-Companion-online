(a) in the case of an enactment contained in an Act of the National Assembly, on the day when the Act is passed;

(b)	in any other case, on the day when the enactment is made.

(3)	Where an enactment is expressed to come into force on a particular day, it shall be construed as coming into force immediately on the expiration of the previous day.

3.	Punctuation, headings and descriptive words

(1)	Punctuation forms part of an enactment, and regard shall be had to it accordingly in construing the enactment.

(2)	A heading or marginal note to an enactment does not form part of the enactment and is intended for convenience of reference only.

4.	Amended and substituted enactments

(1)	A reference in an enactment to another enactment shall, if the other enactment has been amended, be construed as a reference to the other enactment as amended.

(2)	Where an enactment is repealed and another enactment is substituted for it, then—

(a)	the repealed enactment shall remain in force until the substituted enactment comes into force;

(b)	any reference to the repealed enactment shall, after the substituted enactment comes into force, be construed as a reference to the substituted enactment;

(c)	any subsidiary instrument in force by virtue of the repealed enactment shall,	so far as	the

pursuance of the substituted enactment.

5.	Construction of references to portions of enactments
