CHAPTER III

Requirements for Minimising Oil Tanker Spillage due to Side and Bottom Damages

REGULATION 22

Damage Assumptions

(1) For the purpose of calculating hypothetic oil outflow from oil tankers, three dimensions of the ex-tent of damage of a parallelepiped on the side and bottom of the ship are assumed as follows. In the case of bottom damages two conditions are set forth to be applied individually to the state of the oil tanker—

(a)	side damage—

(i)	Longitudinal extent (lc);

(ii)	Transverse extent (tc) (inboard from the ship’s side at right angles to the centerline at the level corresponding to the assigned summer freeboard);

(iii)	 Vertical extent (Vc);	From the base line upwards without limit 

(b)	Bottom damage—

For 0.3L from the forward per-	Any other part of the ship

pendicular of the ship

(i)	 Longitudinal L/10 extent (Is):	L/10 or 5 meters, whichever is less

(ii)	 Transverse extent (ts) but not less	B/6 or 10 metres, whichever is less, than 5 metres

(iii)	Vertical extent B/l5 or 6 metres, which ever is less from the base line (Vs):

(2)	wherever the symbols given in this Regulation appear in this Chapter, they have the meaning as defined in this Regulation.

REGULATION 23

Hypothetical Outflow of Oil

(1) The hypothetical outflow of oil in the case of side damage (Oc) and bottom damage (Os) shall be calculated by the following formulae with respect to compartments breached by damage to all conceivable locations along the length of the ship to the extent as defined in regulation 22 of this Annex—

(2)	If a void space or segregated ballast tank of a length less than Ci in formula (I) may be calculated on the basis of volume Wi being the actual volume of one such tank (where they are of equal capacity) or the smaller of the two tanks (if they differ in capacity) adjacent to such space multiplied by Si as defined below and taking for all other wing tanks involved in such a collision the value of the actual full volume.

Si =	I-Ii/Ic

Where Ii =	length in meters of void space or segregated ballast tank under consideration.

(3)	(a) Credit shall only be given in respect of double bottom tanks which are either empty or carrying clean water when cargo is carried in the tanks above. 

(h) Where the double bottom does not extend for the full length and width of the tank involved, the double bottom is considered non existent and the volume of the tanks above the area of the bottom damage shall be included in formula (II) even if the tank is not considered breached because of the installation of such a partial double bottom.

(c)	Suction wells may be neglected in the determination of the value Hi; provided such wells are not excessive in mea extend below the tank for a minimum distance and in no case more than half the height of the double bottom. If the depth of such a well exceeds half the height of the double bottom Hi shall be taken equal to the double bottom height minus the well height.

Piping serving such wells if installed within the double bottom shall be fitted with values or other closing arrangements located at the point of connection to the tank. Served to prevent oil outflow in the event of damage to the piping. Such piping shall be kept closed at sea at any time when the tank contains oil cargo, except that they may be opened only for cargo transfer needed for the purpose of trimming of the ship.

(4)	In the case where bottom damage simultaneously involves four centre tanks, the value of Os = Sum ((Zi)(Ci))4 (III).

(5)	An Administration may credit as reducing oil outflow in case of bottom damage, an installed cargo transfer system having an emergency high suction in each cargo oil tank, capable of transferring from a breached tank or tanks to segregated ballast tanks or to available cargo tank age if it can be assured that such tanks will transfer in two hours of operation oil equal to one half of the largest of the breached tanks involved and by availability of equivalent receiving capacity in ballast or cargo tanks. The credit shall be confined to permitting calculation of Os according to formula (III). The pipes for such suctions shall be installed at least at a height not less than the vertical extent of the bottom damage Vs. The Administration shall supply the Organisation with the information concerning the arrangements accepted by it, for circulation to other parties to the Convention.

REGULATION 24

Limitation of Size and Arrangement of Cargo Tanks

(1)	Every new oil tanker shall comply with the provisions of this Regulation every existing oil tanker shall be required, within two years after the date of entry into force of the present Convention, to comply with the provision of this Regulation if such a tanker falls into either of the following categories—

(a) a tanker, the delivery of which is after 1 January, 1977; or

(b) a tanker to which both the following conditions apply—

(i)	delivery is not later than 1 January, 1977; and

(ii)	the building contract is placed after 1 January, 1974, or in case where no building contract has previously been placed, the keel is laid or the tanker is at a similar stage of construction after 30 June, 1974.

(2)	Cargo tanks of oil tanker shall be of such size and arrangements that the hypothetical outflow Oc or Os calculated in accordance with the provisions of regulation 23 of this Annex anywhere in the length of the ship does not exceed 30,000 cubic metres or (400* cubic root (DW)), where is the greater, but subject to a maximum of 40,000 cubic meters.

(3)	The volume of any one wing cargo oil tank of an oil tanker shall not exceed seventy-five per cent of the limits of the hypothetical oil outflow referred to in paragraph (2) of this Regulation. The volume of any one centre cargo oil tank shall not exceed 50,000 cubic metres. However, in segregated ballast oil tankers as defined in regulation 13 of this Annex, the permitted volume of a wing cargo oil tank situated between two segregated ballast tanks, each exceeding Ic in length, may be increase to the maximum limit of hypothetical oil outflow provided that the width of the wing tanks exceeds tc values, whichever is the greater—

(a)	where no longitudinal bulkhead is provided inside the cargo tanks—

(0.25bi/B+0.1)L but not to exceed 0.2L

(b) where a centerline longitudinal bulkhead is provided inside the cargo tanks— (0.25bi/B+0.15)L, 

(c) where two or more longitudinal bulkheads are provided inside the cargo tanks—

(i)	for wing cargo tanks: 0.2L

(ii)	for centre cargo tanks—

(1)	if bi/B is equal to or greater than fifth: 0.2L

(2)	if bi/B is less than one fifth—

where no centerline longitudinal bulkhead is provided—

(0.5bi/B+0.1)L

where no centerline longitudinal bulkhead is provided—

(0.25bi/B+0.15)L

(d) 'bi' is the minimum distance from the ship’s side to the outer longitudinal bulkhead of the tank in question measured inboard at right angles to the centerline at the level corresponding to the assigned summer freeboard.

(5)	In order not to exceed the volume limits established by paragraphs (2), (3) and (4) of this Regula-tion and irrespective of the accepted type of cargo transfer system installed, when such system interconnects two or more cargo tanks, valves or other similar closing devices shall be provided for separating the tanks from each other. These valves or devices shall be closed when the tanker is at sea.

(EDITORIAL NOTE: Numbering as per Gazette.)

(6)	Lines of piping which run through cargo tanks in a position less than vc from the ship’s side or less than Vc from the ship’s bottom shall be fitted with valves or similar closing devices at the point at which they open into any cargo tank. These values shall be kept closed at sea at any time when the tanks contain cargo oil, except that they may be opened only for cargo transfer needed for the purpose of trimming of the ship.

REGULATION 25

Sub-division and Stability

(1)	Every new oil tanker shall comply with the subdivision and damage stability criteria as specified in paragraph (3) of this Regulation, after the assumed side or bottom damage as specified in paragraph (2) of this Regulation, for any Operating draught reflecting actual partial or full load conditions consistent with trim and strength of the ship as well as specific gravities of the cargo. Such damage shall be applied to all conceivable location along the length of the ship as follows—

(a) in tankers of more than 225 metres in length, anywhere in the ship’s length;

(b)	in tankers of more than 150 metres but exceeding 225 metres in length, anywhere in the ship’s length except involving either after of forward bulkhead bounding the machinery space located aft or the machinery space shall be treated as a single floodable compartment;

(c)	in tankers not exceeding 150 metres in length, anywhere in the ship’s length between adjacent traverse bulkheads with the exception of the machinery space. For tankers of 100 metres or less in length where all requirements of paragraph (3) of this Regulation cannot be fulfilled without materially impairing the operational qualities of the ship, Administrations may allow relaxations from these requirements.

Ballast conditions where the tanker is not carrying oil in cargo tanks excluding any oil residue, shall not be considered.

(2)	The following provisions regarding the extent and the character of the assumed damage shall apply— (a) side damage

(i)	Longitudinal extent	(Lexp (2/3))/3 or 14.5 metres, whichever is less

(ii)	Transverse extent	B/S or 11.5 metres, whichever is less

(Inboard from the ship’s side at

right angles to the centerline at the level of the summer load line):

(iii)	Vertical extent	from the moulded line of the bottom shell plat

ing at centerline, upwards without limit; 

(Lexp (2/3))/3 or 5 metres, whichever is less

B/6 or 10 metres, B/6 or 5 metres, whichever is less

B/15 or 6 metres, whichever is less measured from the moulded line of the bottom of shell planting at centreline;

(c)	if any damage of a lesser extent than the maximum extent of damage specified in sub- paragraphs (a) and (b) of this paragraph would result in a more severe condition, such damage shell be considered;

(d)	where the damage involving transverse bulkheads is envisaged as specified in sub-paragraph (1) (a) and (b) of this Regulation, transverse watertight bulkheads shall be spaced at least at a distance equal to the longitudinal extent of assumed damage specified in sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph in order to be effective. Where transverse bulkheads are at a lesser distance, one or more of these bulkheads within such extent of damage shall be assumed as non existent for the purpose of determining flooded compartments;

(e)	where the damage between adjacent transverse watertight bulkheads is envisaged as specified in sub-paragraph (1) (c) of this Regulation, no main transverse bulkhead bounding side tanks or double bottom tanks shall be assumed damage, unless—

(i)	the spacing of the adjacent transverse watertight is less, than the longitudinal extent of assumed damage specified in sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph; or

(ii)	there is a step or a recess in a transverse bulkhead of more than 3.05 meters in a transverse bulkhead of more than 3.05 metres in length, located within the extent of penetration of assumed damage. The step formed by the after peak bulkhead and after peak tank top shall not be regarded as a step for the purpose of this Regulation;

(/) if pipes, ducts or tunnels are situated within the assumed extent of damage arrangements shall be made so that progressive flooding cannot thereby extend to compartment other than those assume to be floodable for each case of damages.

(3)	Oil tankers shall be regarded as complying with the damage stability criteria if the following re-quirements are met—

(a)	the final waterline, taking into account sink age, heel and trim, shall be below the lower edge of any opening through which progressive flooding may take place. Such openings shall in-clude air pipes and those which are closed by means of watertight manhole covers and flush scuttles small watertight cargo tank hatch covers which maintain the high integrity of the deck, remotely watertight sliding doors, and side scuttles of the non-opening type;

(b)	in the final stage of flooding, the angel of heel due to unsymmetrical flooding shall exceed 25 degrees, provided that this angle may be increase up to 30 degrees if no deck edge immersion occurs;

(c)	the stability in the final stage of flooding shall be investigated and may be regarded as suffi-cient if the righting lever curve has at least a range of 20 degrees beyond the position of equilibrium in association with a maximum residual righting lever of at least than 0.0175 metres radians. Unprotected openings shall not be immersed within this range unless the space concerned is assumed to be flooded. Within this range, the immersion of any opening listed in sub-paragraph (a) of range, the immersion of any of the opening listed in sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph and other openings capable of being closed weather tight may be permitted;

(d)	the Administration shall be satisfied that the stability is sufficient during intermediate stages of flooding;

(e)	equalisation arrangements requiring mechanical aids as valves or cross levelling pipes, if fit-ted, shall not be considered for the purpose of reducing an angle of heel or attaining the minimum range of residual stability to meet the requirements of sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of 

this paragraph and sufficient residual stability shall be maintained during all stages where equalisation is issued. Spaces which are linked by ducts of a large cross sectional area may be considered to be common.

(4)	The requirements of paragraph (1) of this Regulation shall be confirmed by calculations which take into consideration the design characteristics of the ship, the arrangements configuration and contents of the damage compartments; and the distribution; specific gravities and the free surface effect of liquids. The calculations shall be based on the following—

(a)	account shall be taken of any empty or partially filled tank, the specific gravity of cargoes carried, a well as any outflow of liquids from damaged compartments;

(b)	the permeabilities assumed for space flooded as a result of damage shall be as follows—

Spaces

Permeabilities

Appropriate to stores 	 0.60

Occupied by accommodation 	 0.95

Occupied by machinery	 0.85

Voids	 0.95

Intended for consumable liquids	 0 to 0.95*

Intended for other liquids 	 0 to 0.95*;

(c)	the buoyancy of any superstructure directly above the side damage shall be disregarded. The unflooded parts of superstructures beyond the extent of damage, however, may be taken into consideration provided that they;

included in future updates to the work.)

(d)	the free surface shall be calculated at an angle of heel of 5 degrees for each individual com-partment. The Administration may require or allow the free surface corrections to be calcu-lated at an angle of heel greater than 5 degrees for partially filled tanks;

(e)	in calculation the effect of free surfaces of consumable liquids it shall be assumed that, for each type of liquid at least one transverse pair of a single center line into account shall be those where the effect of free surface is the greatest.

(5)	The Master of every new oil tanker and the person in charge of a non-self propelled oil tanker to which this Annex applies shall be supplied in an approved from with—

(a)	information relative to loading and distribution of cargo necessary to ensure compliance with the provisions of this Regulation; and

ANNEX II

Regulations for the Control of Pollution by Noxious Liquid Substances in Bulk

REGULATION 1

Definitions

For the purpose of this Annex—

(1)	'Chemical tanker' means a ship constructed or adapted primarily to carry a cargo of noxious liquid substances in bulk and includes an 'oil tanker' as defined in Annex I of the present convention when carrying a cargo or part cargo of noxious liquid substances in bulk.

(2)	'Clean ballast' means ballast carried in a tank which, since it was last used to carry a cargo containing a substance in category A, B, or C has been thoroughly cleaned and the residues resulting there from have been discharged and the tank emptied in accordance with the appropriate requirements of this Annex.

(3)	'Segregated ballast' means ballast water introduced into a tank permanently allocated to the carriage of ballast or to the carriage of ballast or cargoes other than oil or noxious liquid substances as variously defined in the Annexes of the present convention, and which is completely separated from the cargo and oil fuel system.

(4)	'Nearest land' is as defined in regulation 1 (9) of Annex I of the present Convention.

(5)	'Liquid substances' are those having a vapour pressure not exceeding 2.8kp/cm2 at a temperature of 37.8°C.

(6)	'Noxious liquid substance' means any substance referred to in Appendix to this Annex or provisionally assessed under the provisions of regulation 3 (4) as falling into category A, B, C, or D.

(7)	'Special area' means a sea area where for recognised technical reasons in relation to its oceanographic and ecological condition and to its peculiar transportation traffic the adoption of special mandatory methods for the prevention of sea pollution by noxious liquid substances is required. Special areas shall be—

(a)	the Baltic Sea Area; and

(b)	the Black Sea Area; and

(c)	the Antarctic Area.

REGULATION 2

Application

(1)	Unless expressly otherwise the provisions of this Annex apply to all ships carrying noxious liquid substances in bulk.

(2)	Where a cargo space of a chemical tanker, the appropriate requirements of Annex I of the present Convention shall also apply.

(3)	Regulation 13 of this Annex shall apply only to ships substances which are categorised for dis-charge control purposes in category A, B or C.

(4)	For ships constructed before 1 July, 1986, the provisions of regulation 5 of this Annex in respect of the requirement to discharge below the waterline and maximum concentration in the wake astern of the ship shall apply as from 1 January, 1988.

(5)	The Administration may allow any fitting, material, appliance or apparatus to be fitted in a ship as an alternative to that required by this Annex if such fitting, material, appliance or apparatus is at least as effective as that required by this Annex. This authority of the Administration shall not extend to the substitution of operational methods to effect the control of discharge of noxious liquid substances as equivalent to those design and construction features which are prescribed by Regulations in this Annex.

(6)	The Administration which allows a fitting material, appliance or apparatus as alternative to that required by this Annex, under paragraph (5) of this Regulation, shall communicate to the Organisation for circulation to the Parties to the Convention, particulars thereof; for their information and appropriate action, if any.

(7)	(a) Where an amendment to this Annex and the International Bulk Chemical and involves changes to the structure or equipment and fittings due to the upgrading of the requirements for the carriage of certain substances, the Administration may modify or delay for a specified period the application of such an amendment to ships constructed before application of such an amendment is considered unreasonable or impracticable. Such relaxation shall be determined with respect to each substance, having regard to the guidelines developed by the Organisation.*

(b)	The Administration allowing a relaxation of the application of an amendment under this para-graph shall submit to the Organisation a report giving details of the ship or ship(s) concerned, the cargoes carried, the trade.

REGULATION 3

Categorisation and Listing of Noxious Liquid Substances

(1)	For the purpose of the regulations of this Annex, noxious liquid substances shall be divided into four categories as follows—

(a)	Category A - noxious liquid substances which if discharged into the sea from tank cleaning or deballasting operations would present a major hazard to either marine resources or human health or cause serious harm to amenities or other legitimate use of the sea and therefore justify the application of stringent anti- pollution measures;

(b)	Category B - noxious liquid substances which if discharged into the sea from tank cleaning or deballasting operations would present a major hazard to either marine resources or human health or cause serious harm to amenities or other legitimate use of the sea and therefore justify the application of special anti-pollution measures;

The receipts or certificates must be kept on board the ship with the garbage record book for two years.

4.3	Amount of garbage

The amount of garbage on board should be estimated in m3, if possible separately according to cate-gory. The garbage record book contains many references to estimated amount of garbage. It is interpretation. Volume estimates will differ before and after processing. Some processing procedures may not allow for a usable estimate of volume, e.g. the continuous processing of food waste. Such factors should be taken into consideration when making and interpreting entries made in a record.
