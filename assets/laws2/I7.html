5.	Provisions where pioneer certificate operates retrospectively

Subject to the provisions of section 6 of this Act, where a pioneer certificate is to be operative from a retrospective date, then any act or thing which has been done or which has happened for the purposes of the principal Act since that date, but which would not have been done or happened if the pioneer certificate had been in force at that date, shall, whenever necessary for the purposes of this Act and the principal Act, be treated as not having been done or not having happened, and if the act consists of the payment of any tax by a company certified to be a pioneer company, that tax shall, as soon as may be after the expiration of three months from the production day of that company, be repaid to the company by the Board.

6.	Certifying the date of production day and the amount of qualifying capital expenditure, etc.

(1)	Not later than one month after the material date, a pioneer company shall make an application in writing to the Director to certify the date of its production day and shall propose a date to be so certified and give reason for proposing that date.

(2)	Not later than one month after the production day of a pioneer company has been finally deter-mined and certified under this section, or within such extended time as the Board may allow, a pioneer company shall make an application in writing to the Board or certify the amount of the qualifying capital expenditure incurred by the pioneer company prior to production day and the company shall supply full particulars of the capital expenditure so incurred.

(3)	In determining the amount of qualifying capital expenditure incurred by a pioneer company prior to its production day, any sum derived directly or indirectly by that company from any disposal (made before that day) of any asset on which qualifying capital expenditure has been incurred shall be taken into account for the purpose of reducing the amount of the qualifying capital expenditure; but where the disposal of such asset is by way of bargain not made at arm’s length or is to any person who is controlled by the pioneer company or who has control over the pioneer company, the asset shall be deemed to have been disposed of for an amount, which in the opinion of the Board, the asset would have fetched if sold in the open market at the date of the disposal, less the amount of any expenses which the company might reasonably be expected to incur if the asset were so sold.

(4)	After considering any application made under subsection (1) of this section, together with such further information as he may call for, the Director shall issue a certificate to the pioneer company cer-tifying the date of its production day.

(5)	After considering any application made under subsection (2) of this section, together with such further information as it may call for, the Board shall issue a certificate to the pioneer company certifying the amount of qualifying capital expenditure incurred by the company prior to production day.

(6)	The provisions of Parts IX and X of the principal Act (which relate to objections and appeals) and of any rules made thereunder, shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to any certificate issued by the Director or the Board under this section, as if such certificate were a notice of assessment given under the said provisions of the principal Act.

(7)	The Director shall notify the Minister and the Board of the date of the production day of the pioneer company when the same has been finally determined and certified by the Director.

(8)	When the amount of the qualifying capital expenditure incurred by the pioneer company prior to production day has been finally determined and certified by the Board, the Board shall notify the Minister of that amount.

(9)	On the receipt of the notifications mentioned in subsections (7) and (8) of this section, the Min-ister shall require the pioneer company to declare within a period not exceeding thirty days in what respects the proposals and estimates made in its application for a pioneer certificate, or any conditions contained in its pioneer certificate, have not been fulfilled.

(10)	Where a certificate issued by the Director under subsection (4) of this section certifies that the date of the production day of a pioneer company is more than one year later than the estimate thereof given in the company’s application for a pioneer certificate, the Minister shall report that fact to the President and the President shall cancel the pioneer certificate of that company unless he is satisfied that the delay is due to causes outside the control of the company or to other good and sufficient causes.

(11)	Where a certificate issued by the Board under subsection (5) of this section certifies that the pioneer company has on or before production day incurred qualifying capital expenditure of an amount which—

(a)	in the case of an indigenous-controlled company, is less than N50,000; or

(b)	in the case of any other company, is less than H 150,000,

the Commissioner shall report that fact to the President and the President shall cancel the pioneer cer-tificate of the company.

(3)	The effective date of cancellation of a pioneer certificate of a company shall be—

(a)	where the company has been in operation as a pioneer company for a period less than one year after the pioneer date, the pioneer date; and

(b)	where the company has been in operation as a pioneer company for a period of not less than one year after the pioneer date, the date of the last anniversary of the pioneer date,

and in this subsection, 'the pioneer date' means the date from which a pioneer certificate takes effect.

(4)	Where the pioneer certificate of a pioneer company is cancelled or the tax relief period of a company is restricted under subsection (2) of this section, the Minister shall give notice of the cancella-tion (specifying the effective date thereof) or of the restriction, to the pioneer company concerned.

(4)	For each accounting period, the Board shall issue to the pioneer company a statement showing the amount of income ascertained under subsection (1) of this section or loss computed in accordance with subsection (3) thereof; and the provisions of Parts IX and X of the principal Act (which relate to objections and appeals) and of any rules made thereunder shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the statement as if such statement were a notice of assessment given under the said provisions of the principal Act.

(3)	So much of the amount of any dividends so debited to the account as are received by a share-holder in the pioneer company shall, if the Board is satisfied with the entries in the account, be exempt from tax in the hands of that shareholder and shall for the purposes of the principal Act and the Personal Income Tax Act, be deemed to be paid out of profits on which tax is not paid or payable.

[Cap. P8.]
