General provisions as to protection of wages, contracts of employment and terms and conditions

of employment

Protection of wages

1.	Manner of payment

(1)	Subject to this section—

(a)	the wages of a worker shall in all contracts be made payable in legal tender and not otherwise; and

(b)	if in any contract the whole or any part of the wages of a worker is made payable in any other manner the contract shall be illegal, null and void.

(2)	An employer may provide food, a dwelling place or any other allowance or privilege as a part of a worker’s remuneration if the food, dwelling place, allowance or privilege is prescribed by law, by a collective agreement or by an arbitration award because it is customary or desirable in view of the nature of the industry or occupation in which the worker is engaged; but in no case shall an employer give to any worker any intoxicating liquor or noxious drug by way of remuneration.

(3)	Except where otherwise expressly permitted by this Act, wages payable in money shall be paid only in legal tender or, with the prior consent in writing of the worker concerned, by cheque or postal order and payment or purported payment in any other form shall be illegal, null and void.

2.	Agreement as to place and manner of spending wages illegal

No employer shall impose in any contract for the employment of any worker any terms as to the place at which, or the manner in which, or the person with whom any wages paid to the worker are to be expended; and every contract between an employer and a worker containing any such terms shall be illegal, null and void.

3.	Wages not to be paid on certain premises

Wages shall not be paid to a worker in premises used for the sale of intoxicating liquor or for the retail sale of goods, except in the case of a worker employed on the premises.

4.	Advances

(1)	No employer may make to a worker an advance of wages in excess of one month’s wages.

(2)	Where an advance in respect of wages has been paid to a worker the minimum period for the recovery of the advance by the employer shall be three months.

(3)	No advance in respect of wages shall be paid to a worker who is liable to repay any part of such an advance paid to him previously, except in cases of necessity as so approved by the employer.

(4)	No employer shall make any deduction by way of discount, interest or any similar charge on ac-count of any advance of wages paid to a worker in anticipation of the regular period of payment of the wages.

(5)	The State Authority may by order declare that this section shall not apply to any particular kind of advance paid to any particular class of worker or to all workers.

5.	Deductions (including deductions for overpayment of wages)

(1)	Except where it is expressly permitted by this Act or any other law, no employer shall make any deduction or make any agreement or contract with a worker for any deduction from the wages to be paid by the employer to the worker, or for any payment to the employer by the worker, for or in respect of any fines:

Provided that, with the prior consent in writing of an authorised labour officer, a reasonable de-duction may be made in respect of injury or loss caused to the employer by the wilful misconduct or neglect of the worker.

(2)	An employer may with the consent of a worker make deductions from the wages of the worker and pay to the appropriate person any contributions to provident or pension funds or other schemes agreed to by the worker and approved by the State Authority.

(3)	Upon the registration and recognition of any of the trade unions specified in Part A of Schedule 3 to the Trade Unions Act, the employer shall—

[No. 17 of 1986 and Cap. T14.]

(a) make deductions from the wages of all workers eligible to be members of the union for the purpose of paying contributions to the trade union so recognised; and

(b)	pay any sum so deducted to the union,

but a worker may contract out of the system, in writing, and where he has done so, no deductions shall be made from his wages in respect of contributions mentioned in paragraph (a) of this section.

(4)	No deductions shall be made from the wages and salaries of persons who are eligible members of any of the trade unions specified in Part B of the Third Schedule of the Trade Unions Act except if the person concerned has accepted, in writing, to make voluntary contributions to the trade union. 

CARLI

(5)	Deductions may be made from the wages of a worker in respect of overpayment of wages, but only in respect of any such overpayment made during the three months immediately preceding the month in which the overpayment was discovered.

[Cap. T14.]

(6)	An employer shall, when making a payment to a trade union under paragraph (b) of subsection

(3)	of this section, include with such payment a list of the employees from whom deductions were made pursuant to paragraph (c) of the said subsection.

(7)	Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Act, the total amount of deductions that may be made from the wages of a worker in any one month shall not exceed one third of the wages of the worker for that month.

6.	Authority of employer to open shop

(1)	The Minister may, after consultation with the State Authority, give approval to an employer to establish a shop for the sale of provisions to his workers, but no worker shall be compelled by any con-tract or agreement, written or oral, to purchase provisions at any shop so established.

(2)	No employer shall in any place of employment establish a shop for the sale of provisions to his workers (or permit such a shop to be established or kept) otherwise than in accordance with subsection (1) of this section.

Contracts of employment

7.	Written particulars of terms of employment

(1)	Not later than three months after the beginning of a worker’s period of employment with an employer, the employer shall give to the worker a written statement specifying—

(b)	the name and address of the worker and the place and date of his engagement;

(c)	the nature of the employment;

(2)	If after the date to which the said statement relates there is a change in the terms to be included or referred to in the statement the employer—

(a)	shall, not more than one month after the change, inform the worker of the nature of the change by a written statement; and

(b)	if he does not leave a copy of the statement with the worker, shall preserve the statement and ensure that the worker has reasonable opportunities of reading it in the course of his em-ployment, or that it is made reasonably accessible to the worker in some other way. 

(3)	A statement under subsection (1) or (2) of this section may, for all or any of the particulars to be given by the statement, refer the worker to some other document which the worker has reasonable op-portunities of reading in the course of his employment or which is made reasonably accessible to the worker in some other way.

(4)	If the employer, in referring in the said statement to any such document, indicates to the worker that future changes in the terms particularised in the document will be entered in the document (or re-corded by some other means for the information of persons referred to in the document), the employer need not under subsection (2) of this section inform the worker of any such change which is duly entered or recorded not more than one month after the change is made.

(5)	If, not more than six months after the termination of a worker’s period of employment, a further period of employment is begun with the same employer and the terms of employment are the same, no statement need be given under subsection (1) of this section in respect of the second period of employ-ment, so however that this subsection shall be without prejudice to the operation of subsection (2) of this section if there is a change in the terms of employment.

(6)	The provisions of this section in respect of written statements shall not apply if—

(a)	a worker has a written contract of employment which covers each of the particulars mentioned in subsection (1) of this section; and

(b)	he has a copy of that written contract.

8.	Medical examination

(1)	Every worker who enters into a contract shall be medically examined by a registered medical practitioner at the expense of the employer.

(2)	The State Authority may by order exempt from the requirement of medical examination workers entering into contracts for—

(b)	employment in the vicinity of the workers’ homes—

(i)	in agricultural work; or

(ii)	in non-agricultural work which the State Authority is satisfied is not of a dangerous character or likely to be injurious to the health of the workers.

9.	Contracts: general

(1)	No contract shall be deemed to be binding on the family or dependants of a worker unless it contains an express provision to that effect.

(2)	An employer shall be responsible for the performance of any contract made by any person acting on his behalf.

(3)	Except in the case of a contract of apprenticeship, no person under the age of sixteen years shall be capable of entering into a contract of employment under this Act.

(b)	cause the dismissal of, or otherwise prejudice, a worker—

(i)	by reason of trade union membership; or

(ii)	because of trade union activities outside working hours or, with the consent of the employer, within working hours; or

(iii)	by reason of the fact that he has lost or been deprived of membership of a trade union or has refused or been unable to become, or for any other reason is not, a member of a trade union.

(7)	A contract shall be terminated—

(a)	by the expiry of the period for which it was made; or

(b)	by the	death of the worker before the expiry of that period; or

(c)	by notice in accordance with section 11 of this Act or in any other way in which a contract is legally terminable or held to be terminated.

(8)	The termination of a contract by the death of a worker shall be without prejudice to the legal claims of his personal representatives or dependants.

10.	Transfer to other employment

(1)	The transfer of any contract from one employer to another shall be subject to the consent of the worker and the endorsement of the transfer upon the contract by an authorised labour officer.

(2)	Before endorsing the transfer upon the contract, the officer in question—

(a)	shall ascertain that the worker has freely consented to the transfer and that his consent has not been obtained by coercion or undue influence or as a result of misrepresentation or mistake; and

(b)	if by the transfer the worker will—

(i)	change his form of employment from one which is the subject of an exemption order made under section 8 (2) of this Act; or

(ii)	be subject to such a change of conditions as in the officer’s opinion renders such a course advisable,

may require the worker to be medically examined or re-examined, as the case may be.

11.	Termination of contracts by notice

(1)	Either party to a contract of employment may terminate the contract on the expiration of notice given by him to the other party of his intention to do so.

(2)	The notice to be given for the purposes of subsection (1) of this section shall be—

(b)	one week, where the contract had continued for more than three months but less than two years;

(c)	two weeks, where the contract has continued for a period of two years but less than five years; and

(d)	one month, where the contract had continued for five years or more.

(3)	Any notice for a period of one week or more shall be in writing.

(4)	The periods of notice specified in subsection (2) of this section exclude the day on which notice is given.

(5)	Nothing in this section affects any right of either party to a contract to treat the contract as ter-minable without notice by reason of such conduct by the other party as would have enabled him so to treat it before the making of this Act.

(6)	Nothing in this section shall prevent either party to a contract from waiving his right to notice on any occasion, or from accepting a payment in lieu of notice.

(7)	All wages payable in money shall be paid on or before the expiry of any period of notice.

(8)	If an employer gives notice to terminate the contract of employment of a worker who has been continuously employed for three months or more, the employer shall not be liable under this section to make any payment in respect of a period during which the worker is absent from work with the leave of the employer granted at the request of the worker.

(9)	In the calculation of a payment in lieu of notice, only that part of the wages which a worker re-ceives in money, exclusive of overtime and other allowances, shall be taken into account.

12.	Common employment not a defence

(1)	It shall not be a defence to an employer who is sued in respect of personal injuries caused by the negligence of a person employed by him, that that person was, at the time the injuries were caused, in common employment with the person injured.

(2)	Any provisions contained in a contract of service or apprenticeship, or in an agreement collateral thereto (including a contract or agreement entered into before the commencement of this section) shall be void in so far as it would have the effect of excluding or limiting any liability of the employer in respect of personal injuries caused to the person employed or apprenticed by the negligence of persons in common employment with him.

(3)	For the purposes of this section, the expression 'personal injuries' includes any disease and any impairment of a person’s physical or mental condition arising out of his employment, and 'injury' and cognate expressions shall be construed accordingly.

Terms and conditions of employment

13.	Hours of work and overtime

(1)	Normal hours of work in any undertaking shall be those fixed—

(a)	by mutual agreement; or

(b)	by collective bargaining within the organisation or industry concerned; or

(c)	by an industrial wages board (established by or under an enactment providing for the estab-lishment of such boards) where there is no machinery for collective bargaining.

(2)	Hours which a worker is required to work in excess of the normal hours fixed under subsection

(1)	of this section shall constitute overtime.

(3)	Where a worker is at work for six hours or more a day, his work shall be interrupted (to the extent which is necessary, having regard to its character and duration and to working conditions in general) by allowing one or more suitably spaced rest-intervals of not less than one hour on the aggregate:

Provided that—

(a)	exceptions may be made to the rule in this subsection where unforeseen circumstances render them necessary; and

(b)	where it is found unavoidable in view of the nature of the work and the working conditions in general, time-off for a meal at the worksite or in the immediate vicinity may be substituted for the rest-interval.

(4)	In subsection (3) of this section, 'rest-interval' means an interruption of work of which the length is fixed beforehand and during which the worker is free to dispose of his time and is not required to remain at the place of work.

(5)	Where, by reason of its connection with a mechanical process or as a result of other circum-stances, the work involves continuous strain or is particularly trying in other ways, the worker shall be allowed the requisite number of suitably adjusted and spaced breaks in the work.

(6)	In subsection (5) of this section, 'break in the work' means a short intermission in the work fixed beforehand which is ordered with a view to allowing the worker to detach himself from his work and which is not to be counted as a rest-interval or time-off under subsection (3) of this section.

(7)	In every period of seven days a worker shall be entitled to one day of rest which shall not be less than 24 consecutive hours; if any reduction takes place in the weekly rest-period—

(a)	corresponding time-off from work shall be allowed as soon as possible (and in any case not later than fourteen days thereafter); or

(b)	wages at overtime rates shall be paid in lieu thereof.

14.	Provision of transport

(1)	Where a worker is required to travel sixteen kilometres or more from his normal place of work to another worksite he shall be entitled to free transport or an allowance in lieu thereof.

(2)	Where the employer provides a vehicle or vessel for the purposes of subsection (1) of this sec-tion, he shall ensure that the vehicle or vessel is suitable, is in good sanitary condition and is not over-crowded.

15.	Periodicity of payment of wages

Wages shall become due and payable at the end of each period for which the contract is expressed to subsist, that is to say, daily, weekly or at such other period as may be agreed upon:

Provided that, where the period is more than one month, the wages shall become due and payable at intervals not exceeding one month.

16.	Sick leave

Subject to the Workmen’s Compensation Act, a worker shall be entitled to be paid wages up to twelve working days in any one calendar year during absence from work caused by temporary illness certified by a registered medical practitioner:

Provided that this section shall not apply unless—

(a)	the contract remains in existence during the period of absence and the worker is ready and willing to perform his part of the contract save for the incapacity produced by the illness; and

(b)	the worker, if so requested by the employer, consents to be examined by a qualified medical practitioner nominated by the employer.

[Cap. W6.]

17.	Duty of employer to provide work

(1)	Except where a collective agreement provides otherwise, every employer shall, unless a worker has broken his contract, provide work suitable to the worker’s capacity on every day (except rest days and public holidays) on which the worker presents himself and is fit for work; and, if the employer fails to provide work as aforesaid, he shall pay to the worker in respect of each day on which he has so failed wages at the same rate as would be payable if the worker had performed a day’s work: 

CARLI

Provided that—

(a) where, owing to a temporary emergency or other circumstances beyond the employer’s control (the period of which shall not exceed one week or such longer period as an authorised labour officer may allow in any particular case), the employer is unable to provide work, the worker shall be entitled to those wages only on the first day of the period in question; and

(b)	this subsection shall not apply where the worker is suspended from work as a punishment for a breach of discipline or any other offence.

(2)	Where a worker is employed in any agricultural undertaking on a plantation on a contract of service under which he earns wages calculated by reference to the number of days’ work performed in each month of his service, the employer shall provide the worker with work suitable to his capacity on not less than 24 days in each month during the whole of which he is so employed; and, if the employer fails to provide work as aforesaid on any of those twenty-four days on which the worker presents himself and is fit for work, he shall pay to the worker in respect of each such day wages at the same rates as would be payable if the worker had performed a day’s work:

Provided that, in computing twenty-four days for the purposes of this subsection, account shall not be taken of more than six days in any one week.

(3)	Any dispute between an employer and a worker as to the worker’s fitness for work under sub-section (1) or (2) of this section may be referred to an authorised labour officer, who may take such medical or other advice as he thinks appropriate and whose decision shall be final.

18.	Annual holidays with pay

(1)	Every worker shall be entitled after twelve months’ continuous service to a holiday with full pay of—

(a)	at least six working days; or

(b)	in the case of a person under the age of sixteen years (including an apprentice), at least twelve working days.

(2)	The holiday mentioned in subsection (1) of this section may be deferred by agreement between the employer and the worker:

Provided that the holiday-earning period shall not thereby be increased beyond twenty-four months’ continuous service.

(3)	It shall be unlawful for an employer to pay wages in lieu of the holiday mentioned in subsection (1) of this section to a worker whose contract has not terminated.

(4)	A person who ceases to be employed after having completed—

(a)	less than twelve but not less than six months in the continuous employment of an employer; or

(b)	not less than six months in the continuous employment of an employer since he last qualified for a holiday under subsection (1) of this section,

shall be paid with respect to that period of employment an amount bearing the same proportion to full pay for one week at his normal rate as that period bears to twelve months.

19.	Calculation of leave pay and sickness benefits

In the calculation of leave pay and sickness benefits only that part of his wages which a worker re-ceives in money (excluding overtime and other allowances) shall be taken into account. 

20.	Redundancy

(1)	In the event of redundancy—

(a)	the employer shall inform the trade union or workers’ representative concerned of the reasons for and the extent of the anticipated redundancy;

(b)	the principle of 'last in, first out' shall be adopted in the discharge of the particular category of workers affected, subject to all factors of relative merit, including skill, ability and reliability; and

(c)	the employer shall use his best endeavours to negotiate redundancy payments to any discharged workers who are not protected by regulations made under subsection (2) of this section.

(2)	The Minister may make regulations providing, generally or in particular cases, for the compulsory payment of redundancy allowances on the termination of a worker’s employment because of his redundancy.

(3)	In this section, 'redundancy' means an involuntary and permanent loss of employment caused by an excess of manpower.

General

(1)	Any employer who—

(a)	enters into any agreement or contract or gives any remuneration for employment contrary to this Part or declared by this Part to be illegal or unlawful; or

shall be guilty of an offence and liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding N800 or, for a second or subsequent offence, to a fine not exceeding H1,500.

(2)	Where an employer is charged with an offence under subsection (1) of this section—

(a)	he shall be entitled, upon information duly laid by him, to have any other person whom he charges as the actual offender brought before the court at the time appointed for hearing the charge; and

(b)	if, after the commission of the offence has been proved, the employer proves to the satisfaction of the court that he has used due diligence to enforce this Part and that the other person has committed the offence without the employer’s knowledge, consent or connivance, the other person shall be convicted of the offence and the employer shall be exempted from any liability.

(3)	Where it is made to appear to the satisfaction of the Minister at the time of the discovery of an apparent offence under subsection (1) of this section—

(a)	that the employer in question has used due diligence to enforce this Part;

(b)	by what person the offence had been committed; and

(c)	that the offence has been committed without the knowledge, connivance or consent of the employer,

pensary accommodation and treatment and their payment by the employer, provided always that such employer shall not be liable for the payment of such fees to the hospital authority in excess of a period of six weeks from the commencement of such treatment or a period equal to the period during which the labourer receiving treatment has been employed by such employer, whichever period may be the lesser, or, in the alternative;

(ii) for an annual capitation fee to be charged by the hospital authority in place of the fees referred to in paragraph (b) (i) of this Regulation;

(c)	for the payment by the employer to the hospital authority in respect of hospital diet supplied by such authority to in-patient labourers at a rate not less than the current rate for hospital pauper diets for a period of six weeks from the commencement of incapacity or a period equal to the period during which the labourer incapacitated as aforesaid has been employed by such employer, whichever period may be the lesser:

Provided that where an annual capitation fee is charged under the provisions of sub-paragraph (ii) of paragraph (b) of this Regulation, such capitation fee shall include payments by an employer in respect of hospital diet supplied to in-patient labourers and accordingly the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply; and

(d)	for the provision of suitable transport for sick and injured labourers from the place of their work or their homes, as the case may be, to the hospital or appropriate treatment centre.

23.	Every employer shall be responsible for the care and supervision, and for the proper feeding to the satisfaction of the medical officer, of his sick and injured labourers until such time as they are formally received and accepted as in-patients by a hospital authority.

[No. 23 of 1933.]

24.	Notwithstanding the provisions of regulation 22 of these Regulations, any employer may, if he so desires, and shall, if the State Director of Medical Services considers that such provision is necessary, provide one or more hospitals and dispensaries for the accommodation and treatment of his sick and injured labourers:

Provided always that—

(a)	such provision shall be in accordance with and conform to the requirements of hospitals in labour health areas; and

[No. 36 of 1933, Order 47 of 1951 and L.N. 131 of 1954.]

(b)	such provision, in addition to the approval of the State Director of Medical Services in so far as the same is required, shall, if the place where the labourers work is situate in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, require the approval of the Minister, or if the place is situate in any State, that of the State Commissioner charged with responsibility for Labour.

25.	Regulations 20,21,22,23 and 24 of these Regulations shall not apply in a labour health area.

[No. 36 of 1933.]

26.	Save where agreement is made to the contrary, no deduction shall be made from the wages of a labourer for housing, fuel, medicine or medical attendance provided or paid for by the employer.

27.	(1) When the employer has agreed to supply the labourer with food, the food supplied shall not be less than the following scale—

(a)	5.44 kilograms of grain (including rice) per week; and 

(b)	0.907 kilograms of beans or groundnuts per week; and

(c)	170 grams of salt (or 56.7 grams of salt and 0.907 kilograms of green food per week), exclusive of chaff, stalk or shell that may be given together with the grain, beans or groundnut kernels; also other rations may be supplied; provided that the diet shall not be of less nutritive value than the diet prescribed in the above scale.

[No. 36 of 1933.]

(2)	The rations supplied shall, as far as possible, be in accordance with the food to which the labourer is accustomed, and the employer shall comply with all reasonable directions of a medical officer with regard to the quantity and kind of ration to be supplied.

28.	(1) No labourer shall be required to work for more than ten hours a day, and every labourer shall be allowed to break off work for two hours during the day, and also adequate time to obtain fuel and prepare his food in the evening.

(2)	This Regulation does not apply to piece-workers, labourers employed on coaling a vessel, or night watchmen.

29.	On the expiration of the contract of service, or when the labourer is unable by reason of illness to complete his service, the employer shall—

(a)	if the labourer has been brought to the place of employment by ship or railway at the cost of the employer, provide the labourer with a return passage or fare to the place of engagement; or

(b)	if otherwise brought by the employer or his agent to the place of employment, provide him with subsistence at the rate of five kobo per diem, for the time during which the labourer would take to reach the place from which he has been brought, travelling eighteen miles per diem:

Provided that a labourer who is unable to complete his service by reason of illness shall not be re-turned to the place from which he has been brought until a medical officer has certified that he is fit to travel.

30.	(1) An employer shall report without delay to the nearest magistrate any accident involving the death of or injury to any labourer who is not a workman within the meaning of the Workmen’s Compensation Act nor a person to whom the provisions of any other Act respecting compensation for such death or injury apply.

[No. 21 of 1942 and Cap. W6.]

(2)	Upon receipt of such report the magistrate shall hold an inquiry and if the injury is one resulting in death, or which incapacitates such labourer for a period of at least one week from earning full wages at the work at which he was engaged, or which results in total or partial incapacity from earning his living, the magistrate shall award to such labourer or to his dependants or any one or more of such dependants such sum as he may deem just.

(3)	Where it is proved that the injury to such labourer is attributable to his serious and wilful mis-conduct, compensation shall be disallowed:

Provided that where the injury results in death or serious and permanent incapacity the magistrate, on a consideration of all the circumstances, may award such compensation as he may deem just.

(4)	Where a magistrate makes an award under the provisions of this Regulation, he may order the amount so awarded to be paid in one lump sum or by instalments payable at such periods as he may think fit; or may order, in the sole discretion of any person named in such order, that the sum awarded be expended for the benefit of such labourer or of such dependants of such labourer as the magistrate may decide.

(5)	Where a magistrate makes an award under the provisions of this Regulation, he may order, in addition to any such award, that the employer shall pay all reasonable medical and hospital expenses incurred by a labourer in treatment of the injury.

(6)	Where a sum is due upon any award made under this Regulation, the labourer to whom such sum is due or the dependant entitled thereto may recover such sum by process of law as if the award under which such sum is due were a judgment of the court of the magistrate who made the award.

(7)	Nothing in this Regulation contained shall affect the civil liability of the employer under any other law unless compensation is paid under this Regulation.

31.	(1) Any person aggrieved by the decision of a magistrate holding an inquiry under the provisions of regulation 30 of these Regulations may appeal to a Judge of the High Court within whose area of jurisdiction the accident occurred by giving notice of appeal to the appropriate court within fourteen days of the date of such decision.

[No. 21 of 1942 and L.N. 1 of 1955.]

(2) The decision of such Judge shall be final.

[21 of 1942.]

32.	For the purposes of regulations 30 and 31 of these Regulations, 'partial incapacity”, 'total inca-pacity' and 'dependants' shall have the same meaning as in the Workmen’s Compensation Act as from time to time amended.

[Cap. W6 and No. 21 of 1942.]

33.	Any administrative officer, medical officer, sanitary superintendent or inspector of labour may for the purposes of these Regulations at any time enter upon any land or into any building where any labourer is employed or housed, and may put questions concerning such labourers to their employer or to any person who may be in charge of them, or to the labourers themselves, and the employer or such person, or any such labourer, shall answer any such questions truly to the best of his ability.

(2)	For the purpose of such registration a dock employer shall, when requested by the Permanent Secretary to do so, forward to the port labour officer a list of dock workers employed by him showing, separately, the names of the workers who are to be placed on the preference list and of those to be placed on the non-preference list.

(3)	The number of such registered dock workers, two thirds of which shall be on the preference list and one third on the non-preference list, shall be determined by the Permanent Secretary.

(4)	A registered employer shall report in writing to the port labour officer for final decision any disciplinary action involving the dismissal or suspension of a dock worker registered with the employer and the report shall include the reasons for the dismissal or suspension.

(5)	The port labour officer’s decision on such report shall include a ruling on whether or not the name of a dismissed dock worker shall be removed from the register.

6.	Registration of employment

(1)	No person other than a registered employer shall be engaged in dock work or employ any worker on dock work and, save as hereinafter provided, a registered employer shall not engage for employment or employ a worker on dock work unless that worker is a registered dock worker.

(2)	Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph of this rule, where the port labour officer is satisfied that dock work is urgently required to be done and it is not reasonably practicable to obtain a registered dock worker for that work, he may in respect of that work either allocate to a registered employer a person who is not a registered dock worker or permit a registered employer himself to engage such a person and a dock worker employed under this paragraph shall be employed on daily basis. 

CARLI

(3)	Notwithstanding any other provision contained in these Rules a supervisor, headman or person for the time being in charge of a gang of dock workers shall be held liable for any contravention of these rules where the employer satisfactorily shows that the said contravention came about by the disregard of the employer’s instruction and that the employer had done all within his power to prevent such contravention.
