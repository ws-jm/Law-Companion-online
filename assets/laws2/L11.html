(b)	order that until the taxation is completed no action to recover the charges mentioned in the bill shall be begun and any such action already begun shall be stayed,

and an order under the subsection may be made on such terms (other than terms as to the costs of the taxation) as the court may determine.

(3)	No order shall be made under subsection (2) of this section—

(a)	in any case, after the period of twelve months from the date on which the bill in question was paid;

(b)	except in a case where the court determines that there are special reasons for making such an order, if twelve months have expired since the date of the delivery of the bill or if judgment has been given in an action to recover the charges in question,

and an order made by virtue of paragraph (b) of this subsection may contain terms as to the costs of the taxation. 

18.	Taxation

(1)	The taxation of a bill of charges shall be in accordance with the provisions of any order in force under section 15 of this Act, and where no such order is in force or any item falling to be taxed is not dealt with by the order, the charges to be allowed on taxation of the item shall not exceed such as are reasonable having regard to the skill, labour and responsibility involved and to all the circumstances of the case.

(2)	If, at the time and place appointed in pursuance of rules of court for the taxation of a bill, one of the parties appears and any other party does not, the taxing officer shall proceed to tax the bill unless for special reasons he determines to adjourn or further adjourn the taxation so as to afford an absent party an opportunity to be present, and where he does so determine he may also determine by whom any costs of the adjournment or further adjournment shall be payable.

(3)	Where on the taxation of a bill it appears to the taxing officer that there are circumstances of the case which make it appropriate to refer the taxation to the court, he shall so refer it, and the court may either—

(b)	refer the taxation back to the taxing officer with its direction in the matter.

(6)	The certificate of the taxing officer in respect of a bill of charges, or where the certificate is varied on appeal, the certificate as so varied, shall be conclusive as to the amount of the charges payable in respect of the bill, but nothing in this subsection shall be construed as relieving a legal practitioner of any obligation to prove that a client is liable to pay a bill of charges, or as precluding a client from disproving that he is so liable.

(7)	Subject to the provisions of any order made by virtue of section 17 (3) of this Act, if the amount stated in a certificate under this section relating to a bill of costs, or in such a certificate as varied on appeal, is less than the amount of the bill before taxation and the difference is equal to one sixth or more of the amount of the bill before taxation, the costs of the taxation shall be payable by the legal practitioner, and in any other case those costs shall be payable by the client.

GUIDELINES FOR THE CONFERMENT OF THE RANK OF

SENIOR ADVOCATE OF NIGERIA

Notice is hereby given that the Legal Practitioners Privileges Committee, established under Section 5 (3) of the Legal Practitioners Act, Cap, Lll, will henceforth and for the time being observe the principles and follow the procedure set out in the Part I of these guidelines in the selection of qualified candidates for the conferment of the rank of Senior Advocate of Nigeria. The Committee shall select the candidates on the basis of eligibility and competence criteria set out in Part II of these Guidelines.

[S.I. 27 of 2007.]

[Date of commencement: 25th January, 2007]

PARTI

Principles and Procedure for the Appointment of

Senior Advocates of Nigeria

1.	Objectives

The Award of the rank of the Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) is a privilege. It is awarded as a mark of excellence to members of the legal profession who are in full time legal practice, have distinguished themselves as advocates and have made significant contribution to the development of the legal profession in Nigeria.

2.	Principles

The award of the rank of Senior Advocate of Nigeria shall be based on the following principles:

(1) Merit.—The award of the rank of Senior Advocate of Nigeria is expected to be an independent indication of excellence in the legal profession. It is to provide a public identification of advo-cates whose standing and achievement would justify an expectation on the part of clients, the judiciary and the public that they can provide outstanding services as advocates and advisers in the overall best interest of good administration of justice.

The fulfilment of the stipulated criteria for eligibility and for competence as defined and pub-lished from time to time by the LPPC will be the primary basis of the appointment.

(2)	Equal Opportunities.—All applicants will be treated equally and the award will be based on merit. Applications will be considered without regard to ethnic origin, pedigree, gender, physical disability, marital status, age, religious belief, political views or affiliations.

(3)	Gender and Geographical Spread.—Every effort shall be made to ensure that appointments in every year of candidates who have met the criteria reflect a national character by achieving as much geographical spread and gender representation as is possible.

(4)	Self Financing.—The award of the rank of Senior Advocate of Nigeria shall be a self financing process. This is to ensure that the rigorous nature of the screening process is maintained. To this end, appropriate fees as determined from time to time by the Legal Practitioner's Privileges Committee shall be charged as processing fee. The fee shall be based on reasonable estimates on actual cost of administering the process and adequate to ensure a proper and efficient conduct of the selection exercise.

(5)	Award to Academics.—The award of rank of Senior Advocate of Nigeria shall continue to be made primarily to legal practitioners who have distinguished themselves as advocates. The LPPC- may however, in exceptional cases, approve the award of rank of a Senior Advocate of Nigeria to a member of the legal profession who has distinguished himself as an academic by making substantial contributions to the practice of law, through teaching and research and pub-lications that have become major source of reference by legal practitioners, Judges, law teachers and law students.

(6)	Role of the Legal Practitioners Privileges Committee.—The LPPC’s role in the appointment will be strengthened to ensure that the process is fully in the hands and controlled by the committee. The primary mode of consultation will be by way of confidential reference from Judges of Superior Courts, the Nigerian Bar Association and other practitioners. The LPPC shall continue to consult Judges of Superior Court, including the Justices of the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal as well as Chief Judges, not as primary means of selection of candidates but more as final check in the selection procedure.

(7)	Confidentiality.—The process of the selection for the Rank of Senior Advocates of Nigeria shall be conducted in strict confidence. Information provided by applicants, views and opinions given or expressed to the committee by all persons consulted shall be treated in confidence.

(8)	Face to Face Interview.—The process of selection will be greatly enhanced if it included face to face interview with prospective candidates. This will enable the LPPC to meet the candidates, verify some of the information provided in the application forms and provide a further opportunity to ascertaining the candidate’s competence. In order to facilitate the process and make it less burdensome, the face to face interview should be at the final selection process after the number of the candidates has been reduced to a final shortlist not exceeding three times the number of persons to be appointed in any given year.

(9)	 Number of Persons Appointed to be Limited Feedback.—The LPPC may from time to time fix the number of persons to be appointed each year having regard to the need to maintain highest standards of excellence and the prestige of the rank. The number for the time being is limited to fifteen each year. 

(10)	A feedback process will be introduced. This will enable an unsuccessful candidate to request and obtain written feed back explaining why his application was unsuccessful and pointing out areas the candidate will be required to improve his/her competence.

(11)	Complaints Procedure.—A complaints procedure would be instituted to provide avenue for candidates to lodge complaints where they perceive that they had been treated unfairly. The procedure will allow the complaints to be treated promptly and feedback given to the candidate.

A successful outcome of a complaint will not be an automatic award of the rank but will allow the LPPC to take remedial action to avert future occurrence. The LPPC may on a case by case basis determine what other measures will be taken in respect of a complaint that had been successfully lodged in relation to future consideration of the candidate whose complaint had been upheld.

Method of Appointment

3.	Announcement
