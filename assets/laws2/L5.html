18.	Acceptance of rent not to operate as a waiver of forfeiture

Subject to the provisions of sections 20 and 21 of this Act, the acceptance by or on behalf of the Governor of any rent shall not operate as a waiver by the Governor of any forfeiture accruing by reason of the breach of any covenant or condition, express or implied, in any certificate of occupancy granted under this Act.

19.	Penal rent

(1)	When in any certificate of occupancy the holder has covenanted to develop or effect improve-ments on the land, the subject of the certificate of occupancy, and has committed a breach of such covenant the Governor may—

(a) at the time of such breach or at any time thereafter, so long as the breach remains unremedied, fix a penal rent which shall be payable for twelve months from the date of such breach; and

(c)	on the expiration of twelve months from the date of such breach and on the expiration of every subsequent twelve months so long as the breach continues, revise the penal rent to be paid.

(2)	Such penal rent or any revision thereof shall be in addition to the rent reserved by the certificate of occupancy and shall be recoverable as rent:

Provided that the first penal rent fixed shall not exceed the rent so reserved and any revised penal rent shall not exceed double the penal rent payable in respect of the twelve months preceding the date of revision.

(3)	If the Governor fixes or revises a penal rent, he shall cause a notice in writing to be sent to the holder informing him of the amount thereof and the rent so fixed or revised shall commence to be payable one calendar month from the date of the receipt of such notice.

(4)	If the breach for which a penal rent has been imposed is remedied before the expiration of the period for which such rent has been paid, the Governor may in his discretion refund such portion of the penal rent paid for such period as he may think fit.

(5)	The fact that a penal rent or a revised penal rent has been imposed shall not preclude the Gover-nor, in lieu of fixing a subsequent penal rent, from revoking the statutory right of occupancy:

Provided that the statutory right of occupancy shall not be revoked during the period for which a penal rent has been paid.

20.	Additional penal rent for unlawful alienation

(1)	If there has been any breach of any of the provisions of section 22 or 23 of this Act, the Governor may in lieu of revoking the statutory right of occupancy concerned, demand that the holder shall pay an additional and penal rent for and in respect of each day during which the land the subject of the statutory right of occupancy or any portion thereof or any buildings or other works erected thereon shall be or remain in the possession, control or occupation of any person whomsoever other than the holder.

(2)	Such additional and penal rent shall be payable upon demand and shall be recoverable as rent.

(3)	The acceptance by or on behalf of the Governor of any such additional and penal rent shall not operate as a waiver by the Governor of any breach of section 22 or 23 of this Act which may continue after the date up to and in respect of which such additional and penal rent has been paid or is due and owing and the Governor shall accordingly be entitled to exercise in respect of any such continuing breach all or any of the powers conferred upon him by this Act.

(b)	in the case of a statutory right of occupancy (unless any non-customary law or other custom-ary law applies) be regulated by the customary law of the deceased occupier at the time of his death relating to the distribution of property of like nature to a right of occupancy:

Provided that—

(c)	no customary law prohibiting, restricting or regulating the devolution on death to any par-ticular class of persons or the right to occupy any land shall operate to deprive any person of any beneficial interest in such land (other than the right to occupy the same) or in the proceeds of sale thereof to which he may be entitled under the rules of inheritance of any other customary law;

(d)	a statutory right of occupancy shall not be divided into two or more parts on devolution by the death of the occupier, except with the consent of the Governor.

25.	Effect of deed or will where non-customary law applies

In the case of the devolution or transfer of rights to which any non-customary law applies, no deed or will shall operate to create any proprietary right over land except that of a plain transfer of the whole of the rights of occupation over the whole of the land.

(7)	The title of the holder of a right of occupancy shall be extinguished on receipt by him of a notice given under subsection (6) of this section or on such later date as may be stated in the notice.

29.	Compensation payable on revocation of right of occupancy by Governor in certain cases

(1)	If a right of occupancy is revoked for the cause set out in section 28 (2) (b) of this Act or in sub-section (3) (a) or (c) of the same section, the holder and the occupier shall be entitled to compensation for the value at the date of revocation of their un-exhausted improvements.

(2)	If a right of occupancy is revoked for the cause set out in section 28 (2) (c) of this Act or in sub-section (3) (b) of the same section the holder and the occupier shall be entitled to compensation under the appropriate provisions of the Minerals and Mining Act or the Petroleum Act or any legislation replacing the same.

[Cap. M12 and Cap. P10.]

(3)	If the holder or the occupier entitled to compensation under this section is a community the Governor may direct that any compensation payable to it shall be paid—

(a)	to the community; or

(b)	to the chief or leader of the community to be disposed of by him for the benefit of the com-munity in accordance with the applicable customary law; or

(c)	into some fund specified by the Governor for the purpose of being utilised or applied for the benefit of the community.

(a)	the land, for an amount equal to the rent, if any, paid by the occupier during the year in which the right of occupancy was revoked;

(b)	buildings, installation or improvements thereon, for the amount of the replacement cost of the building, installation or improvement, that is to say, such cost as may be assessed on the basis of the prescribed method of assessment as determined by the appropriate officer less any depreciation, together with interest at the bank rate for delayed payment of compensation and in respect of any improvement in the nature of reclamation works, being such cost thereof as may be substantiated by documentary evidence and proof to the satisfaction of the appropriate officer;

(c)	crops on land apart from any building, installation or improvement thereon, for an amount equal to the value as prescribed and determined by the appropriate officer.

(5)	Where the land in respect of which a right of occupancy has been revoked forms part of a larger area, the compensation payable shall be computed as in subsection (4) (a) of this section less a propor-tionate amount calculated in relation to that part of the area not affected by the revocation, but of which the portion revoked forms a part and any interest payable shall be assessed and computed in the like manner.

(6)	Where there is any building, installation or improvement or crops on the land to which subsection (5) of this section applies, then compensation shall be computed as specified hereunder, that is as respects—

[No. 33 of 1976.] 

32.	Debt due to Government not extinguished by revocation

The revocation of a statutory right of occupancy shall not operate to extinguish any debt due to the Government under or in respect of such right of occupancy.

33.	Option to accept resettlement in case of revocation of right of occupancy

(1)	Where a right of occupancy in respect of any developed land on which a residential building has been erected is revoked under this Act, the Governor or the local government, as the case may be, may in his or its discretion offer in lieu of compensation payable in accordance with the provisions of this Act, resettlement in any other place or area by way of a reasonable alternative accommodation (if appropriate in the circumstances).

(2)	Where the value of any alternative accommodation as determined by the appropriate officer or the Land Use and Allocation Committee is higher than the compensation payable under this Act, the parties concerned may by agreement require that the excess in value in relation to the property concerned shall be treated as a loan which the person affected shall refund or repay to the Government in the prescribed manner.
