(1)	This Part of this Act shall apply to any person as if the expression 'owner' included the person responsible for the fault of any ship; but without prejudice thereto, where by virtue of any charter or demise or for any other reason, the owner is not responsible for the navigation and management of the ship, the expression shall be read and construed as though there were substituted therefor references to the charterer or other person so responsible.

(2)	References in this Part to damage or loss caused by the fault of a ship, shall be construed as in-cluding references to any salvage or other expenses consequent upon that fault recoverable at law by way of damages.

(3)	For the purposes of this section, 'ship' means every description of vessel used or intended for use in navigation, however propelled, and whether completed or in the course of construction or com-pletion.

(a)	if, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, it is not possible to establish different degrees of fault, the liability shall be apportioned equally;

(b)	nothing in this section shall operate so as to render any ship liable for any loss or damage to which her fault has not contributed; and

(c)	nothing in this section shall affect the liability of any person under a contract of carriage, or any contract, or shall be construed as imposing any liability upon any person from which he is exempted by any contract or by any provision of law, or as affecting the right of any person to limit his liability in the manner provided by law.

(2)	This section shall apply to Nigerian Government ships as it applies in the case of other ships.

340.	Damage for personal injury

341.	Right of contribution

(1)	Subject to the provisions of this section, where loss of life or personal injury is suffered by any person on board a ship owing to the fault of the ship and any other ship or ships, and a proportion of the damages is recovered against the owners of one of the ships which exceeds the proportion in which the ship was in fault, the owners of that ship may recover, by way of contribution, the amount of the excess from the owners of the other ship or ships to the extent to which those ships were respectively in fault.

(2)	No amount shall be recovered as provided in subsection (1) of this section which could not, by reason of any statutory or contractual limitation of, or exemption from, liability, or which could not, for any other reason, have been recovered in the first instance as damages by the person entitled to sue therefor.

(2)	An action shall not be maintainable under this Act to enforce any contribution in respect of an overpaid proportion of any damages for loss of life or personal injuries unless proceedings in that respect are commenced within one year from the date of payment.

(3)	Any court of competent jurisdiction may extend the period on such conditions as it thinks fit and shall, if satisfied that during the period there has not been a reasonable opportunity of arresting the defendant ship at any port in Nigeria, or within three miles of the coast of Nigeria or locally within the jurisdiction of the country to which the ship of the plaintiff belongs or in which the plaintiff resides or has his principal place of business, extend the period to the extent necessary to give such a reasonable opportunity.

FIRST SCHEDULE

[Regulations 3 (2) and (3), 4, 5, 6,11 (2), 13 (2), and 15.]

Measurement of Tonnage

RULE I

1.	Underdeck Tonnage

(1)	The length of the tonnage deck shall be measured in a straight line in the middle plane of the ship between the points at the forward and after ends of the deck where the underside of the deck or the line of continuation thereof in way of breaks or discontinuations of the deck meets the inner face of the frames, timbers, ceiling or sparring, as the case may be. Such length so measured is hereinafter referred to in this Schedule and in the Second Schedule to these Regulations as the 'tonnage length”.

(2)	In ships which have a break, or breaks in a double bottom, the tonnage length shall be measured in parts corresponding to the number and position of such break or breaks.

(3)	The tonnage length, or the length of each of the several parts obtained in accordance with sub- paragraph (2), shall be divided into equal parts as shown in the following table so that if the length of any of the several parts does not exceed 9 metres that length may be divided into 2 equal parts—

{a) length 15 metres or under, into 4 equal parts;

(6)	length above 15 metres	but	not exceeding	36 metres, into	6 equal parts;

(c)	length above 36 metres	but	not exceeding	54 metres, into	8 equal parts;

(id)	length above 54 metres	but	not exceeding	68 metres into	10 equal parts;

(e)	length above 68 metres, into 12 equal parts.

(4)	The transverse area of the ship at each point of division of the tonnage length or of parts of that length in sub-paragraph (3), shall be calculated as follows—

(a) the depth in the middle plane of the ship from the underside of the tonnage deck to the top of the open floor or double bottom as the case may be shall be measured, deducting the average thickness of ceiling, if fitted and one-third the round of beam. When making the calculation, if the top of the double bottom falls from the middle plane of the ship, there shall be added to the depth the mean of the fall and if the top of the double bottom rises from the middle plane, a corresponding correction shall be deducted from the depth; and in respect of ships of wooden construction, the lower terminal point of the depth shall be the upper side of the floor timber at the inside of the limber strake, after deducting the average thickness of ceiling between the bilge planks and the limber strake; 

(b)	if the depth obtained under sub-paragraph 4 {a) does not exceed 5 metres at the amidship division of the total tonnage length, the depth at each point of division of the tonnage length or parts of that length as, shall be divided into 4 equal parts; while depths in excess of 5 metres shall be divided into 6 equal parts;

(c)	at the point of division between each of the parts obtained under paragraph (4) (b) above, the horizontal breadths to the inner face of the timber, frame, or sparring, as the case may be, shall be measured. In numbering these breadths from the tonnage deck, the even numbered breadths shall be multiplied by 4 and the others, with the exception of the first and last, by 2; these products shall be added together and to the sum, there shall be added the first and last breadths; the quantity thus obtained shall be multiplied by one-third of the common interval between the breadths, and the product shall be the transverse area in square metres.

(5)	The transverse area obtained under sub-paragraph (4) of this paragraph shall be numbered from the extreme forward point of measurement of the tonnage length, or the parts thereof as the case may be; the even numbered areas shall be multiplied by 4 and the odd numbered areas, other than the first and last, by 2; these products shall be added together and to the sum there shall be added the area (if any) of the first and last; the quantity thus obtained shall be multiplied by one-third of the common interval between the areas; the product so obtained divided by 2.83 shall be the underdeck tonnage of the ship exclusive of the tonnage of spaces to be included therein pursuant to the paragraph appendages referred to in 4 (b) of these Regulations.

[First Schedule.]

2.	Between Deck Space between the Second Deck and the Upper Deck

(1)	The between deck space between the second deck and the upper deck shall be measured for length in a straight line in the middle plane of the ship between the points at the forward and after ends of the space where the inner surface of the frames, timber, ceiling, or sparring, as the case may be, meets the middle plane of the ship at half the height between the upper surface of the deck and underside of the deck over.

(2)	Where a break exists in the second deck or the upper deck, the line of the deck shall be extended through the break parallel to the raised part of the break; and the tonnage of the between deck space shall be measured in such a case by reference to the line of the deck so extended.

(3)	The length shall be divided into equal parts as provided in paragraph 1 (3) of this Rule. At each of these points of division the horizontal breadth from the inner face of the frames, timbers or sparring as the case may be shall be measured at half the height of the between deck space.

(4)	The breadths so obtained shall be numbered from the stem, the stem being number 1. The even numbered breadths shall be multiplied by 4 and the odd numbered, other than the first and the last, by 2. The products shall be added together and the first and last breadths shall be added to the sum. The resulting quantity shall be multiplied by one-third of the common interval between the breadths, and the area there-by found shall be multiplied by the mean height between the upper surface of the deck and the underside of the deck over. The product when divided by 2.83 shall be the tonnage of the between deck space.

3.	Breaks in the Upper Deck

The length of breaks in the upper deck shall be measured in a straight line in the middle plane of the ship between the extremities of the break at half the height of the break, terminal points at the stem or stem as described in paragraph 2 (1) and (2) of this Rule. The length obtained shall be divided into 2 equal parts for lengths of 15 metres or less, 4 equal parts for lengths above 15 metres but not more than 68 metres, and 6 equal parts for lengths over 68 metres. At each of the points of division the horizontal breadth at half the height of the break at the ship’s side to the inner face of the frames, timbers, or sparring, as the case may be, shall be measured. In numbering these breadths from the foremost terminal point, the even numbered breadths shall be multiplied by 4 and the odd numbered, other than the first and last, by 2. The products shall be added together and to the sum there shall be added the first and last breadths. The quantity obtained shall be multiplied by one-third of the common interval between the breadths. The area thus obtained shall be multiplied by the height of the break; and the product, when divided by 2.83, shall be the tonnage of the break.

4.	Poop, Bridge and Forecastle

A poop, bridge, or forecastle shall be measured as follows—

The mean length shall be measured at half the height between the upper surface of the deck and the underside of the deck over, terminal points at the stem and stem as described in paragraph 2(1) and (2) of this

Rule. The length obtained shall be divided into 2 equal parts for lengths of 15 metres or under, 4 equal parts for lengths over 15 metres but not exceeding 68 metres, and 6 equal parts for lengths exceeding 68 metres. At each of the points of division the horizontal breadth shall be measured from the inner face of the frames, timbers or sparring as the case may be at half between the upper surface of the deck and the underside of the deck over. In numbering these breadths from the foremost terminal point, the even numbered breadths shall be multiplied by 4 and the odd numbered, the first and last, by 2. The products shall be added together and to the sum there shall be added and first and last breadths. The quantity obtained shall be multiplied by one- third of the common interval between the breadths, and the area thus obtained shall be multiplied by the mean height of the poop, bridge or forecastle. The product when divided by 2.83, shall be the tonnage of the poop, bridge, or forecastle.

5.	Other Permanently Closed-in Spaces on or above the Upper Deck

Permanently closed-in spaces on or above the upper deck other than those dealt with in paragraph 4 shall be measured by ascertaining their mean length, breadth and height and the product of multiplying these dimensions together shall, when divided by 2.83, be the tonnage of the space.

6.	Propelling machinery space

(1)	Propelling machinery space which extends to the ship’s side and is situated below the upper deck shall be measured as follows—

The mean length shall be measured in each space at half the mean depth, which shall be measured in the middle plane of the ship from the underside of the deck forming the crown of the space to the top of the double bottom or open floors, allowance being made for ceiling if fitted; for amidship spaces 3 equally spaced breadths shall be used and for spaces abaft amidships 3 equally spaced breadths shall be used for lengths up to 9 metres, 5 equally spaced breadths for lengths over 9 metres, but not exceeding 15 metres, and 7 equally spaced breadths for lengths over 15 metres, the breadths being measured from the inner face of the frames, timbers or sparring as the case may be at half the depth of the space at that point. The mean length, mean breadth and mean depth so ascertained shall be multiplied together and the product when divided by 2.83, shall be the tonnage of the space.

(2)	Propelling machinery space which does not extend to the ship’s side and is situated below the upper deck shall be measured by ascertaining its mean length, mean breadth and mean depth and the product of multiplying these dimensions together shall’, when divided by 2.83, be the tonnage of the space.

7.	Shaft Bossings and Appendages.

The tonnage of shaft bossings and other appendages referred to in regulation 5 (b) of these Regulations shall be ascertained by measuring the internal cubic capacity of the space as accurately as practicable and dividing the result by 2.83.

RULE II

8.	Measurement of Tonnage below the Upper Deck where Measurement in Accordance with Rule I is Impracticable

The length of the ship shall be measured on the upper side of the upper deck from the inside of the outer plate or plank at the stem to the aft side of the stem-post, or to the fore side of the rudder stock where no stem-post is fitted. The extreme breadth of the ship shall be measured, excluding rubbers or fenders. The girth, from the upper edge of the upper deck at side on one side of the ship to the same point at the other side, shall be measured on the outside of the ship at the greatest breadth. To half the girth thus measured there shall be added half the earlier mentioned breadth. The square of the sum shall be multiplied by the earlier mentioned length. This product multiplied by .0017 in the case of ships built of wood and by .0018 in the case of other ships, shall be the tonnage of the ship below the upper deck.

9.	In any case in which the surveyor is satisfied that by reason of the size of the ship it is not reasonably practicable to measure its girth as provided in paragraph 1 of this Rule, the girth shall be ascertained by adding the earlier mentioned breadth of the ship to twice the depth of the ship from the top of the upper deck at the side of the ship to the bottom of the keel and multiplying this sum by 0.98.

RULE III

10.	Measurement of Open Ships

In ascertaining the tonnage of open ships, the upper edge of the upper strake is to form the boundary line of measurement, and the depth shall be taken from an athwartship line, extending from upper edge to upper edge of that strake at each division of the length.

SECOND SCHEDULE—continued

In the case of ships of intermediate breadths, the maximum depth of frame shall be obtained by interpolation.

THIRD SCHEDULE

[Regulations 11 (3) and 12 (2).]

1.	Tonnage Marks

Save as otherwise provided in paragraph 2 of this Schedule, the tonnage mark in the annex to this Schedule and there shown in Figure 1 shall consist of a horizontal line 2.5 centimetres long and 2.5 centimetres wide upon which shall be placed for identification purposes an inverted equilateral triangle, each side of which is 30.5 centimetres long and 2.5 centimetres wide, having its apex in the mid-point of the horizontal line.

2.	In the case of a ship intended to operate in fresh or tropical waters as’ defined in the Load Line Rules which is not a ship on which tonnage marks have been placed in accordance with regulation 11 of these Regulations, an additional horizontal line may on the application of the owner of the ship be placed above the tonnage mark described in paragraph 1 of this Schedule and at a distance of one forty-eighth (l/48th) of the moulded draught to that tonnage mark. This additional line shall be 23 centimetres long and 2.5 centimetres wide measured from a 2.5 centimetres wide vertical line (shown marked 'W' in Figure 1 aforesaid) at the after end of, and perpendicular to, that tonnage mark. In such a case, at all such times as the ship so marked is operating in fresh or tropical waters as aforesaid, this additional line shall be taken to be the tonnage mark in lieu of that described in paragraph 1 of this Schedule.

3.	The lines and triangle above mentioned shall be painted in white or yellow on a dark ground or in black on a light ground, and carefully cut in, centre punched or welded on the sides of the ship. They shall be so kept and maintained as to be plainly visible at all times save when submerged.

FOURTH SCHEDULE

[Regulations 11 (3) and 12 (2).]

1.	Position of Tonnage Marks

The tonnage mark shall be placed on each side of the ship at a distance below the line where the underside of the second deck stringer plate meets the ship’s side plating amidships or, where the deck is stepped, below the line equivalent to that line as shown in Figure 2 as Annex 'A' to this Schedule in a position to be ascertained by reference to the Tonnage Mark Table set out as Annex 'B' to this Schedule.

2.	In the application of the Tonnage Mark Table

(a)	the length shown as 'Lt' in column A is the distance in metres on the second deck between the points at the forward and after ends of the deck where the underside of the deck or line of continuation thereof meets the inner surface of the frames, ceiling, or sparring as the case may be, in the middle plane of the ship, using an equivalent length in cases where the deck is stepped its shown in the aforesaid Figure 2; and

(b)	the depth shown as 'Ds' in column A is the depth in metres amidships from the top of the keep to the point at which the underside of the second deck stringer plate meets the ship’s side plating, using an equivalent depth as shown in the aforesaid Figure 2 in cases where the deck is stepped;

(c)	the figures 12 to 20 respectively appearing at the top of the columns lettered B to J represent the ratio Lt/Ds, and the figures thereafter set out in each column represent distances in inches from the line where the underside of the second deck stringer plate meets the ship’s side plating amidships or, in cases where the deck is stepped, from the equivalent line thereto as shown in the aforesaid Figure 2 to the point at which the upper edge of the tonnage mark is to be placed. 

FOURTH SCHEDULE—continued

3.	In the case of any ship of intermediate length or having an intermediate Lt/Ds ratio, the relevant distance to be applied shall be obtained by interpolation and in other cases where necessary by linear extrapolation.

4.	The effect relevant distance calculated by reference to the Tonnage Mark Table to be applied in the case of any ship shall be corrected to the nearest millimetres.

5.	Subject to paragraph 6 of this Schedule, in the case of a ship to which load lines have been assigned, the tonnage marks shall, subject to the provisions of regulation 11 of these Regulations, be placed in a position ascertained in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule, with the apex of the identification triangle at a distance of 53 centimetres horizontally aft of the centre line of the line of load line disc so that where a timber load line has been assigned to the ship the distance shall be 107 centimetres.

Annex 'A'

6.	Where tonnage marks have been assigned they shall in no case be placed above the deepest load line to which the ship may be loaded and account shall not be taken of timber load lines when giving effect to this provision.

7.	In the case of a ship to which load lines have not been assigned, the tonnage marks shall be placed in a position ascertained in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule with the apex of the identification triangle at the middle of the length shown as 'Lf \ In every such case the line of the upper deck shall, be shown by a deck line corresponding in form to that required by the Load Line Rules and placed centrally to a vertical line bisecting the identification triangle of the tonnage mark.

10.	Lashings

(1)	The timber deck cargo shall be efficiently secured throughout its length by independent overall lashings spaced not more than 3 metres apart. Overall lashings shall be in good condition and shall con-sist of close link chain of not less than an inch, or flexible wire rope of equivalent strength, fitted with sliphooks and stretching screws, which shall be accessible at all times. Wire rope lashings shall have a short length of long link chain to permit the length of lashings to be regulated.

(2)	When the timber is in lengths of less than 3.6 metres, the spacing of the lashings shall be reduced to suit the length of timber, or other suitable provision made.

(3)	When the spacing of the lashings is one and a half metres or less, the size of the lashings may be reduced, not less than 25 mm chain or equivalent wire rope shall be used.

11.	Means of Securing Uprights

(1)	For the purpose of securing the uprights when these are required by the nature of the cargo, strong angles or metal sockets efficiently secured to the stringer plate or equally efficient means, shall be provided.

(2)	On superstructure decks, uprights, where fitted, shall be secured by athwartship lashings of am-ple strength.

12.	Interpretation

In these Rules, unless the context otherwise requires—

'freeboard deck' has the same meaning as in the Load Line Rules;

'Load Line Rules' means the rules made by the Minister under section 291 of the Act;

'Minister' means the Minister charged with the responsibility for transportation;

'superstructure deck' means the deck forming the top of a superstructure as defined in the Load Line Rules;

'timber deck cargo' means a cargo of timber carried on an uncovered part of a freeboard or super-structure deck, but does not include a cargo of wood pulp or similar substance;

'timber load line' means a special load line to be used only when a ship carrying a timber deck cargo complies with these Rules and the Load Line Rules.

(а)	on the territory of Nigeria or in Nigerian waters; or

(б)	in the exclusive economic zone of Nigeria;

2.	Geographical application: Convention ships

For Convention ships, these Regulations shall apply in respect of actual or anticipated pollution damage, irrespective of the actual or anticipated discharge of the pollutant and irrespective of the location where any preventive measures are taken to prevent or minimise such damage—

(a)	on the territory of Nigeria or in Nigerian waters; or

(b)	in the exclusive economic zone of Nigeria;

(c)	on the territory or in the territorial sea or internal waters or the exclusive economic zone of a country other than Nigeria which is a party to the Civil Liability Convention; or

PART II

Civil Liability for Pollution Damage

4.	Liability for pollution damage mid related costs

(1)	The following provisions shall, subject to regulation 5 of these Regulations, have effect in relation to pollution damage in Nigeria which is caused by a ship carrying oil in bulk as cargo, whether such ship is within or outside Nigeria—

{a) save as is otherwise provided by this Regulation, the owner of a ship at the time of the incident or, where the incident consists of a series of occurrences, at the time of the first of the occurrences, which caused pollution damage, shall be liable for such damage;

5.	Liability for environmental damage

If oil pollution damage from a ship results in impairment to the environment, the owner of the ship is liable for the costs of reasonable measures of reinstatement actually undertaken or to be undertaken.

6.	Exemption from liability for pollution damage

The owner of a ship which has caused pollution damage shall not be liable for such damage if he proves that the discharge of oil which caused the damage—

(a)	resulted from an act of war, hostilities, civil war, insurrection or a natural phenomenon of an exceptional, inevitable and irresistible character; or

(b)	was due wholly to anything done, or left undone, by any other person (other than a servant or agent of such owner) with intent to do damage; or

MERCHANTS SHIPPING (COLLISION) RULES

[S. I. 29 of 2010.]

[Date of commencement: 9th March, 2010]

In exercise of the powers conferred upon me by sections 265 and 434 or the Merchants Shipping

Act, 2007 and or all other powers enabling me in that behalf, I, Alhaji IBRAHIM ISA-Bio, Minister of Transport, hereby make the following Rules.

PARTI

General

1.	General application

(1)	These Rules shall apply to all vessels upon the high seas and in all waters connected therewith navigable by seagoing vessel.

(2)	Nothing in these Rules shall interfere with the operation of special rules made by an appropriate authority for roadsteads, harbours, rivers, lakes or inland waterways connected with the high seas and navigable by seagoing vessels. Such special rules shall conform us closely as possible to these Rules.

(3)	Nothing in these Rules shall interfere with the operation of any special rules made by the Gov-ernment of any State with respect to additional station or signal lights, shapes or whistle signals for ships of war and vessels proceeding under convoy, or with respect to additional station or signal lights or shapes for fishing vessels engaged in fishing as a fleet. These additional station or signal lights, shapes or whistle signals shall, so far as possible, be such that they cannot be mistaken for any light, shape or signal authorised elsewhere under these Rules,

(4)	Traffic separation schemes may be adopted by the Organisation for the purpose of these Rules.

(5)	Whenever the Government concerned shall have determined that a vessels of special construc-tion or purpose cannot comply fully with the provision of any of these Rules with respect to the number, position, range or arc of visibility of lights or shapes, as well as to the disposition and characteristics of sound-signaling appliances, without interfering with the special function of the vessel. Such vessel shall comply with such other provisions in regard to the number, position, range or are of visibility of lights or shapes, as well as to the disposition and characteristics of sound-signalling appliances, as her Government shall have determined to be the closest possible compliance with these Rules in respect to that vessel.

2.	Responsibility

(1)	Nothing in these Rules shall exonerate any vessel, or the owner, master or crew thereof, from the consequences of any neglect to comply with these Rules or of the neglect of any precaution which may be required by the ordinary practice of seamen, or by the special circumstances of the case.

(2)	In construing and complying with these Rules due regard shall be had to all dangers of naviga-tion and collision and to any special circumstances, including the limitations of the vessels involved, which may make a departure from these Rules necessary to avoid immediate danger.

PART II

Steering and Sailing Rules

A.	Conduct of Vessels in any Condition of Visibility

3.	Application of rules in this Part

Rules in this Part apply in any condition of visibility.

4.	Look-out

Every vessel shall at all times maintain a proper look-out by sight and hearing as well as by all available means appropriate in the prevailing circumstances and conditions so as to make a full appraisal of the situation and of the risk of collision.

5.	Safe speed

(1)	Every vessel shall at all times proceed at a safe speed so that she can take proper and effective action to avoid collision and be stopped within a distance appropriate to the prevailing circumstances and conditions.

(2)	In determining a safe speed the following factors shall be among those taken into account:

(a)	by all vessels—

(i)	the state of visibility;

(ii)	the traffic density including concentrations of fishing vessels or any other vessels;

(iii)	the manoeuverability of the vessel with special reference to stopping distance and turning ability in the prevailing conditions;

(iv)	at night the presence of bacKilogramsround light such as from shore lights or from back scatter of her own lights;

(EDITORIAL NOTE: Wording as per Gazette.)

(v)	the state of wind, sea and current, and the proximity of navigational hazards;

(vi)	the draught in relation to the available depth of water;

(b)	additionally, by vessels with operational radar—

(i)	the characteristics, efficiency and limitations of the radar equipment;

(ii)	any constraints imposed by the radar range scare in use;

(iii)	the effect or radar detection of the sea state, weather and other sources f interference;

(iv)	the possibility that small vessels, ice and other floating objects may not be detected by radar at an adequate range;

(v)	the number, location and movement of vessels detected by radar;

(vi)	the more exact assessment of the visibility that may be possible when radar is used to determine the range of vessels or other objects in the vicinity.

6.	Risk of collision

(1)	Every vessel shall use all available means appropriate to the prevailing circumstances and con-ditions to determine if risk of collision exists. If there is any doubt such risk shall beseemed to exist.

(2)	Proper use shall be made of radar equipment if fitted and operation, including long-range scanning to obtain early warning of risk of collision and radar plotting or equivalent systematic observation of detected objects.

(3)	Assumptions shall not be made on the basis of scanty information, especially scanty radar in-formation.

(4)	In determining if risk of collision exists the following considerations shall among those taken into account—

(a)	such risk shall be deemed to exist if the compass bearing an approaching vessel does not appreciably change; and

(b)	such risk may sometimes exist even when an appreciable bearing change is evident, particularly when approaching a very large vessel or a tow or when approaching a vessel at close range.

7.	Action to avoid collision

(1)	Any action to avoid collision (shall be taken in accordance with the Rules of this Part and) shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, be positive, made in ample time and with due regard to the ob-servance of good seamanship.

(2)	Any alteration of course and speed to avoid collision shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, be large enough to be readily apparent to another vessel observing visually or by radar, a succession of small alterations of course and speed should be avoided,

(3)	If there is sufficient sea room, alteration of course alone may be the most effective action to avoid a close-quarters situation provided that it is made in good time, is substantial and does not result in another close-quarters situation.

(4)	Action taken to avoid collision with another vessel shall be such as to result in passing at a safe distance. The effectiveness of the action shall be carefully checked until the other vessel is finally past and clear.

(5)	If necessary to avoid collision or allow more time to assess the situation, a vessel shall slacken her speed or take all way off by stopping reversing her means of propulsion.

(6)	A vessel—

(a)	which, by any of these Rules, is required not to impede the passage or safe passage of another vessel shall, when required by the circumstances of the case, take early action to allow sufficient sea room For the safe passage of the other vessel;

(b)	required not to impede the passage or safe passage of another vessel is not relieved of this obligation if approaching the other vessel so as to involve risk of collision and shall, when taking action, have full regard to the action which may be required by the Rules of this part;

(c)	the passage of which is not to be impeded remains fully obliged to comply with the Rules of this part when the two vessels are approaching one another so as to involve risk of collision.

8.	Narrow channels

(1) A vessel proceeding along the course of a narrow channel or fairway shall keep as near to the outer limit of the channel or fairway which lies on her starboard side as is safe and practicable. 

(2)	A vessel of less than 20 metres in length or a sailing vessel shall not impede the passage of a vessel which can safely navigate only within a narrow channel or fairway.

(3)	A vessel engaged in fishing shall not impede the passage of any other vessel navigating within a narrow channel or fairway.

(4)	A vessel shall not cross a narrow channel or fairway if such crossing impedes the passage of a vessel which can safely navigate only within such channel or fairway and the latter vessel may use the sound signal prescribed in rule 34 (d) if in doubt as to the intention of the crossing vessel:

(a)	in a narrow channel or fairway when overtaking can take place only if the vessel to be over-taken has to take action to permit safe passing, the vessel intending to overtake shall indicate her intention by sounding the appropriate signal prescribed in rule 32 (c) (i);

(b)	the vessel to be overtaken shall, if in agreement, sound the appropriate signal prescribed in rule 32 (c) (ii) and take steps to permit safe passing. If in doubt she may sound the signals prescribed in rule 32 (d); and

(c)	this Rule does not relieve the overtaking vessel of her obligation, under rule 12.

(5)	A vessel nearing a bend or an area of a narrow channel or fairway where other vessels may be obscured by an intervening obstruction shall navigate with particular alertness and caution and shall sound the appropriate signal prescribed in rule 33 (e).

(6)	Any vessel shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, avoid anchoring in a narrow channel.

9.	Traffic separation schemes

(1)	This Rule applies to traffic separation schemes adopted by the Organization (and does not relieve any vessel of her obligation under any other Rule).

(2)	A vessel using a traffic separation scheme shall—

(a)	proceed in the appropriate traffic lane in the general direction of traffic flow for that lane;

(b)	so far as practicable keep clear of a traffic separation line or separation zone;

(c)	normally join or leave a traffic lane at the termination of the lane, but when joining or pra-cticable.

(3)	A vessel shall, so far as practicable, avoid crossing traffic lanes, but if obliged to do so shall cross as nearly as practicable at right angles to the general direction of traffic flow.

(4)	A vessel shall not use an inshore traffic zone when she can safely use the appropriate traffic lane within the adjacent traffic separation scheme. However, vessels of less than 20 metres in length, sailing vessels and vessels engaged in fishing may use the inshore traffic zone.

(5)	Notwithstanding paragraph (6), a vessel may use an inshore traffic zone when en route to or from a port, offshore installation or structure, pilot station or any other place situated within the inshore traffic zone, or to avoid immediate danger.

(6)	Inshore, traffic zones shall not normally be used by through traffic which can safely use the ap-propriate traffic lane within the adjacent traffic separation scheme.

(7)	A vessel, other than a crossing vessel or a vessel joining or leaving a Lane shall not normally enter a separation zone or cross a separation line except—

(a)	in cases of emergency to avoid immediate danger;

(b)	to engage in fishing within a separation zone.

(8)	A vessel navigating in areas near the terminations of traffic separation schemes shall do so with particular caution.

(9)	A vessel shall so far as practicable avoid anchoring in a traffic separation scheme or in areas near its terminations.

(10)	A vessel not using a traffic separation scheme shall avoid it by as wide a margin as is practicable.

(11)	A vessel engaged in fishing shall not impede the passage of any vessel following a traffic lane.

(12)	A vessel of less than 20 metres in length or a sailing vessel shall not impede the safe passage of a power-driven vessel following a traffic lane.

(13)	A vessel restricted in her ability, to manoeuvre when engaged in an operation for the mainte-nance of safety of navigation in a traffic separation scheme is exempted from complying with this Rule to the extent necessary to carry out the operation.

(14)	A vessel restricted in her ability to manoeuvre when engaged in an operation for the laying, servicing or picking up of a submarine cable, within a traffic separation scheme, is exempted from complying with this Rule to the extent necessary to carry out the operation.

B.	Conduct of Vessels in Sight of one Another

10.	Vessels in sight of one another

Rules in this Part apply to vessels in sight of one another.

11.	Sailing vessels

(1)	When two sailing vessels are approaching one another, so as to involve risk of collision, one of them shall keep out of the way of the other as follows—

(a)	when each has the wind on a different side, the vessel which has the wind on the port, side shall keep out of the way of the other;

(b)	when both have the wind on the same side, the vessel which is to windward shall keep out of the way of the vessel which is to leeward;

(c)	if a vessel with the wind on the portside sees a vessel to windward and cannot determine with certainty whether the other vessel has the wind on the port or on the starboard side, she shall keep out of the way of the other.

(2)	For the purposes of this Rule the windward side shall be deemed to be the side opposite to that on which the mainsail is carried or, in the case of a square-rigged vessel, the side opposite to that on which the largest fore- and-aft sail is carried.

12.	Overtaking

(1)	Notwithstanding anything contained in these Rules any vessel overtaking any other shall keep out of the way of the vessel being overtaken.

(2)	A vessel shall be deemed to be overtaking when coming up with another vessel from a direction more than 22.5 degrees abaft her beam, that is, in such a position with reference to the vessel she is overtaking, that at night she would be able to see only the stemlight of that vessel but neither of her sidelights.

(3)	When a vessel is in any doubt as to whether she is overtaking another, she shall assume that this is the case and act accordingly.

(4)	Any subsequent alteration of the bearing between the two vessels shall not make the overtaking vessel a crossing vessel within the meaning of these Rules or relieve her of the duty of keeping clear of the overtaken vessel until she is finally past and clear.

13.	Head-on situation

(1)	When two power-driven vessels are meeting on reciprocal or nearly reciprocal courses so as to involve risk of collision each shall alter her course to starboard so that each shall puss on the port side of the other.

(2)	Such a situation shall be deemed to exist when a vessel sees the other ahead or nearly ahead and by night she could see the masthead lights of the other in a line or nearly in a line or both sidelights and by day she observes the corresponding aspect of the other vessel.

(3)	When a vessel is in any doubt as to whether such a situation exists she shall assume that it does exist and act accordingly.

14.	Crossing situation

When two power-driven vessels are crossing so as to involve risk of collision, the vessel which has the other on her own starboard side shall keep out of the way and shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, avoid crossing ahead of the other vessel.

15.	Action by give-way vessel

Every vessel which is directed by these Rules to keep out of the way of another vessel shall, so far as possible, lake early and substantial action to keep well clear.

16.	Action by Stand-on vessel

(1)	Where by any of these Rules one of two vessels is to keep out of the way the other shall keep her course and speed and the latter vessel may however take action to avoid collision by her manoeuvre alone, as soon us it becomes apparent to her that the vessel required to keep out of the way is not taking appropriate action in compliance with these Rules.

(2)	When, from any cause, the vessel required to keep her course and speed finds herself so close that collision cannot be avoided by the action of the give-way vessel alone, she shall take such action as will best aid to avoid collision.

(3)	A power-driven vessel which takes action in a crossing situation in accordance with paragraph (1) of this Rule to avoid collision with another power-driven vessel shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, not alter course to port for a vessel on her own port side.

(4)	This rule does not relieve the give-way vessel of her obligation to keep out of the way.

17.	Responsibilities between vessels

(1) Except where Rules 8, 9 and 12 otherwise require—

{a) a power-driven vessel underway shall keep out of the way of—

(i)	a vessel not under command;

(ii)	a vessel restricted in her ability to manoeuvre;

(iii)	a vessel engaged in fishing;

(iv)	a sailing vessel;

(b)	a sailing vessel underway shall keep out of the way of—

(i)	a vessel not under command;

(ii)	a vessel restricted in her ability to manoeuvre;

(iii)	a vessel engaged in fishing;

(c)	a vessel engaged in fishing when underway shall, so far as possible, keep out of the way—

(i) a vessel not under command; 

(ii) a vessel restricted in her ability to manoeuvre.

(2)	Any vessel other than a vessel not under command or a vessel restricted in her ability to ma-noeuvre shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, avoid impeding the safe passage of a vessel con-strained by her draught, exhibiting the signals in rule 27.

(3)	A vessel constrained by her draught shall navigate with particular caution having full regard to her special condition.

(4)	A seaplane on the water shall, in general, keep well clear of all vessels and avoid impeding their navigation. In circumstances, however, where risk of collision exists, she shall comply with the Rules of this Part.

(5)	A WIG craft—

(a)	shall, when taking off, landing and in flight near the surface, keep well, clear of all other vessels and avoid impeding their navigation;

(b)	operating on the water surface shall comply with the Rules of this Part as a power-driven vessel.

C.	Conduct of Vessels in Restricted Visibility

V

18.	Conduct of vessels in restricted visibility

(1)	This Rule applies to vessels not in sight of one another when navigating in or near an area of re-stricted visibility.

(2)	Every vessel shall proceed at a safe speed adapted to the prevailing circumstances arid condi-tions of restricted visibility. A power-driven vessel shall have her engines ready for immediate manoeuvre.

(3)	Every vessel shall have due regard to the prevailing circumstances and conditions of restricted visibility when complying with the rules of this Part.

(4)	A vessel which detects by radar alone the presence of another vessel shall determine if a close- quarters situation is developing or risk of collision exists. If so, she shall take avoiding action in ample time, provided that when such action consists of an alteration of course, so far as possible the following shall be avoided—

(a)	an alteration of course to port for a vessel forward of the beam, other than for a vessel being overtaken;

(b)	an alteration of course towards a vessel abeam or abaft the beam,

(5)	Except where it has been determined that a risk of collision does not exist, every vessel which hears apparently forward of her beam the fog signal of another vessel, or which cannot avoid a close- quarters situation with another vessel forward of her beam, hall reduce her speed to the minimum at which she can be kept on her course. She shall if necessary take all her way off and in any event navigate with extreme caution until danger of collision is over.

1.	(1) Frequencies and range of audibility—

(a)	the fundamental frequency of the signal shall lie within the range 70-700 Hz;

(b)	the range of audibility of the signal from a whistle shall be determined by those frequencies, which may include the fundamental and/or one or more higher frequencies, which lie within the range 180-70QHz (±1%) for a vessel of 20 metres or more in length, or 180-2100Hz (±1%) for a vessel of less than 20 metres in length and which provide the sound pressure levels specified in paragraph 1 (c) below.

(2)	Limits of fundamental frequencies'. To ensure a wide variety of whistle characteristics, the fundamental frequency of a whistle shall be between the following limits—

(a)	70-200 Hz, for a vessel 200 metres or more in length;

(b)	130-350 Hz. for a vessel 75 metres but less than 200 metres in length;

(c)	250-700 Hz. for a vessel less than 75 metres in length.

(3)	Sound signal intensity and range of audibility—

(a) a whistle fitted in a vessel shall provide, in the direction of maximum intensity of the whistle and at a distance of 1 metre from it, a sound pressure level in at least one l/3rd-octave band within the range of frequencies 180-700 Hz (±1%) for a vessel of 20 metres or more in length, or 180-2100Hx (±1%) for a vessel of less than 20 metres in length, of not less than the appropriate figure given in the table below—

(b)	at any other direction in the horizontal plant shall be not more than 10 dB below the pre-scribed the sound pressure level on the axis, so that the range in any direction will be at least half the range on the forward axis.

(c)	shall be measured in that l/3rd-octane band which determines the audibility range.

(5)	Positioning of whistles—

(a)	when a directional whistle is to be used as the only whistle on a vessel, it shall be installed with its maximum intensity directed straight ahead;

(b)	a whistle shall be placed as high as practicable on a vessel, in order to reduce interception of the emitted sound by obstructions and also to minimize hearing damage risk to personnel.

(c)	the sound pressure level of the vessel’s own signal at listening posts shall not exceed llOdb (A) and so far as practicable should not exceed 100 dB (A).

(6)	Pilling of more than one whistle: If whistles are fitted at a distance ipart of more than 100 metres, it shall be so arranged that they are not sounded simultaneously. 

(7)	Combined whistle systems—

(a)	if due to the presence of obstructions the sound field of a single whistle or of one of the whistles referred to in sub-paragraph (6) of this paragraph is likely to have a zone of greatly reduced signal level, it is recommended that a combined whistle system be fitted so as to overcome this reduction;

(b)	for the purposes of the rules a combined whistle system is to be regarded as a single whistle;

(c)	the whistles of a combined system shall be located at a distance apart or not more than 100 metres and arranged to be sounded simultaneously.

(d)	the frequency of any one whistle shall differ from those of the others by at least 10Hz.

B.	Bell or Gong

2.	(1) Intensity of signal: A bell or gong, or other device having similar sound characteristics shall produce a sound pressure level of not less than 110 db at a distance of I metre from it.

4.6.3.	The location of the test shall be chosen so that the density of water during the test is no greater than that on the route for which a vessel is to be certificated.

4.6.4.	The construction of vessels shall be complete in all respects.

4.6.5.	Ballast, where necessary, shall be on board and in place and shall be in compliance with 4.10.

4.6.6.	Each fuel and water tank shall be approximately three-quarters full.

4.6.7.	A weight equal to the total weight of all passengers, crew, and other loads permitted on a vessel shall be on board and distributed so as to provide normal operating trim and to simulate the vertical centre of gravity causing the least stable condition that is likely to occur in service. For this purpose, the crew shall be counted as passengers. If a vessel carries passengers on diving excursions, the total weight of the diving gear shall be included in the loaded condition.

4.6.8.	The heel of a vessel prior to the commencement of the stability proof test shall not exceed 2 degrees.

4.6.9.	Unless otherwise specified, weight and vertical centre of gravity shall be as follows—

(a)	the weight of primary lifesaving equipment shall be simulated at its normal location, if not on board at the time of the test;

(b)	the weight of one person shall be taken as 75kg except that where a vessel operates exclusively on sheltered waters or when passenger loads invariably consist of a mix of adults and children, the weight of one person may be taken as 65kg; and

(c)	the vertical centre of gravity of the simulated weight of passengers, crew, and other loads shall be at least 760 mm above the relevant deck.

4.6.10.	On vessels having one upper deck available to passengers above the main deck, the vertical weight distribution shall not be less than the following—

Weight on Upper Deck = (Number of passengers located on upper deck) x (weight per passenger) x 1.33;

4.7.1.	The heeling moments to be applied in order to demonstrate, the stability of vessels by means of calculation or a stability proof test shall be the greater of—

(a)	Mp = (W) x (Bp)/6; and

(b)	Mw =P x A x H where:

Mp = passenger heeling moment (kg-m);

W = the total passenger weight using 75 kg per passenger or, where the vessel operates exclusively on sheltered waters, 65 kg per passenger;

Bp = the maximum transverse distance (m) of a deck that is accessible to passengers;

Mw = wind heeling moment (kg-m);

P = wind pressure of—

(i)	36.6 kg/m2 for operation on sheltered waters; or

(ii)	73.3 kg/m2 for operation on open waters;

A = area (m2) of the projected lateral surface of the vessel above the waterline, including each projected area of the hull, superstructure and area bounded by railings and structural canopies. For sailing vessels this is the bare poles area, or, where the vessel has no auxiliary power, with storm sails set; and

H = height (m) of the centre of area (A) above the waterline, measured up from the waterline.

4.7.2.	In a stability proof test the moment determined in accordance with 4.7.1 shall be applied by means of a weight or weights placed at a transverse distance from the centreline of a vessel so that the product of the weight^) and distance^) is equal to the required moment. When a vessel is subjected to this heeling moment, the immersion of the loading mark shall not exceed the percentage of the freeboard as follows—

(a)	on a flush deck vessel, fifty per cent;

(b)	on a well deck vessel, fifty per cent; or

one hundred per cent where the vessel operates on sheltered waters, has non-return scuppers or freeing ports and the minimum freeboard is not more than one-quarter of the vertical distance from the waterline to the gunwale;

(c)	On a cockpit vessel, the percentage is calculated from the following— on open waters: (2L - 1.5LN)/4L

on sheltered waters: (2L - LN)/4L where: L = length of the weather deck; and LN = length of cockpit in the same units as L;

(d)	on an open boat, twenty-five per cent; and

(e)	on a flush deck sailing vessel, one hundred per cent.

4.7.3.	Notwithstanding the percentages specified in 4.7.2, when a vessel is subject to the greater of the heeling moments determined according to 4.7.1, the immersion shall not exceed a value equivalent to one-eighth of the breadth of the vessel measured at the point of minimum freeboard as defined in 4.1.1.

4.7.4.

14.1.	Interpretation.—In Chapter 14, unless inconsistent with the context—

'bunker oil or heavy fuel' means oil, with the exception of lubricating oil, used to power the vessel’s main or auxiliary machinery;

'designated waterway' means an inland waterway that has been designated {insert ref-erence to process or relevant law governing pollution of waterways) for the purpose of the prevention of pollution;

'discharge' means any release or discharge, howsoever caused, being part of the opera-tion of the vessel. The term includes escape, disposal, spilling, leaking, pumping or emit-ting;

'garbage' means all kinds of waste generated during the normal operation of the vessel such as food residues, glass, earthenware and china, metal protective and packing material, dunnage and sweepings from cargo spaces;

'heavy diesel oil' means diesel oil other than those distillates the volume of which is reduced by more than fifty per cent at a temperature not exceeding 340°C when tested by ASTM standard 'method D. 86/59;

'oil mixture' means any substance containing any oil having an oil content of more than 100 parts per million by volume;

'plastic wastes' means all plastics comprising products such as plastic-coated packaging material, synthetic rope and fishing nets;

'rate of discharge of oil at any point of time' means the rate of discharge of oil in litres per hour at any point in time divided by the speed of the vessel in knots at the same point of time;

'vessel’s wastes' means all forms of waste arising from general running of the vessel including, inter alia, plastic wastes and garbage, as defined. Fresh fish and parts thereof are not considered as vessel’s wastes; and

'sewage' means drainage and other wastes from any form of toilets, urinals, wash basins, wash tubs and water closet scuppers.

14.2.	Prohibition

14.2.1.	Unless otherwise provided in 14.3. the discharge of an oil mixture into a designated waterway is prohibited.

14.2.2.	The dumping of any kind of vessel’s waste into a designated waterway is pro-hibited.

14.2.3.	The dumping of any kind of plastic wastes into a designated waterway is prohibited.

14.2.4.	The discharge of sewage into a designated waterway is prohibited.

14.3. Exemptions

14.3.1.	The provisions of 14.2 shall not apply to—

(a)	the discharge of oil or oil mixture from a vessel for the purposes of se-curing the safety of a vessel, preventing damage to a vessel or cargo or saving of life on a designated waterway;

(b)	the escape of oil or oil mixture resulting from damage to a vessel or unavoidable leakage, provided that all reasonable precautions have been taken after the occurrence of the damage or discovery of the leakage for the purpose of preventing or minimising the escape; or

(c)	the dumping of wastes or the discharge of sewage when this is necessary to secure the safety of the vessel or the health of persons on board or to save life. The same applies to the discharge of wastes occurring as a result of damage to the vessel, provided that all reasonable measures have been taken to prevent or minimize such discharge.

14.5.	Reception facilities and discharge of wastes

14.5.1.	The Administration shall undertake to ensure the provision of adequate reception facilities at inland waterway ports and terminals for the reception from vessels of oily waste, sewage and garbage without causing undue delay.

Notes:

(iTest Weight ' defines only the weight to be moved during the test, Weights used to represent cargo and unfitted equipment or stores shall be simulated as part of the 'loaded condition'

The maximum number of passengers shall not exceed the number permitted in accordance with regulation 4.8. Passenger numbers and cargo quantities may need to be calculated iteratively as the test proceeds in order to ensure that the vessel meets the test criteria.

Weight per passenger shall be taken as—

75kg for vessels operating on open waters; and

65kg for vessels operating on sheltered waters.

A2.3. DISTRIBUTION OF TEST WEIGHT:

(a)	Distribute the test weight fore and aft so as to obtain the normal operating trim.

(b)	Arrange the test weight so that its vertical center of gravity (CG) is approximately 800 mm above the deck.

(c)	The vertical distribution of the test weight shall be such as to simulate the most unfavourable vertical CG likely to occur in service. On vessels having one upper deck above the main deck available to passengers, the vertical weight distribution shall not be less severe than the following:

Total test weight (W)	=	

Passenger capacity of upper deck {regulation 4.6.10):

Weight on upper deck = Number of passengers located on upper deck x weight per pas-senger x 1.33 Weight on upper deck =	x	x 1.33 =	kg/tonne

Weight on main deck = Total test weight - weight on upper deck

Weight on main deck =	-	=	kg/tonne

(id)	The athwartships position of the center of gravity of each of the weights compris

ing the total test weight shall be as close as is practicable to the edge of the deck.

A2.4. LOCATION OF IMMERSION MARK (I) ABOVE LOAD WATERLINE PRIOR TO APPLICATION OF HEELING MOMENT

A2.4.1. The Reference Freeboard (/) shall be measured at the Reference Station with the weight on board in accordance with A2.2. The height of the immersion mark (i) above the LWL shall be the lesser of the two values from:

A2.4.7.; or

A2.4.3. to A2.4.6. inclusive, according to vessel type.

A2.4.2. A temporary mark representing the value of (/) shall be placed on the hull above the LWL at the Reference Station on the side of the vessel that is immersed during the test. 

ANNEX 2—continued

A2.4.3. Flush deck type vessels, including all well deck vessels except those classified in (a) above For well deck vessels, freeboard (f) to the lowest deck exposed to the weather must equal or exceed 250 mm. If less than 250 mm, use 4 (d) Open-boat type formula.

A2.5. WEIGHT MOVEMENT:

{a) The maximum heeling moment required by A2.2 shall be obtained by a transverse movement of the test weights, in approximately four stages, to the position(s) de-fined in A2.3.

(b)	The test shall be conducted with all tanks 3/4 full, ballast aboard and securely in place, all portlights closed, and any non-return valves or flaps on scuppers and deck drains secured in the open position.

(c)	The vessel shall be fully afloat and all mooring slack during the test.

(d)	During the loading and moving of test weights, care should be taken to ascertain whether there is any evidence of low stability. This may be assumed to be the case whenever the effect of any added or shifted weight increment is noted to be more than that of the preceding increment of the same size, or when the chine or bilge amidships comes out of the water as a result of the heel.

(e)	Care shall be taken that the vessel does not heel excessively either due to weight movement or superimposed roll which could cause the test weights to topple or the vessel’s gear to move.

(/)	While the vessel is heeled, check for open seams, loose hull Fittings, etc., that are

not normally immersed and which could cause flooding of the vessel.

4.7.4	in such a case).

(b)	When the moment required by A2.2 has been developed, measure the resulting height of the immersion mark (i) above the waterline.

ANNEX 2—continued

(c)	If any portlights are located at a vertical distance above the waterline of 100 mm or less following the application of the required heeling moment, such portlights on each side shall be closed in a permanent manner. An appropriate notice shall be fixed inside the relevant compartment, close to each such portlight {regulation 4.7.5).

(d)	If any scuppers or drains are found to be below the waterline following the appli-cation of the required heeling moment so as to permit entry of water into the vessel or onto the deck, such openings on each side shall be fitted with automatic non-return valves {regulation 4.7.6).

A2.8.1. Procedure, for twenty-five per cent test.—This test is not a required part of the stability proof test but may be used as a preliminary check when the stability is believed to be marginal.

A2.8.2. After the total test weight (W) has been placed on board and the Reference free-board (j) has been measured, rig a pendulum free to swing athwartships at any convenient location on the vessel. The plumb bob should be approximately 3 mm above the deck. Place a chalk mark on the deck directly beneath the plumb bob. Measure the pendulum length (pO as the distance from the pivot to the deck.

A2.8.3. Move the test weight to obtain a heeling moment equal to one-quarter of the required heeling moment in A2.2. The weights having the longest levers may be moved so as to minimize the amount of weight handled.

1.	The vessel shall be in maximum load condition (4.6.7) except that the fuel and water tanks are to be three-quarters full (4.6.6). Ballast, if required, shall be on board and in place (4.6.5 and 4.10). A capacity load of passengers, crew, cargo, vehicles, stores, etc., shall be on board (or the weight equivalent thereto) in the proper locations (4.6.7).

2.	The vessel shall be afloat in water of a density not greater than that of the route and service for which it is to be certificated, i.e., salt water or fresh water for a vessel that is to be certificated for service on coastal or inland waters respectively (4.6.3).

3.	The vessel shall be at its normal trim, i.e., at a waterline established by the normal distribution of the weight on board (4.6.7). The vessel shall be upright. Any list greater than 2° shall be corrected by transverse movement of some of the weight on board so that the vessel is upright in the water, or nearly so (4.6.8).

4.	The measurements required for the calculation in Table A3-1 shall be taken carefully as applicable to the type of vessel and recorded. The length (L) (4.9.3) is the length of the hull, measured over the bulkhead deck, and shall not include fishing platforms, bowsprits, guards, rails, etc. The depth (D)

(4.9.3)	is especially important and should be double-checked. If the depth cannot be measured amid-ships, as required, due to obstructions, etc., it shall be measured at points fore and aft of, and equidistant from, amidships and the mean thereof recorded as (D). The breadth (B) as defined in 1.2 shall be measured amidships to the outside of the hull and shall not include any rubbing strakes or guards. The freeboards (/) at the position of each bulkhead shall be measured from the load waterline to the top of the bulkhead deck at side. The distance from the bow to each bulkhead shall be indicated on the profile in Figure A3-1 in the same manner as indicated for bulkheads 'A' and 'B”.

5.	Where a vessel has no scuttles or portlights that can be opened and is flush decked with normal sheer or no sheer, the dimensions shall be recorded on Figure A3-1 and the calculations completed as shown in Figure A3-1.

6.	Where a vessel has scuttles, portholes or portlights that can be opened, or if it is flush decked with reverse sheer or has a raised deck forward (as in the case of the typical cockpit boat), the profile on Figure A3-1 shall not be used Instead, an accurately scaled profile of the vessel shall be prepared, on which the locations of the bulkheads, and the scuttles, portholes or portlights, if any, shall be indicated. The 'corrected bulkhead deck line' shall be drawn on the profile as shown under the heading 'Special cases' in Figure A3-2 to Figure A3-5 inclusive (sheets 4 or 5), and the calculations completed as shown in Figure A3-1.

7.	The actual compartment lengths in Column 10 of Table A3-1 shall not exceed the calculated permissible lengths or 0.333L, whichever is the lesser (4.9.3).

8.	If the actual compartment lengths exceed the permissible lengths or 0.333L, remedial action shall be taken as required by the Administration (4.9.6).

A7.2.	Conduct of Vessels—General

A7.2.1. Look out.—Every vessel shall at all times maintain a proper look-out by sight and hearing as well as by all available means appropriate in the prevailing cir-cumstances and conditions so as to make a full appraisal of the situation and of the risk of collision.

A7.2.2.	Safe speed.—Every vessel shall at all times proceed at a safe speed so that it

can take proper and effective action to avoid collision and be stopped within a distance appropriate to the prevailing circumstances and conditions. In deter-mining a safe speed the following factors shall be among those taken into ac-count—

(a)	the state of visibility;

(b)	the traffic density, including concentrations of fishing vessels or any other vessels;

(c)	the manoeuvrability of the vessel with special reference to stopping distance and turning ability in the prevailing conditions;

{d) at night the presence of background light such as from shore lights or from back scatter of its own lights;

(e)	the state of wind and current, and the proximity of navigational hazards;

if)	the draught in relation to the available depth of water; and

(g)	by vessels with operational radar, any factors relating to the circum

stances relevant to the characteristics of the radar in use.

PART III

I. Principles to be Observed in Keeping a Navigational Watch

12.	The officer in charge of the navigational watch is the master’s representative and is primarily responsible at all times for the safe navigation of the ship and for complying with the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972.

13.	Look-out.—A proper look-out shall be maintained at all times in compliance with rule 5 of the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 and shall serve the purpose of—

(1)	maintaining a continuous state of vigilance by sight and hearing as well as by all other available means, with regard to any significant change in the operating environment;

(2)	fully appraising the situation and the risk of collision, stranding and other dangers to navigation; and

(3)	detecting ships or aircraft in distress, shipwrecked persons, wrecks, debris and other hazards to safe navigation.

14.	The look-out must be able to give full attention to the keeping of a proper look-out and no other duties shall be undertaken or assigned which could interfere with that task.

15.	The duties of the look-out and helmsperson are separate and the helmsperson shall not be con-sidered to be the look-out while steering, except in small ships where an unobstructed all-round view is provided at the steering position and there is no impairment of night vision or other impediment to the keeping of a proper look-out. The officer in charge of the navigational watch may be the sole look-out in daylight provided that on each such occasion—

(1)	the situation has been carefully assessed and it has been established without doubt that it is safe to do so;

(2)	full account has been taken of all relevant factors including, but not limited to—

-	state of weather,

-	visibility,

-	traffic density,

-	proximity of dangers to navigation, and

-	the attention necessary when navigating in or near traffic separation schemes; and

(3)	assistance is immediately available to be summoned to the bridge when any change in the situation so requires

16.	In determining that the composition of the navigational watch is adequate to ensure that a proper look-out can continuously be maintained, the master shall take into account all relevant factors, including those described in this section of the Code, as well as the following factors—

(1) visibility, state of weather and sea;

ANNEX 9—continued

(2)	traffic density, and other activities occurring in the area in which the vessel is navigat-ing;

(3)	the attention necessary when navigating in or near traffic separation schemes or other routeing measures;

(4)	the additional workload caused by the nature of the ship’s functions, immediate oper-ating requirements and anticipated manoeuvres;

(5)	the fitness for duty of any crew members on call who are assigned as members of the watch;

(6)	knowledge of and confidence in the professional competence of the ship’s officers and crew;

(7)	the experience of each officer of the navigational watch, and the familiarity of that officer with the ship’s equipment, procedures, and manoeuvring capability;

(8)	activities taking place on board the ship at any particular time, including radiocommu-nication activities and the availability of assistance to be summoned immediately to the bridge when necessary;

(9)	the operational status of bridge instrumentation and controls, including alarm systems;

(10)	rudder and propeller control and ship manoeuvring characteristics;

(11)	the size of the ship and the field of vision available from the conning position;

(12)	the configuration of the bridge, to the extent such configuration might inhibit a member of the watch from detecting by sight or hearing any external development; and

(13)	any other relevant standard, procedure or guidance relating to watchkeeping arrange-ments and fitness for duty which has been adopted by the Organization.

17.	Watch arrangements.—When deciding the composition of the watch on the bridge, which may include appropriately qualified ratings, the following factors, inter alia, shall be taken into account—

(1)	at no time shall the bridge be left unattended;

(2)	weather conditions, visibility and whether there is daylight or darkness;

(6)	whether there are radio duties to be performed;,.

(7)	unmanned machinery space (UMS) controls, alarms and indicators provided on the bridge, procedures for their use and limitations; and

(8)	any unusual demands on the navigational watch that may arise as a result of special operational circumstances.

18.	Taking over the watch.—The officer-in-charge of the navigational watch shall not hand over the watch to the relieving officer if there is reason to believe that the latter is not capable of carrying out the watchkeeping duties effectively, in which case the master shall be notified.

19.	The relieving officer shall ensure that the members of the relieving watch are fully capable of performing their duties, particularly as regards their adjustment to night vision. Relieving officers shall not take over the watch until their vision is fully adjusted to the light conditions.

ANNEX 9—continued

20.	Prior to taking over the watch relieving officers shall satisfy themselves as to the ship’s estimated or true position and confirm its intended track, course and speed, and UMS controls as appropriate and shall note any dangers to navigation expected to be encountered during their watch.

21.	Relieving officers shall personally satisfy themselves regarding the—

(1)	standing orders and other special instructions of the master relating to navigation of the ship;

29.	In cases of need the officer-in-charge of the navigational watch shall not hesitate to use the helm, engines and sound signalling apparatus. However, timely notice of intended variations of engine speed shall be given where possible or effective use made of UMS engine controls provided on the bridge in accordance with the applicable procedures.

30.	Officers of the navigational watch shall know the handling characteristics of their ship, including its stopping distances, and should appreciate that other ships may have different handling characteristics.

31.	A proper record shall be kept during the watch of the movements and activities relating to the navigation of the ship.

32.	It is of special importance that at all times the officer in charge of the navigational watch ensures that a proper look-out is maintained. In a ship with a separate chart room the officer-in-charge of the navigational watch may visit the chart room, when essential, for a short period for the necessary performance of navigational duties, but shall first ensure that it is safe to do so and that proper look-out is maintained.

33.	Operational tests of shipboard navigational equipment shall be carried out at sea as frequently as practicable and as circumstances permit, in particular before hazardous conditions affecting navigation are expected. Whenever appropriate, these tests shall be recorded. Such tests shall also be carried out prior to port arrival and departure.

34.	The officer-in-charge of the navigational watch shall make regular checks to ensure that—

(1)	the person steering the ship or the automatic pilot is steering the correct course;

(2)	the standard compass error is determined at least once a watch and, when possible, after any major alteration of course; the standard and gyro-compasses are frequently compared and repeaters are synchronized with their master compass;

(3)	the automatic pilot is tested manually at least once a watch;

(4)	the navigation and signal lights and other navigational equipment are functioning properly;

(5)	the radio equipment is functioning properly in accordance with paragraph 86 of this section; and

39.	Whenever radar is in use, the officer-in-charge of the navigational watch shall select an appro-priate range scale and observe the display carefully, and shall ensure that plotting or systematic analysis is commenced in ample time.

40.	The officer-in-charge of the navigational watch shall notify the master immediately—

(1)	if restricted visibility is encountered or expected;

(2)	if the traffic conditions or the movements of other ships are causing concern;

(3)	if difficulty is experienced in maintaining course;

(4)	on failure to sight land, a navigation mark or to obtain soundings by the expected time;

(5)	if, unexpectedly, land or a navigation mark is sighted or a change in soundings occurs;

(6)	on breakdown of the engines, propulsion machinery remote control, steering gear or any essential navigational equipment, alarm or indicator;

(7)	if the radio equipment malfunctions;

(8)	in heavy weather, if in any doubt about the possibility of weather damage;

(9)	if the ship meets any hazard to navigation, such as ice or a derelict; and

(10)	in any other emergency or if in any doubt.

41.	Despite the requirement to notify the master immediately in the foregoing circumstances, the officer-in-charge of the navigational watch shall in addition not hesitate to take immediate action for the safety of the ship, where circumstances so require.

42.	The officer-in-charge of the navigational watch shall give watchkeeping personnel all appropriate instructions and information which will ensure the keeping of a safe watch, including a proper lookout.

Watchkeeping under different conditions and in different areas

43.	Clear weather.—The officer-in-charge of the navigational watch shall take frequent and accurate compass bearings of approaching ships as a means of early detection of risk of collision and bear in mind that such risk may sometimes exist even when an appreciable bearing change is evident, particularly when approaching a very large ship or a tow or when approaching a ship at close range. The offi- cer-in-charge of the navigational watch shall also take early and positive action in compliance with the applicable International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 and subsequently check that such action is having the desired effect.

44.	In clear weather, whenever possible, the officer-in-charge of the navigational watch shall carry out radar practice.

ANNEX 9—continued

45.	Restricted visibility.—When restricted visibility is encountered or expected, the first responsi-bility of the officer-in-charge of the navigational watch is to comply with the relevant rules of the Inter-national Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 with particular regard to the sounding of fog signals, proceeding at a safe speed and having the engines ready for immediate manoeuvre. In addition, the officer-in-charge of the navigational watch shall—

(1)	inform the master;

(3)	exhibit navigation lights; and

(4)	operate and use the radar.

46.	In hours of darkness.—The master and the officer-in-charge of the navigational watch when ar-ranging look-out duty shall have due regard to the bridge equipment and navigational aids available for use, their limitations; procedures and safeguards implemented.

47.	Coastal and congested waters.—The largest scale chart on board, suitable for the area and cor-rected with the latest available information, shall be used. Fixes shall be taken at frequent intervals, and shall be carried out by more than one method whenever circumstances allow.

48.	The officer-in-charge of the navigational watch shall positively identify all relevant navigation marks.

49.	Navigation with pilot on board.—Despite the duties and obligations of pilots, their presence on board does not relieve the master or officer-in-charge of the navigational watch from their duties and obligations for the safely of the ship. The master and the pilot shall exchange information regarding navigation procedures, local conditions and the ship’s characteristics. The master and/or the officer-in- charge of the navigational watch shall co-operate closely with the pilot and maintain an accurate check on the ship’s position and movement.

50.	If in any doubt as to the pilot’s actions or intentions, the officer-in-charge of the navigational watch shall seek clarification from the pilot and, if doubt still exists, shall notify the master immediately and take whatever action *is necessary before the master arrives.

51.	Ship at anchor.—If the master considers it necessary, a continuous navigational watch shall be maintained at anchor. While at anchor, the officer-in-charge of the navigational watch shall—

(1)	determine and plot the ship’s position on the appropriate chart as soon as practicable;

(2)	when circumstances permit, check at sufficiently frequent intervals whether the ship is remaining securely at anchor by taking bearings of fixed navigation marks or readily identifiable shore objects;

(3)	ensure that proper look-out is maintained;

(4)	ensure that inspection rounds of the ship are made periodically;

(5)	observe meteorological and tidal conditions and the state of the sea;

(6)	notify the master and undertake all necessary measures if the ship drags anchor;

(7)	ensure that the state of readiness of the main engines and other machinery is in accor-dance with the master’s instructions;

(8)	if visibility deteriorates, notify the master;

(9)	ensure that the ship exhibits the appropriate lights and shapes and that appropriate sound signals are made in accordance with all applicable regulations; and

60.	The officer-in-charge of the engineering watch shall continue to be responsible for machinery- space operations, despite the presence of the chief engineer officer in the machinery spaces, until spe-cifically informed that the chief engineer officer has assumed that responsibility and this is mutually understood.

61.	All members of the engineering watch shall be familiar with their assigned watchkeeping duties. In addition, every member shall with respect to the ship they are serving in have knowledge of—

(1)	the use of appropriate internal communication systems;

(2)	the escape routes from machinery spaces;

(3)	the engine-room alarm systems and be able to distinguish between the various alarms with special reference to the fire extinguishing media alarm; and

(4)	the number location and types of fire-fighting equipment and damage control gear in the machinery spaces, together with their use and the various safety precautions to be observed.

62.	Any machinery not functioning properly, expected to malfunction or requiring special service, shall be noted along with any action already taken. Plans shall be made for any further action if required.

63.	When the machinery spaces are in the manned condition, the officer-in-charge of the engineering watch shall at all times be readily capable of operating the propulsion equipment in response to needs for changes in direction or speed. 

ANNEX 9—continued

64.	When the machinery spaces are in the periodic unmanned condition, the designated duty officer-in-charge of the engineering watch shall be immediately available and on call to attend the machinery spaces.

65.	All bridge orders shall be promptly executed. Changes in direction or speed of the main propul-sion units shall be recorded, except where an Administration has determined that the size or characteris-tics of a particular ship make such recording impracticable. The officer-in-charge of the engineering watch shall ensure that the main propulsion unit controls, when in the manual mode of operation, are continuously attended under stand-by or manoeuvring conditions.

66.	Due attention shall be paid to the ongoing maintenance and support of all machinery, including mechanical, electrical, electronic, hydraulic and pneumatic systems, their control apparatus and associated safety equipment, all accommodation Service systems equipment and the recording of stores and spare gear usage.

67.	The chief engineer officer shall ensure that the officer-in-charge of the engineering watch is in-formed of all preventive maintenance, damage control, or repair operations to be performed during the engineering watch. The officer-in-charge of the engineering watch shall be responsible for the isolation, by-passing and adjustment of all machinery under the responsibility of the engineering watch that is to be worked on, and shall record all work carried out.

68.	When the engine-room is put in a stand-by condition, the officer-in-charge of the engineering watch shall ensure that all machinery and equipment which may be used during manoeuvring is in a state of immediate readiness and that an adequate reserve of power is available for steering gear and other requirements.

69.	Officers in charge of an engineering watch shall not be assigned or undertake any duties which would interfere with their supervisory duties in respect of the main propulsion system and ancillary equipment. They shall keep the main propulsion plant and auxiliary systems under constant supervision until properly relieved, and shall periodically inspect the machinery in their charge. They shall also ensure that adequate rounds of the machinery and steering gear spaces are made for the purpose of observing and reporting equipment malfunctions or breakdowns, performing or directing routine adjustments, required upkeep and any other necessary tasks.

70.	Officers in charge of an engineering watch shall direct any other member of the engineering watch to inform them of potentially hazardous conditions which may adversely affect the machinery or jeopardize the safety of life or of the ship.

71.	The officer-in-charge of the engineering watch shall ensure that the machinery space watch is supervised, and shall arrange for substitute personnel in the event of the incapacity of any engineering watch personnel. The engineering watch shall not leave the machinery spaces unsupervised in a manner that would prevent the manual operation of the engine-room plant or throttles.

72.	The officer-in-charge of the engineering watch shall take the action necessary to contain the ef-fects of damage resulting from equipment breakdown, fire, flooding, rupture, collision, stranding, or other cause.

73.	Before going off duty, the officer-in-charge of the engineering watch shall ensure that all events related to the main and auxiliary machinery which have occurred during the engineering watch are suitably recorded.

74.	The officer-in-charge of the engineering watch shall co-operate with any engineer in charge of maintenance work during all preventive maintenance, damage control or repairs. This shall include but not necessarily be limited to—

(1) isolating and bypassing machinery to be worked on;

ANNEX 9—continued

(2)	adjusting the remaining plant to function adequately and safely during the maintenance period;

(3)	recording, in the engine-room log or other suitable document, the equipment worked on and the personnel involved, and which safety steps have been taken and by whom, for the benefit of relieving officers and for record purposes; and

(4)	testing and putting into service, when necessary, the repaired machinery or equipment.

75.	The officer-in-charge of the engineering watch shall ensure that any engine-room ratings who perform maintenance duties are available to assist in the manual operation of machinery in the event of automatic equipment failure.

76.	The officer-in-charge of the engineering watch shall bear in mind that changes in speed, resulting from machinery malfunction, or any loss of steering, may imperil the safety of the ship and life at sea. The bridge shall be immediately notified, in the event of fire, and of any impending action in machinery spaces that may cause reduction in the ship’s speed, imminent steering failure, stoppage of the ship’s propulsion system or any alteration in the generation of electric power or similar threat to safety. This notification, where possible, shall be accomplished before changes are made, in order to afford the bridge the maximum available time to take whatever action is possible to avoid a potential marine casualty.

77.	The officer-in-charge of the engineering watch shall notify the chief engineer officer without delay—

(1)	when engine damage or a malfunction occurs which may be such as to endanger the safe operation of the ship;

(2)	when any malfunction occurs which, it is believed, may cause damage or breakdown of propulsion machinery, auxiliary machinery or monitoring and governing systems; and

(3)	in any emergency or if in any doubt as to what decision or measures to take.

78.	Despite the requirement to notify the chief engineer officer in the foregoing circumstances, the officer-in-charge of the engineering watch shall not hesitate to take immediate action for the safety of the ship, its machinery and crew where circumstances require.

79.	The officer-in-charge of the engineering watch shall give the watchkeeping personnel all ap-propriate instructions and information which will ensure the keeping of a safe engineering watch. Routine machinery upkeep, performed as incidental tasks as a part of keeping a safe watch, shall be set up as an integral part of the watch routine. Detailed repair maintenance involving repairs to electrical, mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic or applicable electronic equipment throughout the ship shall be performed with the cognisance of the officer-in-charge of the engineering watch and chief engineer officer. These repairs shall be recorded.

ENGINEERING WATCHKEEPING UNDER DIFFERENT CONDITIONS

AND IN DIFFERENT AREAS

80.	Restricted visibility.—The officer-in-charge of the engineering watch shall ensure that permanent air or steam pressure is available for sound signals and that at all times bridge orders relating to changes in speed or direction of operation are immediately implemented and, in addition, that auxiliary machinery used for manoeuvring is readily available.

81.	Coastal and congested waters.—The officer-in-charge of the engineering watch shall ensure that all machinery involved with the manoeuvring of the ship can immediately be placed in the manual mode of operation when notified that the ship is in congested waters. The officer-in-charge of the

ANNEX 9—continued

engineering watch shall also ensure that an adequate reserve of power is available for steering and other manoeuvring requirements. Emergency steering and other auxiliary equipment shall be ready for immediate operation.

82.	Ship at anchor.—At an unsheltered anchorage the chief engineer officer shall consult with the master whether or not to maintain the same engineering watch as when underway.

83.	When a ship is at anchor in an open roadstead or any other virtually 'at sea' condition, the en-gineer officer-in-charge of the engineering watch shall ensure that—

(1)	an efficient engineering watch is kept;

(2)	periodic inspection is made of all operating and stand-by machinery;

(3)	main and auxiliary machinery is maintained in a state of readiness in accordance with orders from the bridge;
