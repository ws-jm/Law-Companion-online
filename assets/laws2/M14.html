[Cap. 123.]

3.	Power of delegation

(1)	Where by any law enacted by the National Assembly or taking effect as if it had been so enacted, a Minister is empowered to exercise any powers or perform any duties, he may by a delegation notified in the Federal Gazette depute any of the following officers by name or office to exercise those powers or perform those duties, subject to such conditions, exceptions and qualifications as the Minister may prescribe—

4.	Signification of acts of Minister

When any power is given to a Minister to make any declaration or appointment or to give any licence, authorisation, exemption, notice, direction, approval, permission or consent, it shall be sufficient, unless it be otherwise expressed, for the same to be signified under the hand of the Permanent Secretary having supervision over a department of government with which that Minister has been charged with responsibility; the signification of the exercise of the power shall be sufficient evidence that all necessary consents have been obtained, unless the contrary is proved.

5.	Saving of existing delegations

In respect of any power or duty vested in the President prior to the making of any order under section 2 of this Act, any delegation of such power shall remain in full force and effect until revoked or repealed by the Minister to whom the power or duty is transferred, but the continuance of such a delegation shall not prevent the exercise by such Minister of any such power or duty made and in operation immediately before 20 January 1964 (being the date of the commencement of the Interpretation Act) and notwithstanding the repeal of the authority under which the delegation was made.
