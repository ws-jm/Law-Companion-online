The registrar shall then issue his certificate and the marriage may proceed as if the caveat had not been entered, but the time that has elapsed between the entering and the removal of the caveat shall not be computed in the period of three months specified in sections 11 and 12 of this Act.

[No. 58 of 1933 and L.N. 47 of 1955.]
