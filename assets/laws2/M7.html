PARTI

Jurisdiction

1.	Institution of matrimonial cause proceedings only under this Act

(1)	After the commencement of this Act, a matrimonial cause shall not be instituted otherwise than under this Act.

(2)	If a matrimonial cause has been instituted before the commencement of this Act but not com-pleted, it shall be continued and dealt with only in accordance with the provisions of this Act.

(3)	Where before or after the commencement of this Act a matrimonial cause has been or is instituted, and whether or not it has been completed, proceedings in relation thereto for any relief or order of a kind that could be sought under this Act shall be instituted after the commencement of this Act only under this Act, so however that, subject to the succeeding provisions of this and the next section—

(a)	any jurisdiction of a court of summary jurisdiction of a State or of a court of appeal from such a court, under the law of that State, to make—

(i)	orders with respect to the maintenance of wives or children or the custody of or access to children; or

(ii)	separation orders or other orders having the effect of relieving a party to a marriage from any obligation to cohabit with the other party,

shall not be affected by this Act or any proceedings thereunder; and

(b)	proceedings for or in respect of such an order, or for its enforcement, may be continued or instituted as if this Act had not been made.

(4)	Where a marriage is dissolved or annulled by a decree of a court of competent jurisdiction under this Act—

(a)	any jurisdiction of such a court or of a court on appeal from such a court, to make orders of the kind specified in subsection (3) (a) of this section shall, by virtue of this subsection, cease to be applicable in relation to the parties to the marriage or the children of the marriage; and

(b)	any order of that kind (unless it is a maintenance order, when subsection (6) of this section will apply) made by such a court in relation to those parties or children shall cease to have effect.

(5)	A court in the exercise of its jurisdiction under this Act may at any time by order direct that an order of the kind specified in subsection (3) (a) of this section made by a court of summary jurisdiction, or by a court on appeal from such a court, shall cease to have effect; and that order shall cease to have effect accordingly.

(6)	Where an order of the kind specified in subsection (3) (a) of this section made with respect to the maintenance of a wife or of children ceases to have effect under subsection (4) or (5) of this section, the order made may, in so far as it relates to any period before it so ceased to have effect, be enforced as if this Act had not been made.

2.	Jurisdiction in matrimonial causes

(1)	Subject to this Act, a person may institute a matrimonial cause under this Act in the High Court of any State of the Federation; and for that purpose the High Court of each State of the Federation shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine—

(a)	matrimonial causes instituted under this Act; and

(b)	matrimonial causes (not being matrimonial causes to which section 101 of this Act applies) continued in accordance with the provisions of Part IX of this Act, so however that jurisdiction under this Act in respect of matrimonial causes within this paragraph shall be restricted to the court in which the matrimonial cause was instituted,

and in any case where maintenance is ordered in proceedings in a High Court, a court of summary ju-risdiction in any State shall have jurisdiction to enforce payment in summary manner.

(2)	Proceedings for a decree—

(a)	of dissolution of marriage; or

(b)	of nullity of a voidable marriage; or

(ic)	of nullity of a void marriage; or

(d)	of judicial separation; or

may be instituted under this Act only by a person domiciled in Nigeria.

3.	Void marriages and prohibited degrees of consanguinity

(b)	the parties are within the prohibited degrees of consanguinity or, subject to section 4 of this Act, of affinity;

(ii)	that party is mistaken as to identity of the other party, or as to the nature of the cere-mony performed;

4.	Marriage of persons within prohibited degrees of affinity

(1)	Where two persons who are within the prohibited degrees of affinity wish to marry each other, they may apply, in writing, to a judge for permission to do so.

(2)	If the judge is satisfied that the circumstances of the particular case are so exceptional as to jus-tify the granting of the permission sought he may, by order, permit the applicants to marry one another.

(3)	Where persons marry in pursuance of permission granted under this section, the validity of their marriage shall not be affected by the fact that they are within the prohibited degrees of affinity.

(4)	The President may arrange with the Governor of a State for the performance by judges of the High Court of that State of functions under this section.

(5)	In this section, 'judge' means a judge in respect of whom an arrangement made under subsection (4) of this section is applicable.

5.	Voidable marriage

(1)	Subject to this Act, a marriage that takes place after the commencement of this Act not being a marriage that is void, shall be voidable in the following cases but not otherwise, that is to say, where at the time of marriage—

(2)	For the purposes of this section, 'mental defective' means a person who, owing to an arrested or incomplete development of mind, whether arising from inherent causes or induced by disease or injury, requires oversight, care or control for his own protection or for the protection of others and is, by reason of that fact, unfitted for the responsibilities of marriage.

6.	Validity, etc., of certain marriages not affected

(1)	Save as expressly provided in this Part of this Act, nothing in this Part shall affect the validity or invalidity of a marriage that took place before the commencement of this Act.

(2)	A provision of this Act shall not affect the validity or invalidity of a marriage where it would not be in accordance with the rules of private international law to apply that provision in relation to that marriage.

8.	Law to be applied

The jurisdiction conferred on a court by this Act shall be exercised in accordance with this Act, and any law in force immediately before the commencement of this Act which confers jurisdiction in divorce or matrimonial causes on the High Court of a State or provides for the law and practice to be applied in the exercise of that jurisdiction shall, to the extent that it does so, cease to have effect.

9.	Staying and transferring of proceedings

(1)	Where it appears to a court in which a matrimonial cause has been instituted under this Act that a matrimonial cause between the parties to the marriage or purported marriage has been instituted in another court having jurisdiction under this Act, the court may in its discretion stay the matrimonial cause for such time as it thinks fit.

(2)	Where it appears to a court in which matrimonial cause has been instituted under this Act (in-cluding a matrimonial cause in relation to which subsection (1) of this section applies) that it is in the interest of justice that the matrimonial cause be dealt with in another court having jurisdiction to hear and determine that cause, the court may transfer the matrimonial cause to the other court.

(3)	The court may exercise its powers under this section at any time and at any stage either on ap-plication by any of the parties, or of its own motion.

Matrimonial relief

Reconciliation

11.	Reconciliation

(1)	It shall be the duty of the court in which a matrimonial cause has been instituted to give consid-eration, from time to time, to the possibility of a reconciliation of the parties to the marriage (unless the proceedings are of such a nature that it would not be appropriate to do so), and if at any time it appears to the judge constituting the court, either from the nature of the case, the evidence in the proceedings or the attitude of those parties, or of either of them, or of counsel, that there is a reasonable possibility of such a reconciliation, the judge may do all or any of the following, that is to say, he may—

(a)	adjourn the proceedings to afford those parties an opportunity of becoming reconciled or to enable anything to be done in accordance with either of the next two succeeding paragraphs;

(b)	with the consent of those parties, interview them in chambers, with or without counsel, as the judge thinks proper, with a view to effecting a reconciliation;

(c)	nominate a person with experience or training in marriage conciliation, or in special circum-stances, some other suitable person, to endeavour with the consent of the parties, to effect a reconciliation.

(2)	If, not less than fourteen days after an adjournment under subsection (1) of this section has taken place, either of the parties to the marriage requests that the hearing be proceeded with, the judge shall resume the hearing, or the proceedings may be dealt with by another judge, as the case may require, as soon as practicable.

12.	Hearing when reconciliation fails

Where a judge has acted as conciliator under section 11 (1) (b) of this Act but the attempt to effect a reconciliation has failed, the judge shall not, except at the request of the parties to the proceedings, con-tinue to hear the proceedings, or determine the proceedings; and, in the absence of such a request, the proceedings shall be dealt with by another judge.

13.	Statements, etc., made in course of attempt to effect reconciliation

Evidence of anything said or of any admission made in the course of an endeavour to effect a recon-ciliation under this Part of this Act shall not be admissible in any court (whether exercising federal ju-risdiction or not) or in proceedings before a person authorised by any enactment, federal or state, or by consent of parties, to hear, receive and examine evidence.

14.	Marriage conciliator to take oath of secrecy

A marriage conciliator shall, before entering upon the performance of his functions as such a con-ciliator, make and subscribe, before a person authorised in Nigeria to take affidavits, an oath or affirmation of secrecy in accordance with the form in the Second Schedule to this Act.

[Second Schedule.]

Dissolution of marriage

15.	Grounds for dissolution of marriage

(1)	A petition under this Act by a party to a marriage for a decree of dissolution of the marriage may be presented to the court by either party to the marriage upon the ground that the marriage has broken down irretrievably. 

(2)	The court hearing a petition for a decree of dissolution of a marriage shall hold the marriage to have broken down irretrievably if, but only if, the petitioner satisfies the court of one or more of the following facts—

(а)	that the respondent has wilfully and persistently refused to consummate the marriage;

(б)	that since the marriage the respondent has committed adultery and the petitioner finds it in-tolerable to live with the respondent;

(c)	that since the marriage the respondent has behaved in such a way that the petitioner cannot reasonably be expected to live with the respondent;

(d)	that the respondent has deserted the petitioner for a continuous period of at least one year immediately preceding the presentation of the petition;

(e)	that the parties to the marriage have lived apart for a continuous period of at least two years immediately preceding the presentation of the petition and the respondent does not object to a decree being granted;

(/) that the parties to the marriage have lived apart for a continuous period of a least three years immediately preceding the presentation of the petition;

(g)	that the other party to the marriage has, for a period of not less than one year, failed to comply with a decree or restitution of conjugal rights made under his Act;

(h)	that the other party to the marriage has been absent from the petitioner for such time and in such circumstances as to provide reasonable grounds for presuming that he or she is dead.

(3)	For the purposes of subsection (2) (e) and (/) of this section the parties to a marriage shall be treated as living apart unless they are living with each other in the same household.

16.	Provisions supplementary to section 15

(1)	Without prejudice to the generality of section 15 (2) of this Act, the court hearing a petition for a decree of dissolution of marriage shall hold that the petitioner has satisfied the court of the fact mentioned in the said section 15 (2) (c) of this Act if the petitioner satisfies the court that—

(a)	since the marriage, the respondent has committed rape, sodomy, or bestiality; or

(b)	since the marriage, the respondent has, for a period of not less than two years—

(i)	been a habitual drunkard; or

(ii)	habitually been intoxicated by reason of taking or using to excess any sedative, narcotic or stimulating drug or preparation,

or has, for a part or parts of such a period, been a habitual drunkard and has, for the other

part or parts of the period, habitually been so intoxicated; or

(c)	since the marriage, the respondent has within a period not exceeding five years—

(i)	suffered frequent convictions for crime in respect of which the respondent has been sentenced in the aggregate to imprisonment for not less than three years; and

(ii)	habitually left the petitioner without reasonable means of support; or

(d)	since the marriage, the respondent has been in prison for a period of not less than three years after conviction for an offence punishable by death or imprisonment for life or for a period of five years or more, and is still in prison at the date of the petition; or

(e)	since the marriage and within a period of one year immediately preceding the date of the petition, the respondent has been convicted of—

(i)	having attempted to murder or unlawfully to kill the petitioner; or

(ii)	having committed an offence involving the intentional infliction of grievous harm or grievous hurt on the petitioner or the intent to inflict grievous harm or grievous hurt on the petitioner; or

(/) the respondent has habitually and wilfully failed, throughout the period of two years immediately preceding the date of the petition, to pay maintenance for the petitioner—

(i)	ordered to be paid under an order of, or an order registered in, a court in the Federation; or

(ii)	agreed to be paid under an agreement between the parties to the marriage providing for their separation; or

(g)	the respondent—

(i)	is, at the date of the petition, of unsound mind and unlikely to recover; and

(ii)	since the marriage and within the period of six years immediately preceding the date of the petition, has been confined for a period of, or for periods aggregating, not less than five years in an institution where persons may be confined for unsoundness of mind in accordance with law, or in more than one such institution.

(2)	Where a petition is based on the fact mentioned in section 15 (2) (h) of this Act—

(a)	proof that, for a period of seven years immediately preceding the date of the petition, the other party to the marriage was continually absent from the petitioner and that the petitioner has no reason to believe that the other party was alive at any time within that period, is sufficient to establish the fact in question, unless it is shown that the other party to the marriage was alive at a time within that period; and

(b)	a decree made pursuant to the petition shall be in the form of a decree of dissolution of marriage by reason of presumption of death.

17.	Additional provisions to encourage reconciliation

(1)	Where the petitioner alleges that the respondent has behaved in such a way that the petitioner cannot reasonably be expected to live with him but the parties to the marriage have lived with each other for a period or periods after the date of the occurrence of the final incident relied on by the petitioner and held by the court to support his allegation, that fact shall be disregarded in determining for the purposes of section 15 (2) (c) of this Act whether the petitioner cannot reasonably be expected to live with the respondent if the length of that period or of those periods together was six months or less.

(2)	In considering for the purposes of section 15 (2) of this Act whether the period for which the re-spondent has deserted the petitioner or the period for which the parties to a marriage have lived apart has been continuous, no account shall be taken of any one period (not exceeding six months) or of any two or more periods (not exceeding six months in all) during which the parties resumed living with each other, but no period during which the parties lived with each other shall count as part of the period of desertion or of the period for which the parties to the marriage lived apart, as the case may be.

(3)	References in this section to the parties to a marriage living with each other shall be construed as references to their living with each other in the same household.

18.	Constructive desertion

A married person whose conduct constitutes just cause or excuse for the other party to the marriage to live separately or apart, and occasions that other party to live separately or apart, shall be deemed to have wilfully deserted that other party without just cause or excuse, notwithstanding that that person may not in fact have intended the conduct to occasion that other party to live separately or apart.

19.	Refusal to resume cohabitation

(1)	Where husband and wife are parties to an agreement for separation, whether oral, in writing or constituted by conduct, the refusal by one of them, without reasonable justification, to comply with the other’s bona fide request to resume cohabitation shall constitute, as from the date of the refusal, wilful desertion without just cause or excuse on the part of the party so refusing.

(2)	For the purposes of this section, 'reasonable justification' means justification that is reasonable in all the circumstances, including the conduct of the other party to the marriage since the marriage, whether that conduct took place before or after the agreement for separation.

20.	Desertion continuing after insanity

Where a party to a marriage has been wilfully deserted by the other party, the desertion shall not be deemed to have been terminated by reason only that the deserting party has become incapable of forming or having an intention to continue the desertion, if it appears to the court that the desertion would probably have continued if the deserting party had not become so incapable.

21.	Restriction on finding of non-consummation

The court shall not find that a respondent has wilfully and persistently refused to consummate the marriage unless the court is satisfied that, as at the commencement of the hearing of the petition, the marriage had not been consummated.

22.	Aggregation of concurrent sentences in reckoning imprisonment

Where—

(a)	a person has been sentenced to imprisonment in respect of each of two or more crimes that, in the opinion of the court hearing the petition, arose substantially out of the same acts or omissions; and

(b)	the sentences were ordered to be served, in whole or in part, concurrently,

then in reckoning for the purposes of section 16 (1) (c) of this Act the period for which that person has been sentenced in the aggregate, any period during which two or more of those sentences were to be served concurrently shall be taken into account once only.

23.	Restriction on finding of non-maintenance

A finding in accordance with section 16 (1) (J) of this Act shall not be made unless the court is satis-fied that reasonable attempts have been made by the petitioner to enforce the order or agreement under which maintenance was ordered or agreed to be paid.

24.	Restriction on finding of insanity

A finding in accordance with section 16 (1) (g) of this Act shall not be made unless the court is sat-isfied that, at the commencement of the hearing of the petition, the respondent was still confined in an institution referred to in the said section 16 (1) (g) and was unlikely to recover.

25.	Power to refuse to make decree without maintenance, etc., in proper case

On the application of the respondent made in the course of proceedings for a decree of dissolution of marriage, the court may, if it considers it just and proper in the circumstances of the case to make provision for the maintenance of the respondent or other provision for the benefit of the respondent, refuse to make a decree unless and until it is satisfied that the petitioner has made arrangements satisfactory to the court to provide the maintenance of other benefit as aforesaid upon the decree becoming absolute.

26.	Condonation and connivance

Except where section 16 (1) (g) of this Act applies, a decree of dissolution of marriage shall not be made if the petitioner has condoned or connived at the conduct constituting the facts on which the peti-tion is based.

27.	Collusion

A decree of dissolution of marriage shall not be made if the petitioner, in bringing or prosecuting the proceedings, has been guilty of collusion with intent to cause a perversion of justice.

28.	Discretionary bars

The court may, in its discretion, refuse to make a decree of marriage if since the marriage—

(a)	the petitioner has committed adultery that has not been condoned by the respondent or, hav-ing been so condoned, has been revived;

(b)	the petitioner has wilfully deserted the respondent before the happening of the matters relied upon by the petitioner or, where those matters involve other matters occurring during, or ex-tending over, a period, before the expiration of that period; or

(c)	the habits of the petitioner have, or the conduct of the petitioner has, conduced or contributed to the existence of the matters relied upon by the petitioner.

29.	No dissolution where petition for nullity before court

Where both a petition for a decree of nullity of a marriage and a petition for a decree of dissolution of that marriage are before a court, the court shall not make a decree of dissolution of the marriage unless it has dismissed the petition for a decree of nullity of the marriage.

30.	Petition within two years of marriage

(1)	Subject to this section, proceedings for a decree of dissolution of marriage shall not be instituted within two years after the date of the marriage except by leave of the court.

(2)	Nothing in this section shall apply to the institution of proceedings based on any of the matters specified in section 15 (2) (a) or (6) or 16 (1) (a) of this Act, or to the institution of proceedings for a decree of dissolution of marriage by way of cross-proceedings.

(3)	The court shall not grant leave under this section to institute proceedings except on the ground that to refuse to grant the leave would impose exceptional hardship on the applicant or that the case is one involving exceptional depravity on the part of the other party to the marriage.

(4)	In determining an application for leave to institute proceedings under this section, the court shall have regard to the interest of any children of the marriage, and to the question whether there is any reasonable probability of a reconciliation between the parties before the expiration of the period of two years after the date of the marriage.

(5)	Where, at the hearing of proceedings that have been instituted by leave of the court under this section, the court is satisfied that the leave was obtained by misrepresentation or concealment of material facts, the court may—

(c)	a reference to costs incurred in proceedings relating to a maintenance order shall be read, in the case of a maintenance order made by the High Court of a State, as a reference to such costs as are included in an order for costs relating solely to that maintenance order.

3.	Subject to this Schedule, a person entitled to receive payments under a maintenance order may apply to—

(a)	the court that made the order; or

(b)	the court in which the order is for the time being registered under section 89 or 91 of this Act, for an attachment of earnings order.

5.	The court shall not make an attachment or earnings order if it appears to the court, in a case to which paragraph 4 (a) above applies, that the failure of the defendant to make payments under the maintenance order was not due to his wilful refusal or culpable neglect.

6.	An attachment of earnings order shall specify the normal deduction rate, that is to say, the rate at which the court considers it to be reasonable that the earnings to which the order relates should be applied in satisfying the requirements of the maintenance order but not exceeding the rate that appears to the court to be necessary for the purpose of—

(b)	securing payment within a reasonable time of any sums already due and unpaid under the maintenance order and any costs incurred in proceedings relating to the maintenance order that are payable by the defendant.

7.	An attachment of earnings order shall also specify the protected earnings rate, that is to say, the rate below which, having regard to the resources and needs of the defendant and of any person for whom he must or reasonably may provide, the court considers it to be reasonable that the net earnings of the defendant should not be reduced by a payment under the order.

8.	An attachment of earnings order shall provide that payments under the order are to be made to an officer of the court specified in the order.

9.	An attachment of earnings order shall contain such particulars as the court thinks proper for the purpose of enabling the person to whom the order is directed to identify the defendant.

pay, so far as that excess permits, to the officer specified for the purpose in the order both the normal deduction and so much of the normal deduction for the purpose of any previous pay-day as was not paid on that pay-day and has not been paid on any other previous pay-day.

12.	A payment made by the employer under the last preceding paragraph is a valid discharge to him as against the defendant to the extent of the amount paid.

13.	Where proceedings for attachments are brought in a court under section 88 of this Act, or where pro-ceedings are taken in a court of summary jurisdiction to enforce an order registered in that court under section 91 of this Act, the court may, instead of making any other order, make an attachment of earnings order.

14.	Where an attachment of earnings order has been made, no writ, order or warrant of commitment or at-tachment shall be issued or made in proceedings for the enforcement of the maintenance order that were begun before the making of the attachment of earnings order.

15.	The court by which an attachment of earnings order has been made may in its discretion, on the application of the defendant or a person entitled to receive payments under the maintenance order, make an order discharging or varying the attachment of earnings order.

17.	An attachment of earnings order ceases to have effect—

(a)	upon the issuing or making of a writ, order or warrant of commitment or attachment for the enforcement of the maintenance order in relation to which the attachment of earnings order applies; or

(b)	subject to the next succeeding paragraph, upon the discharge or variation of that maintenance order.

18.	Where it appears to the court discharging a maintenance order that arrears under the order will remain to be recovered under the order, the court may in its discretion direct that the attachment of earnings order shall not cease to have effect until those arrears have been paid.

19.	Where an attachment of earnings order ceases to have effect, the proper officer of the court by which the order was made shall forthwith give notice accordingly to the person to whom the order was directed.

20.	Where an attachment of earnings order ceases to have effect or is discharged, the person to whom the attachment of earnings order is directed does not incur any liability in consequence of his treating the order as still in force at any time before the expiration of seven days after the date on which the notice required by the last preceding paragraph or a copy of the discharging order, as the case may be, is served on him.

21.	A person to whom an attachment of earnings order is directed shall, notwithstanding anything in any other law, but subject to this Schedule, comply with the order or, if the order is varied, with the order as varied.

22.	Where, on any occasion on which earnings become payable to a defendant there are in force two or more attachment of earnings orders in relation to those earnings, the person to whom the orders are directed—

(ia) shall comply with those orders according to the respective dates on which they came into force and shall disregard any order until an earlier order has been complied with; and

(b) shall comply with any order as if the earnings to which the order relates were the residue of the defendant’s earnings after the making of any payment under any earlier order.

23.	A person who makes a payment in compliance with an attachment of earnings order shall give to the defendant a notice specifying particulars of the payment.

24.	A person to whom an attachment of earnings order is directed who, at the time when a copy of the order is served on him or at any time after the time, has not on any occasion during the period of four weeks immediately preceding that time been the defendant’s employer, shall forthwith give notice in writing accordingly to the proper officer of the court that made the order.

25.	Where proceedings relating to an attachment of earnings order are brought in any court, the court may, either before or after the hearing—

(a)	order the defendant to furnish to the court, within a specified period, a statement signed by the defendant specifying—

(i)	the name and address of his employer or, if he has more employers than one, of each of his employers;

(ii)	particulars as to the defendant’s earnings; and

(iii)	such particulars as are necessary to enable the defendant to be identified by any of his employers; and

(b)	order any person who appears to the court to be an employer of the defendant to give to the court, within a specified period, a statement signed by him or on his behalf, containing such particulars as are specified in the order of all earnings of the defendant that became payable by the person during a specified period.

26.	A document purporting to be a statement referred to in the last preceding paragraph shall, in any pro-ceedings relating to an attachment of earnings order, be received in evidence and shall, unless the contrary is shown, be presumed without further proof to be such a statement.

27.	The court by which an attachment of earnings order has been made shall, on the application of the person to whom the order is directed or of the defendant or of the person in whose favour the order was made, determine whether payments to the defendant of a particular class or description specified in the application are earnings for the purposes of that order.

28.	(1) A person to whom an attachment of earnings order is directed who makes an application under paragraph 27 above shall not incur any liability for failing to comply with the order with respect to any payments of the class or description specified in the application that are made by him to the defendant while the application, or any appeal from a determination made on the application, is pending.

(2) The foregoing sub-paragraph shall not apply in respect of any payment made after the application has been withdrawn or any appeal from a determination made on the application has been abandoned.

29.	The officer to whom an employer pays any sum in pursuance of an attachment of earnings order shall pay that sum to such person entitled to receive payments under the maintenance order as is specified by the attachment of earnings order.

30.	Any sum received by virtue of an attachment of earnings order by the person entitled to receive shall be deemed to be a payment made by the defendant to that person, so as to discharge first any sum due and unpaid under the maintenance order (a sum due at an earlier date being discharged before a sum due at a later date) and secondly any costs incurred in proceedings relating to the maintenance order that were payable by the defendant when the attachment of earnings order was made or last varied.

31.	On any occasion on which an employer makes a payment under this Schedule in respect of a defendant, the employer may retain for his own use out of any balance of the defendant’s earnings remaining after the making of that payment the sum of five kobo or, if on that occasion the employer makes payments in pursuance of two or more attachment of earnings order relating to the defendant, the sum of five kobo in respect of each such payment.

32.	(1) Any person who—

(a)	fails to comply with any requirement of this Schedule, or of an order under this Schedule, that is applicable to him; or

(b)	in any statement of notice furnished to a court under this Schedule or in compliance with an order made under this Schedule, makes a statement that he knows to be false or misleading in a material particular; or

(c)	recklessly furnishes such a statement or notice that is false or misleading in a material particular, shall be guilty of an offence punishable on conviction by a fine not exceeding £4200.

(2) It shall be a defence if a person charged with an offence arising under sub-paragraph (1) (a) above proves that he took all reasonable steps to comply with the requirement or order.

33.	Any person who dismisses an employee, or injures him in his employment, or alters his position to his prejudice, by reason of the circumstance that an attachment of earnings order has been made in relation to the employee or that the person is required to make payments under such an order in relation to the employee, shall be guilty of an offence punishable on conviction by a fine not exceeding N200.

34.	In any proceedings for an offence arising under paragraph 33 above, if all the facts and circumstances constituting the offence, other than the reason for the action of the person charged with having committed the offence, are proved, the burden shall be upon that person to prove that he was not actuated by the reason alleged in the charge.

35.	Where a person is convicted of an offence arising under paragraph 33 above, the court by which he is convicted may order that the employee be reimbursed any wages lost by him, and may also direct that the employee be reinstated in his old position or in a similar position.

36.	The Schedule shall have effect in relation to a defendant notwithstanding any law that would otherwise prevent the attachment of his earnings or limit the amount capable of being attached.
