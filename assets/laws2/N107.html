SIXTH SCHEDULE

Tinapa’s Market Categorisation for Customs Duty Consideration

1.	Goods imported into the NCT for re-sale

The target market for this category of goods includes Nigeria’s business community comprising traders involved in import or export activities, wholesalers and retailers.

2.

A large proportion of this target market for TFZR currently import their goods from Europe, Asia and the Middle-East and it is expected that the volume of trade within the Zone will provide a large enough market to serve the needs of this target market, resulting in substantial foreign exchange sayings in travel expenses and hotel accommodation costs.

3.

As this category of goods will be purchased in commercial quantities, the following shall apply—

(a)	only the categories of goods that are not banned or prohibited by the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) will fall under this category;

(b) Nigerian importers shall be required to process a Form ‘M’ through any authorised dealer bank, whether or not payment is involved; and

(c) customs duty shall be levied on the goods at the appropriate rate by the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS), at the point of exit from the Zone, unless there is an express exemption of duty on such goods.

4.

(1)	It is anticipated that a significant portion of trade from TFZR will boost exports and trading activities with traders along the West African coast who traditionally source their imports for their respective countries from the Middle-East and Far East Asia and this category of traders will constitute a large potential market for TFZR, with large or wholesale consignments being purchased from TFZR for export to destinations outside Nigeria.

(2)	As this category of goods is for export to destinations outside Nigeria, the following shall apply—

(a)	all the categories of goods traded in TFZR, whether or not the goods are banned or prohibited by FGN will fall under this category; and

(b)	customs duty shall not be levied on the goods by NCS at the point of exit from the Zone.

5.

(1)	This category of goods can be purchased for consumption within TFZR, imported into the NCT or exported out of the NCT for personal consumption and the target market for this category of goods includes the following—

(a)	West African shoppers and leisure seekers;

(b)	Nigerians;

(c)	expatriates resident in Nigeria;

(d)	International visitors.

(2)	As this category of goods is for personal consumption purposes only, the following shall apply—

(a)	all the categories of goods traded in TFZR, whether or not the goods are banned or prohibited by FGN shall fall under this category;

(b)	the value of this category of goods (imported into the NCT) shall be guided by free zone passenger concession as published by the Nigeria Customs Service;

(c)	customs duty shall not be levied on such goods by NCS at the point of exit from the Zone; and

(d)	all other customs and licensing requirements that apply to goods imported into the NCT from other countries shall not apply to this category of goods including the processing of Form M.

(3)	Apart from the complexities that will likely be associated with administering duty on such small items, the economic and employment benefits associated with the increased level of tourism and related economic activities resulting from an increased number of domestic West African and international visitors into the south region of the country far outweigh the value of duty from personal effects.

SEVENTH SCHEDULE

Organisation of TFZR for Customs Purpose

1.	For proper administration of Customs functions in TFZR, a Customs Processing Centre (CPC) shall be established outside the Zone. The CPC shall be managed by designated officials of the NCS under the control of an Area Command. The functions of the CPC, aside from day-to-day management of the CPC facilities shall include the following—

(a)	liaise with officials of TBRL on a continuous basis to establish and implement effective and efficient customs procedures to be adopted for the Zone;

(b)	process the relevant Customs documents for goods entering and exiting TFZR;

(c)	advise on the proper classification of goods, within TFZR, for Customs purpose only;

(d)	determine the duty payable on goods other than goods for personal consumption;

(e)	collect duty on behalf of Government as appropriate.

2.	The perimeter of TFZR shall be fenced to prevent unapproved entry or exit of goods from the Zone. The perimeter of the Zone shall also be monitored regularly by the officials of the NCS attached to the CPC.

3.	Goods shall be entered in the CCVO, which is very important for the administration of customs duty within the Zone because of the peculiar nature of the Zone. TFZR is designed to provide a mix of services and goods to tourists and customers. As such, goods purchased within the Zone must be invoiced separately from services to avoid subjecting the services to customs duty. The standardised invoices will also be easily recognised and authenticated by the CPC. 

4.	The invoices shall have special features as advised by the CPC which may include HS Code for the goods, the quantity of goods sold, the destination of the goods and whether or not the purchase qualifies as items for personal consumption/effects.

EIGHTH SCHEDULE

Customs Procedures within TFZR

1.

All items imported into TFZR must be entered by the CPC. The goods are not subject to import duty, at this point, due to the free zone status of TFZR. However, upon entry of the goods, the appropriate HS Codes for the items must be determined by the CPC and communicated to every importer together with the appropriate customs duty rate. This code must be stated on every invoice/receipt issued by the importer/seller of the goods to the buyers at the point of sale. The CPC must also have a record of the quantity of goods imported by each importer into the Zone for the purpose of reconciling with the total quantity claimed to have been sold. All the above information must be promptly entered into a database designed for such purpose.

Considering the free zone status of TFZR, all goods, including goods that are banned or prohibited for importation into the NCT will be allowed for importation into the Zone.

Goods that are expressly prohibited from being exported out of the country may not be allowed into TFZR from the NCT. The exception to this prohibition may be items which are designated for input as raw materials for the production of a final product (which in itself is not prohibited). The CPC will be responsible for monitoring the movement of these prohibited goods.

2.

Goods manufactured within TFZR must be accounted to the CPC in terms of quantity and materials used for the production. Where inputs into the production of the goods include items that have been previously imported into TFZR, the CPC must be promptly informed. After inspection of the goods produced, the CPC must delete the inputs from its records and allocate appropriate HS code to the final product.

3.

Goods which became expired, damaged or destroyed after being delivered to TFZR must be reported and accounted for to the CPC for the purpose of its records. Such items must be immediately deleted by the CPC from its records upon confirmation of their status.

4.

The sellers within TFZR must be familiar with sales that constitute personal effects and indicate this fact on the invoices/receipts issued for goods sold which quality under this category. The receipts/invoices for items consumed within the territory must also be appropriately denoted. Copies of the receipts/invoices for goods consumed with TFZR and for personal effects must be forwarded to the CPC on a regular basis or as agreed for the purpose of updating its records.

5.

The sellers within TFZR must be familiar with sales that consult personal effects and indicate this fact on the invoices/receipts issued for goods said which qualify under this category. The receipts/invoices for items being exported by buyers into the NCT must also be appropriately denoted. Copies of the receipts/invoices must also be forwarded to the CPC on a regular basis or as agreed for the purpose of updating its records.

The value of this category of goods shall be guided by free passenger concession as published by the Nigeria Customs Service.

6.

(1) Goods which are purchased in large quantities from TFZR and destined for exportation to a country other than Nigeria would qualify under this category. Invoices for such goods must be appropriately marked. The country of destination must also be indicated.

(2)	Goods that are deemed for 'personal consumption' will not fall under the 'goods for export' category.

(3)	At the point of purchase of the goods, the sellers would request for evidence of exportation of the goods outside Nigeria, which may be in the form of air waybill, ocean bill of lading, inland bill of lading or a letter of commitment from the transporters, depending on the means of transportation.

(4)	The details of the goods purchased for export shall be entered into a database immediately after the purchase, as this would form the basis of inspection by the CPC at the point of exit. The customs invoice should also be provided in quadruplicate. The original copy would be retained by the customer, a second copy would be kept by the trader, a third copy would be sent to the CPC and the fourth copy to Zone Management.

(5)	The CPC shall perform the requisite inspection of the goods, at the time of exit from TFZR to ensure that the description and quantity agree with the customs invoice issued by the seller and after the inspection, a customs clearance shall be issued to the exporter by the CPC. The CPC shall also be responsible for monitoring the movement of the goods up to the port of exit from Nigeria to ensure that the goods are not diverted for resale within the NCT. The exported goods shall be deleted from the CPC records.

(6)	In a bid to properly monitor the movement of the goods from TFZR without the buyers diverting the goods into the NCT, the CPC may arrange for the use of bonded warehouses both at TFZR and at the port of exit before the goods are taken out of the country. For goods to be transported out of the country by road, the buyers should be encouraged to have their means of transportation ready to transport the goods from TFZR.

7. Goods imported into the NCT

Goods purchased within TFZR for resale within the NCT qualify under this category. This shall represent large or wholesale quantities as agreed between TBRL and the CPC which are destined for other parts of the Nigerian territory outside TFZR and other free zones in the country, such imports into the NCT are subject to customs duty as appropriate unless there is an express exemption of duty on such goods.

(1)	Goods that are deemed for 'personal consumption' will not fall under the 'goods imported into the NCT' category.

(2)	Under this category, on the basis of the HS Code of the goods being sold and the appropriate duly rate the traders at TFZR shall calculate the customs duty on the goods sold to their customers. The duty shall be collected on behalf of the NCS together with the prices of the goods. The sellers will then on a periodic basis, as may be agreed with the CPC, reconcile its records with that of the CPC and remit all the collected duty to the CPC in a manner to be agreeable to both parties. It is the sellers’ responsibility to ensure that the duty on invoices marked for entry into the NCT is collected on behalf of the Customs.

(3)	Once the goods are to exit from TFZR, the CPC shall inspect the customs invoice, the receipt of payment for the goods and customs duty to ensure consistency and correctness. The CPC shall also inspect the goods to be imported into the NCT and ensure that they conform to the quantity stated in the customs invoice. Any discrepancies shall be resolved before the release of the goods by CPC to the importer. Upon inspection to the satisfaction of the CPC, a custom clearance shall be issued to the importer. The CPC shall also delete the imported items from its records.

Lagos Free Zone Market Categorisation for Customs Duty Considerations

1.	Goods Imported into the NCT for resale

The target market for this category of goods includes Nigeria’s business community comprising traders involved in import or export activities, wholesalers and retailers.

2.	A large proportion of this target market for LFTZC currently import their goods from Europe, Asia and Middle-East and it is expected that the volume of trade within the Zone will provide a large enough market to serve the needs of this target market, resulting in substantial foreign exchange savings in travel expenses and hotel accommodation costs.

3.	Goods purchased for personal consumption

As this category of goods will be purchased in commercial quantities, the following shall apply—

(a)	only the categories of goods that are not banned or prohibited by the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) will fall under this category;

(b)	Nigerian importers shall be required to process a Form ‘M’ through any authorised dealer bank, whether or not payment is involved; and

(c)	customs duty shall be levied on the goods at the appropriate rate the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS), at the point of exit from the Zone, unless there is an express exemption of duty on such goods.

4.	(1) It is anticipated that a significant portion of trade from LFTZC will boost exports and trading activities with traders along the West Africa coast who traditionally source their imports for their respective countries from the Middle-East and Far East and Far East Asia and this category of traders will constitute a large potential market for LFTZC, with large or wholesale consignments being purchased from LFTZC for export to destinations outside Nigeria.

(2) As this category of goods is for export to destinations outside Nigeria, the following shall apply—

(a)	all the categories of goods traded in LFTZC, whether or not the goods are banned or prohibited by FGN will fall under this category; and

(b)	customs duty shall not be levied on the goods by NCS at the point of exit from the Zone,

5.	(1) This category of goods can be purchased for consumption within LFTZC, imported into the NCT or exported out of the NCT for personal consumption and the target market for this category of goods includes the following—

(а)	West African shoppers and leisure seekers;

(b)	Nigerians;

(c)	ex-patriate resident in Nigeria; and

(d) International.

(2)	As this category of goods is for personal consumption purpose only the following shall apply—

(3)	Apart from the complexities that will likely be associated with administering duty on such small items, the economic and employment benefit associated with the increased level of tourism and related economic activities resulting from an increased number of domestic. West African and International visitors into the south region of the country far outweigh the value of duty form personal effects.

SEVENTH SCHEDULE

Organisation of LFTZfor Customs Purpose

1.	For proper administration of Customs functions in LFTZ, a Customs Processing Centre (CPC) shall be established outside the Zone.

EIGHTH SCHEDULE

Customs Procedures with LFTZ

1.	Goods Imported into LFTZ

All items imported into LFTZ must be entered by the CPC. The goods are not subject to import duty, at this point, due to the free zone status of LFTZ. However, upon entry of the goods, the appropriate HS Codes for the items must be determined by the CPC and communicated to every importer together with the appropriate customs duty rate. This code must be stated on every invoice/receipt issued by the importer/seller of the goods to the buyers at the point of sale. The CPC must also have a record of the quantity of goods imported by each importer into the Zone for the purpose of reconciling with the total quantity claimed to have been sold. All the above information must be promptly entered into a database designed for such purpose.

Considering the free zone status of LFTZ, all goods, including goods that are banned or prohibited for importation into the NCT will be allowed for importation into the Zone.

Goods that are expressly prohibited from being exported out of the country may not be allowed into LFTZ from the NCT. The exception to this prohibition may be items which are designated for input as raw materials for the production of a final product (which in itself is not prohibited). The CPC will be responsible for monitoring the movement of these prohibited goods.

2.	Goods Manufactured within LFTZ

Goods manufactured within LFTZ must be accounted to the CPC in terms of quantity and materials used for the production. Where inputs into the production of the goods include items that have been previously imported into LFTZ, the CPC must be promptly informed. After inspection of the goods produced, the CPC must delete the inputs from its records and allocate appropriate HS code to the final product.

3.	Damaged expired or destroyed Goods

Goods which became expired, damaged or destroyed after being delivered to LFTZ must be reported and accounted for to the CPC for the purpose of its records. Such items must be immediately deleted by the CPC from its records upon confirmation of their status.

The receipts/invoices for items being exported by buyers into the NCT must also be appropriately denoted. Copies of the receipts/invoices must also be forwarded to the CPC on a regular basis or as agreed for the purpose of updating its records,

The value of this category of goods shall be guided by free passenger concession as published by the Nigeria Customs Service.

(1)	Goods which are purchased in large quantities from LFTZ and destined for exportation to a country other than Nigeria would qualify under this category. Invoices for such goods must be appropriately marked. The country of destination must also be indicated.

(2)	Goods that are deemed for 'personal consumption' will not fall under the 'goods for export' category.

(3)	At the point of purchase of the goods, the sellers would request for evidence of the goods outside Nigeria, which may be in the form of air waybill, ocean bill or lading, inland bill or lading or a letter of commitment from the transporters, depending on the means of transportation.

(4)	The details of the goods purchased for export shall be entered into a database immediately after the purchase, as this would form the basis of inspection by CPC at the point of exit. The customs invoice should also be provided in quadruplicate, the original copy would be retained by the customer, a second copy would be kept by the trader, a third copy would be sent to the CPC and the fourth copy to Zone management.

(5)	The CPC shall perform the requisite inspection of goods, at the time of exit from LFTZ to ensure that the description and quantity agree with the customs invoice issued by the seller and after the inspection, a customs clearance shall be issued to the exporter by the CPC. The CPC shall also be responsible for monitoring the movement of the goods up to the port of exit from Nigeria to ensure that the goods are not diverted for resale within the NCT. The exported goods shall be deleted from the CPC records.

(6)	In a bid to properly monitor the movement of the goods from LFTZ, without the buyers diverting the goods into the NCT, the CPC may arrange for the use of bonded warehouses both at LFTZ and at the port of exit before the goods are taken out of the country. For goods to be transported out of the country by road, the buyers should be encouraged to have their means of transportation ready to transport the goods from LFTZ.

7.	Goods Imported into Nigeria

Goods purchased within LFTZ for resale with the NCT qualify under this category. This shall represent large or wholesale quantities as agreed between TBRL and the CPC which are destined for other parts of the Nigerian territory outside LFTZ and other free zones in the country, such imports into the NCT are subject to customs duty as appropriate unless there is an express exemption of duty on such goods.

(1)	Goods that are deemed for 'personal consumption' will not fall under the 'goods imported into the NCT' category.

(2)	Under this category, on the basis of the HS Code of the goods being sold and the appropriate duty rate the trailers at LFTZ shall calculate the customs duty on the goods sold to their customers. The duty shall be collected on behalf of the NCS together with the prices of the goods. The sellers will then on a periodic basis, as may be agreed with the CPC, reconcile its records with that of the CPC and remit all the collected duty to the CPC in a manner to be agreeable to both parties. It is the sellers then responsibility to ensure that the duty on invoices marked for entry into the NCT is collected on behalf of the Customs.

(3)	Once the goods are to exit from LFTZ the CPC shall inspect the customs invoice, the receipt of payment for the goods and customs ensure consistency and correctness. The CPC shall also inspect the goods to be imported into the NCT and ensure that they conform to the quantity staled in the customs invoice. Any discrepancies shall be resolved before the release of the goods by CPC to the importer.

Upon inspection to the satisfaction of the CPC a customs clearance shall be issued to the importer. The CPC shall also delete the imported items from its records.

4.	(1) It is anticipated that a significant portion of trade from KFTZ will boost exports and trading activities with traders along the West African coast who traditionally source their imports for their respective countries from the Middle-East and Far East Asia and this category of traders will constitute a large potential market for KFTZ, with large or wholesale consignments being purchased from KFTZ for export to destinations outside Nigeria.

(2)	As this category of goods is for export to destinations outside Nigeria, the following shall apply—

(a)	all the categories of goods traded in KFTZ, whether or not the goods are banned or prohibited by FGN will under this category; and

(b)	customs duty shall not be levied on the goods by NCS at the point of exit from the Zone.

5.	 Goods purchased for personal consumption.—(1) This category of goods can be purchased for consumption within KFTZ, imported into the NCT or exported out of the NCT for personal consumption and the target market for this category of goods includes the following—

(a)	West African shoppers and leisure seekers;

(b)	Nigerians;

(c)	expatriate resident in Nigeria; and (d) International.

(2)	As this category of goods is for personal consumption purpose only, the following shall apply—

(a)	all the categories of goods traded in KFTZ, whether or not the goods are banned or prohibited by FGN shall fall under this category;

(b)	the value of this category of goods (imported into the NCT) shall be guided by free zone passenger concession as published by the Nigeria Customs Service;

(c)	Customs Duty shall not be levied on such goods by NCS at the point of exit from the Zone; and

(d)	all other Customs and licensing requirements that apply to goods imported into the NCT from other countries shall not apply to this category of goods including the processing of Form 'M'

(3)	Apart from the complexities that will likely be associated with administering duty on such small items, the economic and employment benefits associated with the increased level of tourism and related economic activities resulting from an increased number of domestic. West African and international visitors into the south-south region of the country far outweigh the value of duty form personal effects.

SEVENTH SCHEDULE

(4)	The invoices shall have special features as advised by the CPC which may include HS Code for the goods, the quantity of goods sold, the destination of the goods and whether or not the purchase qualifies as items for personal consumption/effects.

7.	Goods imported into the NCT.—Goods purchased within KFTZ for resale with the NCT qualify under this category.

SIXTH SCHEDULE

Lekki’s Market Categorisation for Customs Duty Consideration

1.	Goods imported into the NCT for resale. —The target market for this category of goods includes Nigeria’s business community comprising traders involved in import/export activities, wholesalers and retailers.

2.	A large proportion of this target market for LFTZ currently import their goods from Europe, Asia and the Middle-East and it is expected that the volume of trade within the Zone will provide a large enough market to serve the needs of this target market, resulting in substantial foreign exchange savings in travel expenses and hotel accommodation costs.

3.	As this category of goods will be purchased in commercial quantities, the following shall apply—

(a) only the categories of goods that are not banned or prohibited by the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) will fall under this category;

(b)	Nigerian importers will be required to process a Form ‘M’ through any authorised dealer bank, whether or not payment is involved; and

(c)	customs duty will be levied on the goods at the appropriate rate by the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS), at the point of exit from the Zone, unless there is an express exemption of duty on such goods.

4.	(1) It is anticipated that a significant portion of trade from LFTZ will boost exports and trading activities with traders along the West African coast who traditionally source their imports for their respective countries from the Middle-East and Far East Asia and this category of traders will constitute a large potential market for LFTZ, with large or wholesale consignments being purchased from LFTZ for export to destinations outside Nigeria.

(2) As this category of goods is for export to destinations outside Nigeria, the following shall apply—

(a)	all the categories of goods traded in LFTZ, whether or not the goods are banned or prohibited by FGN will fall under this category; and

(b)	customs duty will not be levied on the goods by NCS at the point of exit from the Zone.

5.	Goods purchased, for personal consumption. —(1) This category of goods can be purchased for con-sumption within LFTZ, imported into the NCT or exported out of the NCT for personal consumption and the target market for this category of goods includes the following—

(a)	 West African shoppers and leisure seekers;

(b)	Nigerians;

(c)	Expatriates resident in Nigeria; and

(d)	International visitors.

(c)	customs duty will not be levied on such goods by NCS at the point of exit from the Zone; and

(d)	all other customs and licensing requirements that apply to goods imported into the NCT from other countries shall not apply to this category of goods including the processing of Form M.

(3)	Apart from the complexities that will likely be associated with administering duty on such small items, the economic and employment benefits associated with the increased level of tourism and related economic activities resulting from an increased number of domestic. West African and international visitors into the south-south region of the country far outweigh the value of duty from personal effects.

SEVENTH SCHEDULE

Organisation ofLFTZ for Customs Purpose

1.

The standardised invoices will also be easily recognised and authenticated by the CPC.

4.	The invoices must have special features as advised by the CPC which may include HS Code for the goods, the quantity of goods sold, the destination of the goods and whether or not the purchase qualifies as items for personal consumption/effects.

This code must be stated on every invoices/receipts issued by the importer/seller of the goods to the buyers at the point of sale. The CPC must also have a record of the quantity of goods imported by each importer into the Zone for the purpose of reconciling with the total quantity claimed to have been sold. All the above information must be promptly entered into a database designed for such purpose.

Considering the free zone status of LFTZ, all goods, including goods that are banned or prohibited for importation into the NCT will be allowed for importation into the Zone.

Goods that are expressly prohibited from being exported out of the country may not be allowed into LFTZ from the NCT. The exception to this prohibition may be items which are designated for input as raw materials for the production of a final product (which in itself is not prohibited). The CPC will be responsible for monitoring the movement of these prohibited goods.

(3)	At the point of purchase of the goods, the sellers would request for evidence of exportation of the goods outside Nigeria. This may be in the form of air waybill, ocean bill of lading, inland bill of lading or; a letter of commitment from the transporters, depending on the means of transportation.

(4)	The details of the goods purchased for export shall be entered into a database immediately after the purchase, as this would form the basis of inspection by the CPC at the point of exit. The customs invoice should also be provided in quadruplicate. The original copy would be retained by the customer, a second copy would be kept by the trader, a third copy would be sent to the CPC and the fourth copy to the Zone Management.

The exported goods shall be deleted from the CPC records.

(6)	In a bid to property monitor the movement of the goods from LFTZ without the buyers diverting the goods into the NCT, the CPC may arrange for the use of bonded warehouses both at LFTZ and at the port of exit before the goods are taken out of the country. For goods to be transported out of the country by road, the buyers should be encouraged to have their means of transportation ready to transport the goods from LFTZ.

7.	Goods imported into the NCT.—Goods purchased within LFTZ for resale within the NCT qualify under this category. This shall represent large or wholesale quantities as agreed between TBRL and the CPC which are destined for other parts of the Nigerian territory outside LFTZ and other free zones in the country, such imports into the NCT are subject to customs duty as appropriate unless there is an express exemption of duty on such goods.

(1)	Goods that are deemed for 'personal consumption' will not fall under the 'goods imported into the NCT' category.

(2)	Under this category, on the basis of the HS Code of the goods being sold and the appropriate duty rate the traders at LFTZ will calculate the customs duty on the goods sold their customers. The duty shall be collected on behalf of the NCS together with the prices of the goods. The sellers will then on a periodic basis, as may be agreed with the CPC, reconcile its records with that of the CPC and remit all the collected duty to the CPC in a manner to be agreeable to both parties. It is the sellers responsibility to ensure that the duty on invoices marked for entry into the NCT is collected on behalf of the Customs.

(3)	Once the goods are to exit from LFTZ, the CPC shall inspect the customs invoice, the receipt of payment for the goods and customs duty to ensure consistency and correctness. The CPC shall also inspect the goods to be imported into the NCT and ensure that they conform to the quantity stated in the customs invoice. Any discrepancies shall be resolved before the release of the goods by CPC to the importer. Upon inspection to the satisfaction of the CPC, a customs clearance shall be issued to the importer. The CPC shall also delete the imported items from its records.

SIXTH SCHEDULE

OKFTZ’s Market Categorisation for Customs Duty Consideration

1.	Goods imported into the NCT for resale

The target market for this category of goods includes Nigeria’s business community comprising traders involved in import/export activities, wholesalers and retailers.

2.	A large proportion of this target market for OKFTZ currently import their goods from Europe, Asia and the Middle-East and it is expected that the volume of trade within the Zone will provide a large enough market to serve the needs of this target market, resulting in substantial foreign exchange savings in travel expenses and hotel accommodation costs.

3.	As this category of goods will be purchased in commercial quantities, the following shall apply—

(a)	only the categories of goods that are not banned or prohibited by the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) will fall under this category;

(b)	Nigerian Importers will be required to process a Form ‘M’ through any authorised dealer Bank, whether or not payment is involved; and

(c)	customs duty will be levied on the goods at the appropriate rate by the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS), at the point of exit from the Zone, unless there is an express exemption of duty on such goods.

4.	(1) It is anticipated that a significant portion of trade from OKFTZ will boost exports and trading activities with traders along the West African Coast who traditionally source their imports for their respective countries from the Middle-East and Far East Asia and this category of traders will constitute a large potential market for OKFTZ, with large or wholesale consignments being purchased from OKFTZ for export to destinations outside Nigeria.

(2)	As this category of goods is for export to destinations outside Nigeria, the following shall apply—

(a)	all the categories of goods traded in OKFTZ, whether or not the goods are banned or prohibited by FGN will fall under this category; and

(b)	customs duty will not be levied on the goods by NCS at the point of exit from the Zone.

5.	Goods purchased for personal consumption

(1)	This category of goods can be purchased for consumption within OKFTZ, imported into the NCT or exported out of the NCT for personal consumption and the target market for this category of goods includes the following—

(a)	West African shoppers and leisure seekers;

(b)	Nigerians;

(c)	expatriates resident in Nigeria; and

(d)	International visitors.

(2)	As this category of goods is for personal consumption purposes only, the following shall apply—

(a)	 all the categories of goods traded in OKFTZ, whether or not the goods are banned or prohibited by FGN will fall under this category;

(b)	the value of this category of goods (imported into the NCT) shall be guided by free zone passenger concession as published by the Nigeria Customs Service;

(c)	customs duty will not be levied on such goods by NCS at the point of exit from the Zone; and

(d)	all other Customs and licensing requirements that apply to goods imported into the NCT from other countries shall not apply to this category of goods including the processing of Form M.

(3)	Apart from the complexities that will likely be associated with administering duty on such small items, the economic and employment benefits associated with the increased level of tourism and related economic activities resulting from an increased number of domestic, West African and International Visitors into the south region of the country far outweigh the value of duty from personal effects.

SEVENTH SCHEDULE

Organisation of OKFTZ for Customs Purpose

1.	For proper administration of Customs functions in OKFTZ, a Customs Processing Centre (CPC) must be established outside the Zone. The CPC will be managed by designated officials of the NCS under the control of an Area Command. The functions of the CPC, aside from day-to-day management of the CPC facilities will include the following—

(a)     liaise with officials of OKFTZ on a continuous basis to establish and implement effective and efficient customs procedures to be adopted for the Zone;

(b)	process the relevant Customs documents for goods entering and exiting OKFTZ;

(c)	advise on the proper classification of goods, within OKFTZ, for Customs purpose only;

(d)	determine the duty payable on goods other than goods for personal consumption;

(e)	collect duty on behalf of Government as appropriate.

2.	The perimeter of OKFTZ must be fenced to prevent unapproved entry or exit of goods from the Zone. The perimeter of the Zone will also be monitored regularly by the officials of the NCS attached to the CPC.

3.	Goods must be entered in the CCVO. This is very important for the administration of customs duty within the Zone because of the peculiar nature of the Zone. OKFTZ is designed to provide a mix of services and goods to tourists and customers. As such, goods purchased within the Zone must be invoiced separately from services to avoid subjecting the services to customs duty. The standardised invoices will also be easily recognised and authenticated by the CPC.

4.	The invoices must have special features as advised by the CPC which may include HS Code for the goods, the quantity of goods sold, the destination of the goods and whether or not the purchase qualifies as items for personal consumption/effects.

All items imported into OKFTZ must be entered by the CPC. The goods are not subject to import duty, at this point, due to the free zone status of OKFTZ. However, upon entry of the goods, the appropriate HS Codes for the items must be determined by the CPC and communicated to every importer together with the appropriate customs duty rate. This code must be stated on every invoices/receipts issued by the im- porter/seller of the goods to the buyers at the point of sale. The CPC must also have a record of the quantity of goods imported by each importer into the Zone for the purpose of reconciling with the total quantity claimed to have been sold. All the above information must be promptly entered into a database designed for such purpose.

Considering the free zone status of OKFTZ, all goods, including goods that are banned or prohibited for importation into the NCT will be allowed for importation into the Zone.

Goods that are expressly prohibited from being exported out of the country may not be allowed into OKFTZ from the NCT. The exception to this prohibition may be items which are designated for input as raw materials for the production of a final product (which in itself is not prohibited). The CPC will be responsible for monitoring the movement of these prohibited goods.

2.	Goods Manufactured within OKFTZ

Goods manufactured within OKFTZ must be accounted to the CPC in terms of quantity and materials used for the production. Where inputs into the production of the goods include items that have been previously imported into OKFTZ, the CPC must be promptly informed. After inspection of the goods produced, the CPC must delete the inputs from its records and allocate appropriate HS code to the final product.

3.	Damaged, Expired or Destroyed Goods

Goods which became expired, damaged or destroyed after being delivered to OKFTZ must be reported and accounted for to the CPC for the purpose of its records. Such items must be immediately deleted by the CPC from its records upon confirmation of their status.

4.	Personal Effects and Goods Consumed in OKFTZ

The sellers within OKFTZ must be familiar with sales that constitute personal effects and indicate this fact on the invoices/receipts issued for goods sold which qualify under this category. The re- ceipts/invoices for items consumed within the territory must also be appropriately denoted. Copies of the receipts/invoices for goods consumed with OKFTZ and for personal effects must be forwarded to the CPC on a regular basis or as agreed for the purpose of updating its records.

5.	Personal Effects and Goods Exported into the NCT

The sellers within OKFTZ must be familiar with sales that constitute personal effects and indicate this fact on the invoices/receipts issued for goods sold which qualify under this category. The receipts/invoices for items being exported by buyers into the NCT must also be appropriately denoted. Copies of the receipts/invoices must also be forwarded to the CPC on a regular basis or as agreed for the purpose of updating its records.

The value of this category of goods shall be guided by free passenger concession as published by the Nigeria Customs Service.

6.	Goods for Export

(1)	Goods which are purchased in large quantities from OKFTZ and destined for exportation to a country other than Nigeria would qualify under this category. Invoices for such goods must be appropriately marked. The country of destination must also be indicated.

(2)	Goods that are deemed for 'personal consumption' will not fall under the 'goods for export' category.

(3)	At the point of purchase of the goods, the sellers would request for evidence of exportation of the goods outside Nigeria. This may be in the form of air waybill, ocean bill of lading, inland bill of lading or a letter of commitment from the transporters, depending on the means of transportation.

(4)	The details of the goods purchased for export shall be entered into a database immediately after the purchase, as this would form the basis of inspection by the CPC at the point of exit. The customs invoice should also be provided in quadruplicate. The original copy would be retained by the customer, a second copy would be kept by the trader, a third copy would be sent to the CPC and the fourth copy to the Zone Management.

(5)	The CPC shall perform the requisite inspection of the goods, at the time of exit from OKFTZ to ensure that the description and quantity agree with the customs invoice issued by the seller and after the inspection, a customs clearance shall be issued to the exporter by the CPC. The CPC shall also be responsible for monitoring the movement of the goods up to the port of exit from Nigeria to ensure that the goods are not diverted for resale within the NCT. The exported goods shall be deleted from the CPC records. 

(6)	In a bid to properly monitor the movement of the goods from OKFTZ without the buyers diverting the goods into the NCT, the CPC may arrange for the use of bonded warehouses both at OKFTZ and at the port of exit before the goods are taken out of the country. For goods to be transported out of the country by road, the buyers should be encouraged to have their means of transportation ready to transport the goods from OKFTZ.

7.	Goods imported into the NCT

Goods purchased within OKFTZ for resale within the NCT qualify under this category. This shall represent large or wholesale quantities as agreed between TBRL and the CPC which are destined for other parts of the Nigerian territory outside OKFTZ and other free zones in the country, such imports into the NCT are subject to customs duty as appropriate unless there is an express exemption of duty on such goods.

(1)	Goods that are deemed for 'personal consumption' will not fall under the 'goods imported into the NCT' category.

(2)	Under this category, on the basis of the HS Code of the goods being sold and the appropriate duty rate the traders at OKFTZ will calculate the customs duty on the goods sold their customers. The duty shall be collected on behalf of the NCS together with the prices of the goods. The sellers will then on a periodic basis, as may be agreed with the CPC, reconcile its records with that of the CPC and remit all the collected duty to the CPC in a manner to be agreeable to both parties. It is the sellers’ responsibility to ensure that the duty on invoices marked for entry into the NCT is collected on behalf of the Customs.

(3)	Once the goods are to exit from OKFTZ, the CPC shall inspect the customs invoice, the receipt of payment for the goods and customs duty to ensure consistency and correctness. The CPC shall also inspect the goods to be imported into the NCT and ensure that they conform to the quantity stated in the customs invoice. Any discrepancies shall be resolved before the release of the goods by CPC to the importer. Upon inspection to the satisfaction of the CPC, a customs clearance shall be issued to the importer. The CPC shall also delete the imported items from its records.
