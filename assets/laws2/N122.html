8.	Making of awards

Where the Board, after consideration of the report of the committee of assessors mentioned in section 7 of this Act, is of opinion that the circumstances are such as to render it expedient that an award be made to a particular person or that a joint award should be made to two persons in the field concerned, it shall transmit its decision to the secretary to the Government of the Federation not later than 1 September in each year so as to enable the President to make the Award to the recipient or recipients concerned on the first Thursday in the month of December:
