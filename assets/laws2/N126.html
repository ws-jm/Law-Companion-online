(b)	where lorries for the transportation of produce having been ordered by the Authority to meet a ship’s pre-arranged schedules of loading, are subsequently not used or dismissed for any reason not attributable to the Authority, for every hour during which the lorries are ordered but not used.

(2)	Lorries may be delayed or not be used under this paragraph by non-arrival of ship, ship not working all hatches for which cargo has been requested or ship not working for any reason whatsoever.

13.	(1) The indirect wharfinger rates cover the following services—

(a)	in the case of imports, receiving cargo from a ship berthed alongside the Authority quay into transit areas, stacking to prime marks and delivery alongside transit loading bay. For the purposes of raising charges, the receiving and stacking in the transit area, and the delivery thereaNer are two distinct operations;

(b)	in the case of exports, receiving cargo into a transit area, tendering to ship berthed alongside the Authority’s quay immediately adjacent the transit area into which the cargo was initially received. The receiving and piling of cargo and the delivery thereaNer are two distinct operations for charging purposes.

(2) The direct and indirect wharfinger rates shall not include wharfage, weighing, haulage and transferring, and the use of equipment for shorehandling of packages weighing beyond one tonne.

14.

When a ship whose departure or arrival date has been announced fails to arrive within the free period allowed to exports because of stress of weather, accident, breakdown or other emergency, the free time al-lowed to exports awaiting the ship may be extended by not more than ten days: provided that transit area rates or demurrage have not accrued prior to the notification of the arrival or departure date of the ship. ThereaNer, appropriate transit area rates shall be assessed against such exports.

8.	Where goods are bulk-stacked, transit area rates may at the discretion of the executive chairman be levied on the basis that the goods which arrived first are shipped first.

9.	The transit area rate for passengers’ baggage shall be HI.56 per package per calendar day, aNer the free period. 

THIRD SCHEDULE, PART \M—continued

10.	Under no circumstances will goods be allowed to remain in a transit area for any period in excess of thirty-five days aNer the appropriate free storage period.

14.	Warehouse rates shall be quoted by the Commercial and Development Department to a shipper or consignee who has given notice of his intention to warehouse his goods, where such goods have been accepted for storage by the Authority.

15.	Warehouse rates are designed for storage of goods in port warehouses which are intended for long-term, medium-term, or short-term storage and shall not contain a penal element.
