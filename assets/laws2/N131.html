[Date of commencement: 1st July, 1976] Constitution and Functions of the Corporation, etc.

1.	Establishment of the Nigeria Reinsurance Corporation

(1)	There shall be established a corporation to be known as the Nigeria Reinsurance Corporation (in this Act referred to as 'the Corporation”) which shall be constituted in accordance with and shall have such powers and duties as are conferred on it by the following provisions of this Act.

(2)	The Corporation shall be a body corporate with perpetual succession and a common seal.

(3)	The Corporation may sue or be sued in its corporate name and may hold, acquire, and dispose of any property movable or immovable.

2.	Functions of the Corporation

(1)	Subject to the provisions of this Act, the Corporation shall have power, within or outside Nigeria, to carry on reinsurance of any class of insurance business, including life insurance business, and to reinsure against loss of any kind arising from any risk or contingency in respect of any matter whatsoever.

[No. 52 of 1988.]

(2)	Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1) of this section, the Corporation shall have power to do any of the following things, that is—

(a)	to reinsure with any insurer carrying on insurance or reinsurance business, any risk undertaken by the Corporation and for that purpose to enter into reinsurance contracts; and

(b)	to accept the reinsurance of any part of risks undertaken by any other person (being risks such that the Corporation has power to reinsure against) and to retrocede any part of such risk.

(3)	Except as may be expressly provided for by an order made under subsection (5) of this section, the Corporation shall have power to do anything or to enter into any transaction, which in the opinion of the Board is calculated to facilitate the due performance of the functions of the Corporation under this Act and in particular the Corporation may—

(a)	acquire any undertaking of any registered insurer or acquire, hold or have any shares or stock in, or any financial interest in any such undertaking;

(b)	acquire and invest in any other profitable business; and

(c)	assist in organising training schemes for employees of any registered insurer.

(4)	Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the African Reinsurance Corporation shall deal directly with insurance and reinsurance companies operating in Nigeria in respect of the five per cent compulsory cessions emanating from Nigeria. 

(5)	 Where the Minister is of the opinion that it is in the public interest so to do, he may, with the prior approval of the President, by order published in the Federal Gazette, abridge or restrict the powers of the Corporation to any extent necessary; and when so abridged or restricted, the powers of the Corporation shall be exercisable subject to and in accordance with the provisions of the order, and not otherwise.

(6)	For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that the foregoing provisions of this Act relate only to the capacity of the Corporation as a statutory corporation, and nothing in the said provisions shall be construed as authorising the disregard by the Corporation of any rule of law.

3.	Board of Directors

(1)	There shall be a Board of Directors of the Corporation (referred to as 'the Board”) which shall, subject to the general direction of the Minister, be responsible for the overall policy and general man-agement of the Corporation.

[No. 11 of 1981.]

(2)	The Board shall comprise the following members, that is—

(а)	eight persons (being persons who are not Federal or State public officers) appointed by the President one of which members shall be appointed as Chairman of the Board by the President; and

5.	Directions by the Minister

(1)	The Minister may give to the Board directions of a general or of a special nature with regard to the exercise of the functions of the Corporation; and, as the case may require, it shall be the duty of the Chairman, the Board and the Managing Director to comply with the directions unless matters of policy are in dispute.

(2)	In the application of subsection (1) of this section, where the Minister intends to initiate a policy affecting the exercise of the functions of the Corporation, he shall consult with the Board and in the event of disagreement between the Minister and the Board over the implementation of that policy, the policy and any directive issued in that respect shall stand suspended, so however that if any part of the policy so in dispute is severable from any other aspects of the policy not in dispute, the policy or the directive issued shall be suspended only in respect of the part in dispute; and thereafter the policy or the part in dispute, so suspended shall, upon its being referred by the Minister to the President, be affirmed, modified, or rejected by President, and the President may give such direction thereon as he thinks fit.

6.	Extended application of Insurance Act

(1)	The Insurance Act shall apply to the Corporation to the same extent as it applies to insurers under that Act; and accordingly, and in so far as the provisions of the Insurance Act are not inconsistent with those of this Act, the Corporation shall, where applicable, comply with the requirements of that Act as if the Corporation were an insurer registered pursuant to that Act and the Insurance Act shall in relation to the Corporation have effect and be construed accordingly.

[Cap. 117.]

(2)	The provisions of subsection (1) of this section shall apply mutatis mutandis, to the National Insurance Corporation of Nigeria, established pursuant to the National Insurance Corporation of Nigeria Act.

8.	Recovery of unpaid premiums from registered insurer

(a)	notwithstanding any other enactment be a first charge on the property of the registered insurer; and

(b)	be a debt due to the Corporation and the Corporation may sue for and recover that amount in any court of competent jurisdiction from the registered insurer.

(2)	In any action brought under subsection (1) of this section, the production by the Corporation of a certificate signed by the Director of Insurance setting out the name of the defendant and the amount of premium due shall be sufficient evidence of the amount so due and sufficient authority for the court to give judgment for the said amount.
