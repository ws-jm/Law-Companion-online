1.	Application for recognition as a training hospital

(1)	An application for recognition as an approved training hospital may be made in the Form A in the First Schedule to these Regulations to the State Nursing and Midwifery Committee.

[First Schedule, Form A.]

(2)	If an application under paragraph (1) of this Regulation is received by the Council it shall direct an inspection to be made, unless the State Nursing and Midwifery Committee forwards with the applica-tion a recommendation for its approval; and subject thereto an application under this Regulation shall not be considered by the Council without an inspection made on its behalf.

(3)	Where the Council, after considering the inspection report on a training hospital, is of opinion that the hospital ought to be approved under these Regulations without further inspection, it may approve the application forthwith and in any other case it may impose conditions whereby approval shall have effect for a period not exceeding six months; and if within that period it is satisfied that its requirements have been met it shall thereupon confirm its approval.

(4)	Inspections of a routine nature shall be carried out in all approved training schools at least once in every three years.

(5)	The approval of the Council may in proper case (of which it shall be sole judge and from whose decision there shall be no appeal) at any time be withdrawn, and an action shall not lie at the suit of any person aggrieved by the withdrawal or as the case may be, the refusal of the Council to approve a training hospital under these Regulations.

2.	Minimum requirements for approval

(1)	To qualify for approval under these Regulations as a training hospital, a hospital shall have—

(a)	not less than one hundred and twenty beds (other than maternity beds) divided into wards with adequate equipment to the satisfaction of the Council so as to provide experience in surgical nursing, medical nursing, care of sick children, gynaecological nursing, introduction to obstetrics, genito-urinary nursing, psychiatric nursing, aspects of community nursing and any other experience relating to the care of the sick as the Council may from time to time prescribe;

(b)	an operating theatre with adequate equipment for varied surgical experience;

(c)	an out-patient and casualty section;

(d)	provision for health and welfare of student nurses and for residential accommodation for student nurses during training.

(2)	If a hospital ceases to have a school attached thereto or used therewith, the approval of the Council shall be withdrawn, and any person in apparent charge of the school who permits or allows it to be used as a school after withdrawal of approval shall be guilty of an offence, punishable on conviction by a fine of not less than N4200.

(3)	The Council shall prescribe facilities for every school, and subject thereto there shall be in every school—

(a)	an adequate number of classrooms for clinical instructions; and

(b)	a separate room for practical nursing, with demonstration and library facilities for teaching to the extent as directed by the Council.

3.	Control, etc., of training

In addition to the requirements prescribed by regulation 2 of these Regulations—

The Council may from time to time publish a notice in the Federal Gazette of hospitals approved by it as training hospitals under these Regulations.

5.	Information as to medical, etc., personnel available

Information required by the Council in its control of training hospitals shall be supplied on request made by the registrar and the failure to comply with its requirements as to names and other particulars of medical and nursing personnel available to the training hospital concerned shall be sufficient authority for the Council to withdraw its approval under these Regulations.

[First Schedule, Form G or H.]
