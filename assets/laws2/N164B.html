List of Hazardous Characteristics {United Nations (Un) Code Characteristics Class) UN Class	Code	Characteristics

1.	HI	Explosive

An explosive substance or waste is a solid or liquid substance or waste (or mixture of substances or wastes) which in itself is capable of producing gas by chemical reaction at such a temperature and pressure and at such a speed as to cause damage to the surroundings.

3.	H3	Flammable Liquids

The word 'flammable' has the same meaning as 'inflammable”. Flammable liquids are liquids, or mixtures of liquids, or liquids con-taining solids in solution or suspension (for example paints, varnishes, lacquers and others but not including substances or wastes otherwise classified on account of their dangerous characteristics) which give off a flammable vapour at temperatures of not more than 60.5°C, closed- cup test, or not more than 65.6°C open-cup test (since the results of open cup tests and closed-up tests are not strictly comparable and even individual results by the same tests are often variable, regulations varying from the above figures to make allowance for such difference would be within the spirit of this definition).

Guidelines for Preparing Environmental Management Plan (EMP)

An Environmental Management Plan (BMP) describes the process that an Organisation will follow to maximise its compliance and minimise, harm to the environment. This plan also helps an Organisation map its progress toward achieving continual improvements.

Regardless, of the Organisation’s situation, all environmental plans must include the following elements—

•	Policy;

•	Planning;

•	Implementation and Operation;

Cheeking and Corrective Action;

•	Management Review and Commitment

Policy

Policy, statements arc important to an Organisation because they help anchor the Organisation on a core set of beliefs. These environmental guiding principles will enable all members of an Organisation to focus on the same objective. They provide an opportunity for outside interests to understand the operation of the Organisation, The policy should he focused, concise and easy to read. The environmental policy should address the following—

•	Compliance with legal requirements and voluntary commitments:

•	Minimising waste and preventing pollution;

•	Continual improvement in environmental performance, including areas not subject to regulations;

Sharing information on environmental performance with the community.

Planning

The planning should define the Organisation’s environmental footprints and set goals. Goals and objectives should be focused on maximising their positive impacts on the environment. When evaluating, the following elements should he considered—

•	Impacts on the environment through its activities, products and services;

•	Legal requirements associated with protecting the environment;

•	Meaningful and focused environmental objectives and targets.

EIGHTH SCHEDULE—continued

Implementation and Operation

Implementation and operation should define the activities that the organisation will perform to meet its environmental objectives and targets. This section should identify activity each person is responsible for, ensure completion and set targets for each of the identified activity. In addition, this area should specify employee training, communication and outreach activities that are necessary to ensure successful implementation of the plan.

Checking and Corrective Action

The EMP should describe the process that will be followed to verify proper implementation on how problems will be corrected in a timely manner. Routine evaluation and continual improvement to the process is necessary to make sure that the plan successfully leads towards the completion of environmental objectives and targets.

Management Review and Commitment to Improvement

Routine management review and support is a necessary and meaningful tool for the organisation. This should identify the routine management evaluation that will be conducted to ensure that the plan is appropriately implemented to meet its environmental objectives.

(e)	paving of roads;

(f)     planting special wind break vegetation at critical points;

(g)	prompt removal of coal, rock minerals, soil, and other dust-forming debris from paved roads and scraping and compaction of unpaved roads to stabilise the road surface as often as necessary to minimise re-entrainment of fugitive particulate matter from the road surface;

(h)	restricting the areas to be blasted at any one time;

(i)	restricting the speed of vehicles in or around mining, tailing or quarrying operations;

(j)     re-vegetating, mulching, or otherwise stabilising the surface of all areas adjoining roads that are a source of fugitive particulate emissions;

(k)	substitution of covered conveyor systems for haul trucks; synthetic or re-vegetative covers;

(l)     the paving of roads;

(m)	to the extent practicable, restricting vehicular travel to established paved roads;
