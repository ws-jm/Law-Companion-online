Guideline for Preparing Environmental Management Plan (EMP)

An Environmental Management Plan (EMP) describes the process that an organisation will follow to maximise its compliance and minimise harm to the environment. This plan also helps an organisation map its progress toward achieving continual improvements.

Regardless of the organisation’s situation, all environmental plans must include the following ele-ments—

*	Policy;

*	Planning;

*	Implementation and Operation;

*	Checking and Corrective Action;

*	Management Review and commitment.

POLICY

Policy statements arc important to an organisation because they help anchor the organisation on a core set of beliefs. These environmental guiding principles will enable all members of an organisation to focus on the same objective. They provide an opportunity for outside interests to understand the operation of the organisation. The policy should be focused, concise and easy to read. The environmental policy should address the following—

*	Compliance with legal requirements and voluntary commitments;

*	minimising waste and preventing pollution;

i

*	Continual improvement in environmental performance, including areas not subject to regulations;

*	Sharing information on environmental performance with the community. 

TENTH SCHEDULE—continued

PLANNING

The planning should define the organisation’s environmental footprints and set goals. Goals and objectives should be focused on maximising their positive impacts on the environment. When evaluating, the following elements should be considered—

*	Impacts on the environment through its activities, products and services;

*	Legal requirements associated with protecting the environment;

*	Meaningful and focused environmental objectives and targets.

IMPLEMENTATION AND OPERATION

Implementation and operation should define the activities that the organisation will perform to meet its environmental objectives and targets. This section should identify activity each person is responsible for, ensure completion and set targets for each of the identified activity. In addition, this area should specify employee training, communication and outreach activities that are necessary to ensure successful implementation of the plan.

CHECKING AND CORRECTIVE ACTION

The EMP should describe the process that will be followed to verify proper implementation and how problems will be corrected in a timely manner. Routine evaluation and continual improvement to the process is necessary to make sure that the plan successfully leads towards the completion of environmental objectives and targets.

MANAGEMENT REVIEW AND COMMITMENT TO IMPROVEMENT

Routine management review and support is a necessary and meaningful tool for the organisation. This should identify the routine management evaluations that will be conducted to ensure that the plan is appropriately implemented to meet its environmental objectives.

TENTH SCHEDULE

[Regulation 8(1).]

Guidelines for Consumer Products Stewardship Programme

As part of the Strategic Alliance Programme of the Agency, all manufacturers and importers of Food and Beverages products shall partner with the Agency to establish an effective consumer product Stewardship Programme.

(d)	submit on or before 30 June in each year to the Agency, an annual report on their consumer products stewardship program during the previous fiscal year including, but not limited to, information respecting—

(i)	the total amount of consumer beverage products sold and post-consumer products collected;

NESREA Compliance Flag Award

In order to encourage voluntary compliance by the regulated community, the Agency has established NESREA compliance Flag Award as an incentive-based pollution mechanism. The award will be given on the basis of environmental performance ratings to deserving facilities who comply with regulations, guidelines and standards.

1.	The environmental performance ratings will be disseminated to the, public through the media and it is expected to significantly reduce environmental abuse and neglect. This rating will range from out-standing to non-compliant using five colour codes.

2.	Green Flag represents the best performing company. The criteria for the NESREA Compliance Flag Award are as follows:

THE FIVE LEVEL	Above 75%	Level 1 - Outstanding - Green

NESREA	50% to 75%	Level 2 - Good-Blue
