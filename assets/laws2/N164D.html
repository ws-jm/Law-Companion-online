NESREA Compliance Flag Award

In order to encourage voluntary compliance by the regulated community, the Agency has established NESREA compliance Flag Award as an incentive-based pollution mechanism. The award will be given on the basis of environmental performance ratings to deserving facilities who comply with regulations, guidelines and standards.

The environmental performance ratings will be disseminated to the public through the media and it is expected to significantly reduce environmental abuse and neglect. This rating will range from outstanding to noncompliant using five colour codes:

2. The criteria for the NESREA Compliance Flag Award are as follows—

Above 75%	Level 1 - Outstanding - Green

50% to 75%	Level 2 - Good - blue

35% to 49.9%	Level 3 - Average - yellow

25% to 34.9%	Level 4 - Poor - Red

5% to 24.9%	Level 5 - Non compliant - Black

Green Flag represents the best performing company. For a facility to be adjudged as having achieved 'excellent compliance”, management commitment must have been demonstrated in addition to developing sustainable production technologies that can deliver environmental, economic and social benefits, good house keeping, robust waste management system, etc.

Guideline for Preparing Environmental Management Plan {EMP)

An Environmental Management Plan (EMP) describes the process that an organisation will follow to maximise its compliance and minimise harm to the environment. This plan also helps an organisation map its progress toward achieving continual improvements.

Regardless of the organisation’s situation, all environmental plans must include the following ele-ments—

•	Policy;

•	Planning;

•	Implementation and Operation;

•	Checking and Corrective Action;

•	Management Review and commitment.

Policy

Policy statements are important to an organisation because they help anchor the organisation on a core set of beliefs. These environmental guiding principles will enable all members of an organisation to focus on the same objective. They provide an opportunity for outside interests to understand the operation of the organisation. The policy should be focused, concise and easy to read. The environmental policy should address the following—

•	Compliance with legal requirements and voluntary commitments;

•	Minimising waste and preventing pollution;

FOURTEENTH SCHEDULE—continued

•	Continual improvement in environmental performance, including areas not subject to regulations;

•	Sharing information on environmental performance with the community.

Planning

The planning shall define the organisation’s environmental footprints and set goals. Goals and objectives shall be focus on maximising their positive impacts on the environment. When evaluating, the following elements should be considered—

•	Impacts on the environment through its activities, products and services;

•	Legal requirements associated with protecting the environment;

•	Meaningful and focused environmental objectives and targets.

Implementation and Operation

Implementation and operation should define the activities that the organisation will perform to meet its environmental objectives and targets. This section should identify activity each person is responsible for, ensure completion and set targets for each of the identified activity. In addition, this area should specify employee training, communication and outreach activities that are necessary to ensure successful implementation of the plan.

Monitoring and Corrective Action(s)

The EMP should describe the process that will be followed to verify proper implementation and how problems will be corrected in a timely manner. Routine evaluation and continual improvement to the process is necessary to make sure that the plan successfully leads towards the completion of environmental objectives and targets.

Management Review and Commitment to Improvement

Routine review and support by management is a necessary and meaningful tool for the organisation. This should identify the improvement that will be carried out to ensure that the plan is appropriately imple-mented to meet its environmental objectives.

FIFTEENTH SCHEDULE

Certification Statement

A Certification Statement shall be as follows—

'I certify that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gathered and evaluated the information submitted herein is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate and complete.”

Guideline for Preparing Environmental Management Plan (EMP)

An Environmental Management Plan (EMP) describes the process that an organisation will follow to maximise its compliance and minimise harm to the environment. This plan also helps an organisation map its progress toward achieving continual improvements.

Regardless of the organisation’s situation, all environmental plans must include the following ele-ments—

*	Policy;

*	Planning;

*	Implementation and Operation;

*	Checking and Corrective Action;

*	Management Review and Commitment.

POLICY

Policy statements are important to an organisation because they help anchor the organisation on a core set of beliefs. These environmental guiding principles will enable all members of an organisation to focus on the same objective. They provide an opportunity for outside interests to understand the operation of the organisation. The policy should be focused, concise and easy to read. The environmental policy should address the following—

*	Compliance with legal requirements and voluntary commitments;

*	Minimising waste and preventing pollution;

*	Continual improvement in environmental performance, including areas not subject to regulations;

Sharing information on environmental performance with the community.

PLANNING

The planning should define the organisation’s environmental footprints and set goals. Goals and objectives should focus on maximising their positive impacts on the environment. When evaluating, the following elements should be considered—

*	Impacts on the environment through its activities, products and services;

*	Legal, requirements associated with protecting the environment;

*	Meaningful and focused environmental objectives and targets.

IMPLEMENTATIOMN AND OPERATION

Implementation and operation should define the activities that the organisation will perform to meet its environmental objectives and targets. This section should identify the activity each person is responsible for, ensure completion and set targets for each of the identified activity. In addition, this area should specify employee training, communication and outreach activities that are necessary to ensure successful implementation of the plan.

NINTH SCHEDULE—continued

CHECKING AND CORRECTIVE ACTION

The EMP should describe the process that will be followed to verify proper implementation and how problems will be corrected in a timely manner. Routine evaluation and continual improvement of the process is necessary to make sure that the plan successfully leads towards the completion of environmental objectives and targets,

MANAGEMENT REVIEW AND COMMITMENT TO IMPROVEMENT

Routine review and support by management is a necessary and meaningful tool for the organisation. This should identify the improvement that will be earned out to ensure that the plan is appropriately imple-mented to meet its environmental objectives.
