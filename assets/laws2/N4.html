3.	Objects of the Authority

Subject to this Act, the objectives of the Authority shall be to—

(a)	provide strategic public support for land development which presently constitutes a major infrastructural development bottleneck hindering the development of viable economic farm holdings;

(b)	promote and support optimum utilisation of Nigeria’s rural land resources for accelerated production of food and fibre;

(c)	encourage and support economic-size farm holdings and promote consolidation of scattered fragment holdings to generate net income from agriculture which is aimed at sustaining living standards above the poverty line and thereby narrow rural-urban income inequalities;

(d)	encourage the evolution of economic-size rural settlements that will reap the economies of

scale in the provision of social infrastructures;

(e) 	provide gainful employment opportunities for rural people, raise rural incomes and improve on the general living standards in rural areas;

(f) 	expand productive capacity in agriculture and regain export capability in traditional and non- traditional crops;

(g)	contribute significantly towards the attainment of a national food and fibre self-reliance, self- sufficiency and national food security through optimum utilisation of available abundant land resources which ensures minimum soil and environmental degradation, while simultaneously promoting sustainable agriculture;

(h)	facilitate appropriate cost-effective mechanisation of agriculture; and

(i) 	institute strategic land use planning schemes to deal with major allocation problems including the creation and location of forest and grazing reserves and other areas with restricted use, and the re-location of population, should this be necessitated by localised population explosion, pressure or national disasters.

4.	Tenure of office of members

(1)	The chairman of the Board shall hold office for a period of three years and shall be eligible for re-appointment for a further period of three years and no more.

(2)	Subject to the provisions of subsection (1) of this section, a member of the Board other than an ex-officio member shall, subject to the pleasure of the President, hold office for a period of three years from the date of his appointment and shall be eligible for re-appointment for a further term of three years and no more.

5.	Removal from office of members of the Board

k)	assist large scale farmers, where possible in the development of their lands; provided such services are on a commercial basis;
