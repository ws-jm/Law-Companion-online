(c)	briefly state the facts and grounds relied upon to sustain the complaint.

(2)	The complaint shall be divided into paragraphs each of which, as nearly as may be, shall be con-fined to a distinct portion of the subject, and every paragraph shall be numbered consequently and no costs shall be allowed for drawing up or copying any complaint not substantially in compliance with this provision, unless the Tribunal otherwise orders.

(7)	The form set out in Form B in the Appendix to this Schedule or one to the like effect, shall be sufficient for the purpose of the complaint.

[Form B.]

6.	Further particulars

Evidence need not be stated in the complaint, but the Tribunal may order such particulars as may be necessary, to prevent surprise and unnecessary expense and to ensure a fair and effectual hearing in the same way as in a civil action in the High Court, and upon such terms as to costs and otherwise, as may be ordered.

(3)	The proceedings under the complaint shall not be vitiated by the fact that the respondent may not have been served personally or that any document of which substituted service has been effected pursuant to an order made under sub-paragraph (2) of this paragraph did not reach the respondent’s hands; and in such circumstances as aforesaid, the proceedings may be heard and continued as if the respondent had been served personally with such document and shall be valid and effective for all purposes.

13.	Filing of reply

(1)	The respondent shall, within six days of entering an appearance, file in the Registry his reply, specifying therein which of the facts and grounds alleged in the complaint he admits or denies and setting out any facts and grounds on which he relies in opposition.

15.	Amendment of complaint

(1)	In relation to service of reply on other party, the amendment of a complaint, the provisions of the relevant provisions of the Civil Procedure Rules or the Civil Procedure Code, relating to amendment of pleading, shall apply as if for the words 'any proceeding' in those provisions there were substituted, the words 'the complaint or the reply if any”, provided that, after the expiry of the time limited by paragraph 2 of this Schedule for presenting the complaint, no amendment shall be made introducing any fresh request in the complaint, or effecting any alteration of substance in the request, or (saving anything which may be done under the provisions of sub-paragraph (2) of this paragraph), effecting any substantial alteration in or addition to the statement of facts and grounds relied upon to sustain the request.

(2)	The Tribunal, in the hearing and determination of the complaint, shall not be obliged to confine its inquiry or findings to the issues raised by the complaint and the reply, if any, and may with or without ordering or allowing—

(a)	the amendment of any statement of the facts and grounds relied upon in support of the complaint or the amendment or any admission or denial therein contained; or

(b)	the facts or grounds set out in the reply (but subject always and having due regard to the time limited by paragraph 2 of this Schedule, for presenting a complaint),

inquire into any other issue otherwise raised or apparent or any matter otherwise appearing, as the Tribunal may deem necessary, for the purpose of the full and proper determination of the complaint.

16.	Further particulars or direction

(1)	If any party to the complaint wishes to have further particulars or other directions of the Tribunal, he may, at any time after the entry of appearance, but no later than ten days after the filing of the reply, apply to the Tribunal, specifying in his notice of motion, the direction for which he prays and the motion shall, unless the Tribunal otherwise orders, be set down for hearing, on the first available day.

(3)	If a party does not so apply, he shall be taken to require no further particulars or other directions and such party shall be debarred from so applying after the lapse of the period laid down in sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph, except with the leave of the Tribunal, which may be given in a proper case on such terms as to cost and otherwise, as may be deemed fit.

23.	Adjournment

After the hearing has begun, if the inquiry cannot be continued on the ensuing day or, if such day is a Sunday or a public holiday, on the day following the same, the hearing shall not be adjourned sine die but to a definite day to be announced before the rising of the Tribunal, and notice of the day, to which the hearing is adjourned, shall forthwith be posted by the secretary on the Tribunal notice board.

24.	Powers of Tribunal over proceedings

(1)	All interlocutory questions and matters shall be heard and disposed of before the Tribunal which shall have control over the proceedings as a judge in the ordinary proceedings of the High Court.

(2)	After the hearing has been concluded, if the Tribunal before whom it was made has prepared its judgment, but the chairman of the Tribunal is unable to deliver it through illness or otherwise, the judgment may be delivered by a member of the Tribunal, as the judgment of the Tribunal; and the member shall certify the determination of the complaint to the Commission.

25.	Effect of determination

(1)	At the conclusion of the hearing, the Tribunal shall determine whether the census result complained of was valid or void and shall certify such determination to the Commission.

27.	Affidavit in support

(1)	Before leave for withdrawal of a complainant is granted, there shall be produced affidavits by all parties to the complaint and their solicitors, but the Tribunal may on cause shown, dispense with the affidavits of any particular person if it seems to the Tribunal on special grounds to be just to do so.

(2)	Each affidavit shall state that, to the best of the respondent’s knowledge and belief, no agreement of terms of any kind whatsoever has or have been made, and no undertaking has been entered into, in relation to the withdrawal of the complaint, but if any lawful agreement has been made with respect to the withdrawal of the complaint, the affidavit shall set forth that agreement and shall make the foregoing statement subject to what appears from the affidavit.

(3)	The affidavit of the applicant and his solicitor, if any, shall further state the ground on which the complaint is sought to be withdrawn.

31.	Countermand of notice of hearing

(1)	After receiving notice of the complainant’s intention to apply for leave to withdraw the complaint or of the death of the sole complainant, or the survivor of several complainants, or of the respondent’s intention not to oppose the complaint, if such notice is received after notice of hearing has been given and before the hearing has begun, the secretary shall forthwith countermand the notice of hearing.

(2)	The countermand shall be given in the same manner or, as near as may be, as the notice of hearing.

32.	Discretion of Tribunal if no reply

Where the respondent has not entered an appearance, or has not filed his reply within the prescribed time or within such time as the Tribunal may have allowed, or has given notice that he does not intend to oppose the complaint, then if—

(a) the complaint contains no request for a determination that the census result was void; or

(b) there are no facts or grounds stated in the complaint or in the reply, if any, or stated in any further particulars filed in the proceedings or otherwise appearing upon proof of which it ought to be determined that the census result was void,

the Tribunal may, if it thinks fit, determine the proceedings upon the complaint without hearing evidence or further evidence, and in any other case, the proceedings shall be contained and determined upon such evidence or otherwise as to the Tribunal may seem necessary for the full and proper determination of the complaint.

33.	Fees

(1) All costs, charges and expenses of and incidental to the presentation of a complaint and to the proceedings consequent thereon, with the exception of such as are otherwise provided for, shall be defrayed by the parties to the complaint, in such manner and in such proportions as the Tribunal may determine, regard being had—

(a)   to the disallowance of any costs, charges or expenses which may in the opinion of the Tribunal have been caused by vexatious conduct, unfounded allegations or unfounded objections on the part of either of the complainant or the respondent; and

(b)   to the discouragement of any needless expenses by throwing the burden of defraying the same on the parties by whom it has been caused, whether such parties are or are not on the whole successful.

(2) Where the Tribunal declares a census result to be void, the Tribunal may, if satisfied that the invalidity of the census result was due either wholly or in part to the culpable default of any officer responsible for the conduct of the census in the performance of his duties imposed by this Act, order that the whole or any part of the costs awarded to the successful complainant be paid by such officer.

35.	Return of security

Money deposited as security shall, when no longer needed as security for costs, charges or expenses, be returned to the person in whose name it is deposited or to any person entitled to receive the same by order of the Tribunal, which may be made upon motion after notice and proof that all just claims have been satisfied or otherwise sufficiently provided for as the Tribunal may require.

36.	Payment of costs out of security

(1)	The Tribunal may, on application made by a person to whom any costs, charges or expenses are payable, order the same to be paid out of any deposit made to secure the same, after notice to the party by or on whose behalf the deposit was made, requiring him to file a statement within a specified time whether he resists the application and the grounds of his opposition.

(2)	In the event of any dispute arising on any such application, the Tribunal shall afford every person affected thereby, an opportunity of being heard and make such order thereon, as may seem fit.

(3)	A person shall be deemed to have been afforded such opportunity, if notice of the time appointed for the inquiry into the dispute was given to him, though such person may not have been present at the making of the inquiry.

(4)	Any notice to be given to a person under this paragraph may be given by the secretary handing him the notice or sending it to him by registered letter—

(a)	in the case of a party, at the address for service;

(b)	in the case of the applicant for payment, at the address given in his application,

but these provisions shall not preclude the giving of notice in any other manner in which notice may be given or which may be authorised by the Tribunal.

(5)	Execution may be levied under any order for payment made by the Tribunal under this paragraph in the same manner and to the same extent as execution may be levied under a judgment for the payment of money.

37.	Calling of witness

(1)	On the hearing of a complaint, the Tribunal may summon any person as a witness, who appears to the Tribunal to have been concerned in the census.

(2)	The Tribunal may examine any witness so summoned or any person in the Tribunal although such witness or person is not called and examined by any party to the complaint, and thereafter he may be cross- examined by or on behalf of the complainant and the respondent.

(3)	The expenses of any witness called by the Tribunal of its own motion shall, unless the Tribunal otherwise orders, be deemed to be costs of the complaint and such expenses may, if the Tribunal so directs, be paid in the first instance by the secretary, in the same way as a State witness’s expenses and be recovered in such manner as the Tribunal may direct.

(4)	Where the Tribunal under this paragraph summons any person as a witness, the provisions of the relevant Civil Procedure Rules or of the Civil Procedure Code, relating to the expenses of persons ordered to attend a hearing, shall apply as if they were part of this paragraph.

38.	Privilege

(1) A person called as witness in any proceedings in the Tribunal under this Act, shall not be excused from answering any question relating to any offence at or connected with the census on the grounds that the answer thereto may incriminate or tend to incriminate himself, or on the grounds of privilege.

(2)	A witness who answers truly all questions which he is required by the Tribunal to answer, shall be entitled to receive a certificate of indemnity under the hand of the chairman of the Tribunal, stating that such witness has so answered.

(3)	An answer by a person to a question before the Tribunal shall not, except in the case of any criminal proceedings for peijury in respect of such evidence, be admissible in any proceedings civil or criminal in evidence against him.

(4)	When a person has received a certificate of indemnity in relation to a census and any legal proceedings are at any time brought against him for an offence against the provisions of this Act committed by him previously to the date of the certificate at or in relation to the said census, the Tribunal having cognisance of the case shall, on proof of the certificate, stay the proceedings and may, at its discretion, award to the said person such costs, as he may have been put to in the proceedings.

39.	Enlargement and abridgement of time

(1)	The Tribunal shall have power, subject to the provisions of paragraphs 2 and 15 of this Schedule, to enlarge or abridge the times appointed by this Act or the rules of court mentioned in paragraph 44 of this Schedule or fixed by any order enlarging time, for doing any act or taking any proceeding upon such terms (if any) as the justice of the case may require.

(2)	Enlargement may be ordered although the application for the same is not made until after the expiration of the time appointed or allowed.

(3)	When the time for delivering any pleading or document or filing any affidavit, answer or document, or doing any act is or has been fixed or limited by any of the paragraphs or rules aforesaid or by direction or order of the Tribunal, the costs of any application to extend such time and of any order made thereon, shall be borne by the party making such application, unless the Tribunal shall otherwise order.

(4)	An application for enlargement or abridgement of time, shall be supported by affidavit.

(5)	 An application for abridgement of time may be made ex parte, but the Tribunal may require notice thereof to be given to the other party.

(6)	An application for enlargement of time shall be made by motion after notice to the other party, but the Tribunal may, for good cause shown by affidavit or otherwise, dispose with such notice.

(7)	A copy of an order made for enlargement or abridgement of time, shall be filed or delivered to-gether with any document filed or delivered by virtue of the order.

40.	Service of notice

(1)	Where any summons, notice or document, other than a notice or document mentioned in para-graph 8 (1) of this Schedule is required to be served on any person for purpose connected with a complaint petition, the same may be served either by delivering it to such person or by leaving it at his last known place of abode, with any person there found who is a resident thereof and appears to be eighteen years of age or more.

(2)	After a party has given an address for service, it shall be sufficient if, in lieu of serving him personally with any document intended for him, such document is served—

(a)	on the person appearing on the paper last filed on his behalf as his solicitor wherever such person may be found or, if such person is not found at his office, on the clerk there apparently in charge; or

(b)	on the person named as occupier, if his address for service wherever such person may be found or, if such person is not found at such address on—

(i)	the person there found apparently in charge, if such address is a place of business; or

(ii)	any person other than a domestic servant there found who is a resident thereof and ap-pears to be eighteen years of age or more.

(3)	A party may change his address for service, by giving notice of his new address for service and its occupier to the secretary and to each other party; but until such notice is received by the secretary, his old address for service shall continue to be his address for service.

(4)	Where service on one of the foregoing modes has proved impracticable, the Tribunal, on being satisfied, upon an application supported by an affidavit showing what has been done, that all reasonable effort has been made to effect service, may order that service be effected in any of the ways mentioned in the provisions of the Civil Procedure Rules or Civil Procedure Code relating to substituted service shall be sufficient, or may dispense with service or notice, as the Tribunal may think fit.

41.	Multiple complaints

Where more complaints than one are presented in reaction to the same census result, all such complaints shall be considered and be dealt with as one complaint, unless the Tribunal shall otherwise direct.

42.	Duplicate of documents

In the absence of express provision for the furnishing of copies of duplicates of documents filed or used in connection with any step taken in the proceedings, the party taking such steps shall, unless the secretary otherwise directs, leave with the secretary a duplicate of every such document for each other party and three other duplicates.

43.	Non-compliance with rules, etc.

(1)	Non-compliance with any of the provisions of this Schedule, or with any rule of practice for the time being in force, shall not render any proceedings void, unless the Tribunal shall so direct, but such proceedings may be set aside either wholly or in part as irregular or amended, or otherwise dealt with in such manner and upon such terms, as the Tribunal shall think fit to ensure substantial justice.

(2)	No application to set aside any proceeding for irregularity shall be allowed, unless made within reasonable time, or if the party applying has taken any fresh step after knowledge of the irregularity.

(3)	Where an application is made to set aside proceedings for irregularity, the several objections in-tended to be insisted upon shall be stated in the notice of motion.

(4)	No objection shall be made that a certified copy has been used instead of a duplicate or a duplicate instead of a certified copy.

(5)	Complaint shall not be defeated by any objection merely as to form.

44.	Appeals

Appeal from a determination of the Tribunal shall be to the Court of Appeal and then to the Supreme Court.

45.	Application of Rules of Court

Subject to the express provisions of this Schedule, the practice and procedure of the Tribunal in relation to a complaint shall be assimilated as nearly as may be to the practice and procedure of the High Court in the exercise of its civil jurisdiction, and the Civil Procedure Rules or Civil Procedure Code shall apply with such modifications as may be necessary to render them conveniently applicable, as if the petitioner and the respondent were respectively the plaintiff and the defendant in a civil action.
