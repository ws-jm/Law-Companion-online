2003, the Nigerian Communications Commission hereby makes the following Regulations.

PART I

Rights and Obligations for Interconnection

1. A licensed telecommunications operator’s rights and obligations for interconnection

(1) A licensed telecommunications operator shall on receipt of a request for interconnection from another licensed telecommunications operator have an obligation to interconnect its telecommunica-tions network with that licensed telecommunications operator’s network in accordance with the princi-ples of section 97 of the Act, these Regulations and any guidelines on interconnection adopted by the Commission.

(2) A licensed telecommunications operator shall, for each number area for which it has been allo-cated numbers by the Commission within the range ascribed for fixed services in the national numbering plan, designate a minimum of one point of interconnection located in the geographic location of that number area in accordance with sub-regulations (1), (3) and (4).

(3) A point of interconnection shall be designated by notice in writing to the Commission setting out the location of that point of interconnection and details of the number area that it serves.

(4) Where a licensed telecommunications operator cannot, within (three months) from the date these Regulations take effect, designate a point of interconnection in a number area for which it has been allocated numbers, the licensed telecommunications operator shall designate on an interim basis for a limited period of not more than (three months) an existing point of interconnection located as close as possible to the geographic location of that number area as the designated point of interconnection for that number area and other areas, such interim designation to be made only with the prior approval of the Commission.

(5) The Commission may agree to limit the obligation required under sub-regulation (1) of this Regulation, if, as determined by the Commission in its reasonable discretion—

(a) an interconnection agreement is prohibited by law; or

(b) the licence issued to an operator does not authorise the services for which interconnection is requested; or

(c) the requested interconnection is rendered impossible as a result of technical specifications; or

(d) such interconnection would endanger life or safety or result in injury or harm to the licensed

telecommunications operator’s property or hinder the quality of the services provided by the licensed telecommunications operator.

(6) Any limitation imposed by the Commission pursuant to sub-regulation (5) of this Regulation shall be published in accordance with regulation 16 (1) of these Regulations.

2. Powers and functions of the commission with regards to interconnection

(1) The Commission shall—

(a) encourage and secure adequate interconnection and interoperability of services;

(b) carry out its functions in a way that promotes efficiency, sustainable competition and gives the maximum benefit to users;

(c) take all necessary measures to remove any restrictions which may prevent licensed telecom-munications operators from effectively negotiating interconnection agreements between themselves; and

(d) take all necessary measures to ensure that licensed telecommunications operators who re¬-

ceive information during the course of negotiations following a request for interconnection shall only use that information for the purpose for which it is given and that such information is not passed to any person to whom it may provide a competitive advantage.

(2) The Commission may—

(a) on its own initiative, intervene in negotiations on agreements for interconnection where no agreement is brought about between the negotiating parties within six weeks of the com-mencement of the negotiations;

(b) where the requested party is required to have in place a Reference Interconnection Offer on its own initiative or at the request of the party requesting interconnection, intervene in nego-tiations on agreements for interconnection after the expiry of a period of seven days from the date on which the requesting party has confirmed in writing to the requested party that it ac-cepts the terms and conditions set out in that Offer and where the requested party has not executed an interconnection agreement on expiry of that seven day period;

(c) on its own initiative and at any time or if requested by either party, set time limits within which negotiations on interconnection are to be completed which time limits shall be no more than six weeks unless the Commission in its reasonable discretion considers that a longer period is justified;

(d) also intervene if so requested by either party, in order to specify issues that shall be covered

in the interconnection agreement, which at a minimum may include the descriptions, terms and conditions included in the model interconnection offer as amended from time to time in accordance with regulation 2 (3) and require changes to be made to interconnection agree-ments already concluded.

(3) The Commission shall—

(a) following consultation with licensed telecommunications operators develop a set of service descriptions, terms and conditions for interconnection which shall be published as a Model Interconnection Offer and kept up to date by the Commission;

(b) amend the Model Interconnection Offer from time to time, following publication of a notice stating that the Commission intends to amend the Model Interconnection Offer, setting out the amendments and inviting comments on the amendments. Licensed telecommunications operators may establish a group to consider the Model Interconnection Offer and to propose to the Commission amendments to the Model Interconnection Offer. Where the Commission considers that as a result of any proposals made by the group, the Model Interconnection Of-fer should be amended, the Commission shall initiate the procedure described in this regula-tion 2 (3);

(c) consider, when intervening on its own initiative or at the request of one or both parties to a negotiation for interconnection, that, except where one of the parties is required to have in 

place a Reference Interconnection Offer, the Model Interconnection Offer forms the mini-mum set of service descriptions, terms and conditions that must be offered by the parties for the provision of interconnection to each other under an interconnection agreement; and

(d) when determining a dispute concerning the terms and conditions that should apply to interconnection arrangements between licensed telecommunications operators under these Regulations, consider the Model Interconnection Offer as forming the minimum set of service descriptions and terms and conditions that must be offered by the parties for the provision of interconnection to each other under an interconnection agreement, unless, at the Commission’s reasonable discretion, it considers that other service descriptions, terms or conditions should be imposed upon the parties.

(4) Where the agreement is not reached within the time allowed, the Commission shall in accordance with regulation 2 (2) above take steps to facilitate the conclusion of the interconnection agreement.

(a) meet all reasonable requests for access to its telecommunications network, in particular ac-cess at any technically feasible point on its telecommunications network; 

(b) adhere to the principle of non-discrimination with regard to interconnection offered to other licensed telecommunications operators, in particular, it shall apply similar conditions in simi-lar circumstances to interconnected licensed telecommunications operators providing similar services and provide interconnection facilities and information to other licensed telecommu-nications operators under the same conditions and of the same quality as it provides for its own services or those of the group of companies or partners;

(c) make available on request to other licensed telecommunications operators considering inter-connection with its telecommunications network, all information and specifications reasonably necessary in order to facilitate conclusion of an agreement for interconnection, including information on changes planned for implementation within the next six months, unless agreed otherwise by the Commission;

(d) submit to the Commission for approval and publish a Reference Interconnection Offer, suffi-ciently unbundled, giving description of the interconnection offerings broken down into components according to market needs and the associated terms and conditions including tariffs; and

(e) provide access to the technical standards and specifications of its telecommunications net-work with which another operator shall be interconnected.

(2) The Commission may impose or prohibit conduct by a dominant telecommunications operator, if the operator is violating the obligations imposed on it, and declare interconnection agreements wholly or partially invalid to the extent that such dominant telecommunications operator abuses its dominant position in the market.

(3) The Commission shall, before taking the action in sub-regulation (2) of this Regulation, first of all request the dominant telecommunications operator to refrain from the abuse to which the objection has been made.

11. The principles for interconnection charges and costing to be applied by dominant telecom-munications operators

(1) A dominant telecommunications operator shall, except where the Commission has determined interconnection rates, set charges for interconnection on objective criteria and observe the principles of transparency and cost orientation and the burden of proof that charges are derived from actual costs lies with the licensed telecommunications operator providing the interconnection service to its facilities.

(2) The Commission has the right to request that the dominant telecommunications operator justify fully its interconnection charges and where appropriate may request for the adjustment of the charges.

(3) The burden of proof that charges are derived from relevant costs, including a reasonable rate of return on investment, shall lie on the dominant operator providing interconnection in its facilities.

(4) The Commission has the right to request dominant operators to provide full justification for their interconnection charges and the dominant operators shall comply with any adjustment required by the Commission.

(5) The dominant operators may set different tariffs, terms and conditions for interconnection of different categories of telecommunications services where such differences can be objectively justified on the basis of the type of interconnection provided.

(6) The Commission shall ensure that the differences mentioned in sub-regulation (5) of this Regula-tion, do not result in the distortion of competition and in particular that the dominant operators apply the appropriate interconnection tariffs, terms and conditions when providing telecommunications for its own services or those of its subsidiaries or affiliates in accordance with the principle of non-discrimination.

(7) A dominant telecommunications operator shall—

(a) give written notice of any proposal to change any charges for interconnection services in accordance with the procedure set out in the guidelines on interconnection adopted by the Commission and the provisions of the operating licence;

(b) offer sufficiently unbundled charges for interconnection, so that the licensed telecommunica-tions operator requesting the interconnection is not required to pay for any item not strictly related to the service requested;

(i) in the opinion of the Commission is suitable to demonstrate that its charges for inter-connection have been fairly and properly calculated; and

(ii) provides any information requested by the Commission;

(d) make available to any person with a legitimate interest, on request, a description of its cost accounting system showing the main categories under which costs are grouped and the rules for the allocation of costs to interconnection and the Commission or any other competent body independent of the dominant telecommunications operator and approved by the Com-mission, shall verify compliance of the dominant telecommunications operator with the cost accounting system and the statement concerning compliance shall be published by the Com-mission annually.

12. Accounting separation and financial information

(1) If interconnection services are not provided through a structurally separated subsidiary, a domi-nant operator shall keep separate accounts as if the telecommunications activities in question were in fact carried out by legally independent companies, so as to identify all elements of cost and revenue with the basis of their calculation and the detailed attribution methods used.

(2) A dominant operator shall maintain separate accounts in respect of interconnection services and its core telecommunications services and the accounts shall be submitted for independent audit and thereafter published.

(3) A dominant operator shall supply financial information to the Commission promptly on request and to the level of detail required by the Commission.

(4) The Commission may publish such information in order to contribute to an open and competi-tive telecommunications market, while taking account of considerations of commercial confidentiality.

[S. I. 39 of 2007.]

In exercise of the powers conferred upon it by sections 70 and 90 of the Nigerian Communications Act, 2003 and of all other powers enabling it in that behalf, the Nigerian Communications Commission hereby makes the following Regulations.

[Date of commencement: 6th December, 2007]

PART I

Scope and Objectives

1. Scope of the Regulations

These Regulations are made to provide a regulatory framework for the promotion of fair competi-tion in the communications sector, and protection against the misuse of market power or other anti-competitive practices, pursuant to Part I of Chapter VI of the Act and all matters related thereto.

2. Objectives of the Regulations

These Regulations shall—

(a) provide further guidance on the standards and procedures which the Commission will apply in determining whether particular conduct constitutes substantial lessening of competition for the purposes of the Act;

(b) clarify what agreements or practices the Commission will find to be anti-competitive, and so prohibited under the Act;

(c) provide further guidance on the standards and processes which the Commission will apply in determining whether a Licensee has a dominant position in one or more communications markets;

(e) provide further guidance on the merger review procedures to be applied by the Commission.

3. Application of the Regulations

These Regulations apply to all Licensees and any other providers of communications services in Nigeria and Licensees shall remain subject to any conditions regarding anti-competitive conduct set out in their licenses.

PART II

Substantial Lessening of Competition

4. Applicable provisions of the Act

While the provisions of section 91 (1) of the Act prohibits Licensees from engaging in conduct which has the purpose or effect of substantially lessening competition in any aspect of the Nigerian communications market, section 91 (2) permits the Commission to publish guidelines or regulations from time to time which clarify the meaning of 'substantial lessening of competition' and section 92 (4) permits the Commission to direct any Licensee in a dominant position to cease conduct which has or may have the effect of substantially lessening competition in any communications market, and to implement appropriate remedies.

5. Guidance on substantial lessening of competition

The purpose of this Part of the Regulations is to provide guidance, regarding the standards and pro-cedures, which the Commission will apply in determining whether, particular conduct constitutes sub-stantial lessening of competition.

6. Considerations used in determining whether conduct constitute substantial lessening of com-petition

In accordance with the provision of section 91 (2) of the Act, which identifies market circumstances and other matters that might be included by the Commission in any guidelines or regulations with regard to the meaning of substantial lessening of competition' in assessing whether any conduct constitutes substantial lessening of competition, the Commission shall consider the—

(a) definition of the relevant market or markets (using the market analysis methodology de-scribed in Part IV of these Regulations);

(b) impact of the conduct on existing competitors in the identified markets;

(c) impact of the conduct on further market entry;

(d) impact of the conduct on consumers, including the availability and pricing of products and services; and

(e) degree of interference with competition that results in identifiable injury to competitors or consumers.

7. Considerations used with regard to regulation 6 (e)

In assessing whether a particular conduct meets the standard identified in regulation 6 (e), the Commission shall apply the following further considerations—

(a) a trivial or de minimise degree of lessening of competition will not be acted on by the Com-mission;

(b) the degree of market power of the Licensee (using the market definition and assessment of market power methodologies described in Part IV of these Regulations);

(c) a smaller degree of interference or injury resulting from the conduct of a Licensee with a large degree of market power (including Licensees found to be in a dominant position) which may be found to constitute substantial lessening of competition.

8. Conduct deemed to be substantial lessening of competition

Subject to a Licensee demonstrating otherwise in the course of any inquiry or other procedure con-ducted by the Commission, or in the course of an application pursuant to section 93 of the Act, the fol-lowing conduct or practices shall be deemed to result in a substantial lessening of competition—

(a) failing to supply interconnection or other essential facilities to a competing Licensee, in ac-cordance with any interconnection agreement between the parties or any direction, rule or order issued by the Commission pursuant to the Act or the Interconnection Regulations, ex-cept under circumstances that are objectively justified based on supply conditions, such as failure to supply, based on a shortage of available facilities;

(b) discriminating in the provision of interconnection or other communications services or facili-ties to competing Licensees, except under circumstances that are objectively justified based on supply conditions, such as discrimination based on differences in the costs of supply;

(c) bundling of communications services, whereby the Licensee in question requires, as a condi-tion of supplying a service to a competing Licensee, that the competing Licensee acquire an-other service that it docs not require;

(d) offering a competing Licensee more favourable terms or conditions that are not justified by cost differences, if it acquires another service that it does not require;

(e) pre-emptively acquiring or securing scarce facilities or resources, including rights of way, required by another Licensee for the operation of its business, with the effect of denying the use of the facilities or resources to the other service provider;

(f) supplying communications services, at prices below long run average incremental costs or

such other cost standard, as is adopted by the Commission;

(g) using revenues or the allocation of costs from one communications service to cross-subsidize another communications service, except where such cross subsidy is specifically approved by the Commission including, approval of tariffs or charges for the relevant communications services;

[S.I. No. 33 of 2007.]

(h) failing to comply with interconnection or facilities access obligations, including the Tele-communications Networks Interconnection Regulations, 2007, any other interconnection or access terms specified or approved by the Commission, or any interconnection or access re-lated decisions, directions or guidelines of the Commission;

(i) performing any of the following actions, where such actions have the effect of impeding or preventing a competing Licensee’s entry into, or expansion in, a communications market—

(i)  deliberately reducing the margin of profit available to a competing Licensee that re-quires 
wholesale communications services from the Licensee in question, by increasing the prices for the wholesale communications services required by that competing Licensee, or decreasing the prices of communications services in retail markets where they compete, or both; 

(ii) requiring or inducing a supplier to refrain from selling to a competing Licensee;

(iii) adopting technical specifications for networks or systems to deliberately prevent in-terconnection or interoperability with a network or system of a competing Licensee;

(iv) failing to make available to competing Licensees on a timely basis, technical specifi-cations, information about essential facilities, or other commercially relevant infor-mation which is required by such competing Licensees to provide communications services and which is not available from other sources; and

(v) using information obtained from competing Licensees, for purposes related to inter-connection or the supply of communications facilities or services by the Licensee in question, to compete with such competing Licensees; and

(j) any failure by a Licenses to comply with any decision, rule, direction or guideline issued by the Commission, regarding either, prohibited or required competitive practices.

(2) In determining whether a Licensee is in a dominant position, the Commission may, consider a range of market circumstances or criteria, but shall consider one or more of the following—

(a) the market share of the Licensee, determined by reference to revenues, numbers of subscrib-ers or volumes of sales;

(b) the overall size of the Licensee in comparison to competing Licensees, particularly any re-sulting economies of scale or scope that permit the larger Licensee to produce products or services at lower costs;

(c) control of network facilities or other infrastructure, access to which is required by competing Licensees and that cannot, for commercial or technical reasons, be duplicated by competing Licensees;

(d) the absence of buying power or negotiating position by customers or consumers, including substantial barriers to switching service providers;

20. Presumption of dominant position

Subject to any other determination of the Commission under this Part, or to any demonstration by a Licensee in the specific circumstances that the presumption should not apply, the Commission will pre-sume that any Licensee whose gross revenues in a specific communications market exceed forty per cent of the total gross revenues of all Licensees in that market, is in a dominant position in that market

21. Determination of j oint dominant position

In addition to determining that an individual Licensee is in a dominant position, the Commission may also determine that two or more Licensees, acting jointly or collectively, are in a dominant position, including, where the Licensees have no common ownership, are not parties to any formal- agreement or operate in different markets.

SCHEDULE

Examples of Numbers and Blocks

1. These examples are based on the National Numbering Plan as published at the time of preparation of these Regulations.

2. In these Regulations, the trunk prefix is not regarded as part of the Number, Doing this is both convenient for the definitions in the Regulations and consistent with the recommendations of the International Telecommunication Union, In consequence, a customer dialing 012691531 in Nigeria is using the Number 12691531 with the trunk prefix 0. In the current implementation of the National Numbering Plan, this Number actually identifies the Lagos area (‘ I ’), the Ikoyi exchange (‘269’ and one line out of ten thousand (10,000) lines that have been assigned to this part of Lagos. In the terminology of these Regulations, there is a Block that has 1269 as its Code and 10,000 as its Size. It contains all the Numbers between its least Number,”12690000 (= 1269 x 10,000), and its greatest Number, 12699999 (= 1269 x 10,000 + 10,000-1). It has assigned as its Allocation Status (because it has been assigned to a Licensee for use in that part of Lagos).

3. A customer dialling 01732531 in Nigeria is using the Number 1732531 with the trunk prefix 0. In the current implementation of the National Numbering Plan, this Number actually identifies the Lagos area (‘I’), the Bagadry exchange (‘732’) and one line out of one thousand (1,000) lines that have been assigned to this part of Lagos. In the terminology of these Regulations, there is a Block that has 1732 as its Code and 1,000 as its Size. It contains all the Numbers between its least Number, 1732000 (= 1732 x 1,000), and its greatest Number, 1732999 (= 1732 x 1,000 + 1,000-1). It has Assigned as its Allocation Status (because it has been assigned to a Licensee for use in that part of Lagos).

4. According to the National Numbering Plan, in this part of Lagos other Blocks could be assigned but have not been assigned yet. For instance, the Block containing all the Numbers between 1734000 (= 1734 x 1,000), and its greatest Number, 1734999 (= 1734 x 1,000 + 1,000-1) has 1734 us its Code and 1,000 as its Size. It has assignable as its Allocation Status (because it could be assigned to a Licensee for use in that part of Lagos but has not been assigned).

5. The Blocks mentioned so far have Usage Condition, that restrict the geographic areas for receiving calls or messages (to Lagos or parts of Lagos). However, some Blocks in the National Numbering Plan do not have Usage Conditions like these. In particular, this is so for the Block containing all the Numbers between 8040000000 (= 804 x 10,000,000) and 8049999999 (= 804 x 10,000,000 + 10,000,000-1), which has 804 as its Code, 10000000 as its Size and Assigned as its Allocation Status.

6. Some Blocks have not yet been given purposes; an example is the Block containing all the Numbers between 8000000000 (= 800 x 10,000,000) and 8009999999 (= 800 x 10,000,000 + 10,000,000-1), which has 800 as its Code and 10000000 as its Size, In many countries a Block having this Code is used for free phone services. Possibly in Nigeria this Block should have expected to Become Assignable as its Allocation Status, with the expectation that in due course it would be used for free phone services, it would then have a Usage Condition that would restrict the charges for calls or messages (as calls and messages would be free). However, the use of the Block for free phone, or any other services might be confusing because of the similarity between its Code and the Codes for mobile telephone numbers, in that ease the Block should have Unusable as its Allocation Status. Until the purpose of the Block is determined it should have retained as its Allocation Status.

7. As these examples show, Blocks can have very different sizes. Assignments can split them into other Blocks, some of which have Assigned as their Allocation Status and some of which have Assignable as their Allocation Status. Blocks are intended just for ease of description, assignment and routing. In fact, a Block could be any set of consecutive Numbers that has a suitable Code and a suitable Size, provided that there is one Allocation Status and the same Usage Conditions throughout the set.

8. The international Telecommunication Union calls a telephone number such as 12691531 (without the trunk prefix) a 'National (Significant) Number”. However, telephone numbers are not the only Numbers in the terminology of these Regulations. In particular, short codes for fixed telephones and mobile telephones are also Numbers.

9. Short codes are often assigned individually. In such cases they correspond to Blocks that have 1 as their Size. For instance, the national emergency number given in the National Numbering Plan, 115, can be regarded as the Block containing all the Numbers between 115 (= 115 x 1) and 115 (= 115 x 1+1-1), which has 115 as its Code and 1 as its Size.

10. Nonetheless some short codes have in effect been assigned in larger Blocks. For instance, in the Na-tional Numbering Plan one set of short codes intended for prepaid and internet services is the Block containing all the Numbers between 15,000 (= 15 x 1,000) and 15999 (= 15 x 1,000 + 1,000-1), which has 15 as its Code and 1,000 as its Size. A customer dialling 15999 in Nigeria can gain access to a prepaid calling card service and can then dial, say, 012691531 (possibly preceded by a Personal Identification Number). In such respects, a prepaid calling card service number is like a carrier selection code that in many countries would be used for call-by-call selection of the trunk network.

11. The same national emergency number should be usable on all access networks. By contrast, a prepaid calling card service number might be usable only on a particular access network. The Block containing the prepaid calling card service number would then have a Usage Condition that restricts which networks were required to route traffic to and from it. Such a Usage condition would he inappropriate for a Block containing telephone numbers (as opposed to short codes), because telephone numbers are intended to be usable on all access networks.
