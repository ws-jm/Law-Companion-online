[No. 37 of 1967.]

4.	Omission or irregularity as to oath, etc.

(1)	Nothing in this Act shall render, or be deemed to render or be deemed to have rendered invalid any act done or which hereafter may be done by a public officer in the execution or intended execution of his official duties, by reason only of the omission by the public officer to take any oath or to make any affirmation which the officer should take or should have taken or should make or should have made:

Provided that any person who declines, neglects, or omits to take the required oath or make the required affirmation under this Act shall—

8.	Affirmations

Any person who objects to the taking of an oath and desires to make an affirmation in lieu thereof, may do so without being questioned as to the grounds of such objection or desire, or otherwise, and in any such case the form of the required oath shall be varied by the substitution for the words or swearing, the words, 'I solemnly, sincerely, and truthfully affirm that....”; and such other consequential variations of form as may be necessary shall thereupon be made:

Anything to the contrary in this Act notwithstanding, if it appears to a court or officer before whom an oath other than a promissory oath is to be taken or affirmation other than a promissory affirmation is to be made, that the person about to take the oath or make the affirmation ought not, by reason of immature age or for any other sufficient cause, to be allowed to take the oath or make the affirmation as aforesaid, it shall be lawful for the court or officer, if the court or officer shall in its or his free discretion so think fit, to allow such person, in lieu of taking the oath or making the affirmation, to give evidence or make a declaration without oath or affirmation and in any such case the court or officer shall enter in the minutes of the proceedings or on the instrument or document concerned, as the case may be, a note of the fact of the evidence or declaration having been given or made without oath or affirmation, and of the reasons therefor:

Provided that, if any person declining or objecting to take an oath is, in the opinion of the court or officer as the case may be, competent to make an affirmation, such person shall, on the court or officer so directing him, thereupon make an affirmation as provided by section 8 of this Act.
