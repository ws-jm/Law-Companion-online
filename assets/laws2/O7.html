PART I

Preliminary

1.	Short title and extent

This Act may be cited as the Oil Pipelines Act and shall apply throughout the Federation.

2.	Interpretation

In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires—

'licence' means an oil pipeline licence granted under the provisions of this Act;

'Minister' means the Minister charged with responsibility for matters relating to oilfields and oil mining;

(2)	Every application for a permit to survey shall specify the approximate route or alternative routes proposed.

(3)	The Minister may—

(a)	grant the permit to survey on payment of the fees required by section 31 of this Act to be paid by the applicant on the submission of the application and on grant of the permit to survey respectively; or

(4)	If the Minister refuses to grant the permit to survey he shall notify the applicant in writing of such refusal and the reasons therefor.

5.	Effect of permit to survey

(1)	A permit to survey shall entitle the holder, subject to the provisions of section 6 of this Act, to enter together with his officers, agents, workmen or other servants and with any necessary equipment or vehicles, on any land upon the route specified in the permit or reasonably close to such route for the following purposes—

(a)	to survey and take levels of the land;

and shall entitle the holder, with such persons, equipment or vehicles as aforesaid, to pass over land adjacent to such route to the extent that such may be necessary or convenient for the purpose of obtain-ing access to land upon the route specified.

(2)	The Minister may, upon application by the holder of a permit to survey, vary the route specified in such permit, but such variation shall not invalidate or make illegal any act done by the holder pursuant to the permit prior to such variation, nor prejudice the rights of any person under this Act with reference to any act done by the holder pursuant to the permit prior to such variation.

6.	Notice before entry, damage, compensation, etc.

(1)	Except with the previous consent of the owner or occupier, no person shall under the authority of section 5 of this Act enter any building or upon any enclosed court or garden attached to any building, without previously having given the owner or occupier at least fourteen days’ notice of his intention to do so, nor enter upon any cultivated land without having given such notice to the owners or occupiers thereof or having affixed such notice in some prominent position upon such land.

11.	Rights and obligations of the holder of a licence

(1)	A licence shall entitle the holder, his officers, agents, workmen or other servants with any nec-essary equipment or vehicles, subject to the provisions of sections 14, 15 and 16 of this Act, to enter upon, take possession of or use a strip of land of a width not exceeding 200 feet or of such other width or widths as may be specified in the licence upon the route specified in the licence, and thereon thereover or thereunder to construct, maintain and operate an oil pipeline and ancillary installations.

(2)	For the purpose of this Act, an oil pipeline means a pipeline for the conveyance of mineral oils, natural gas and any of their derivatives or components, and also any substance (including steam and water) used or intended to be used in the production or refining or conveying of mineral oils, natural gas, and any of their derivatives or components.

(3)	The power to construct, maintain and operate an oil pipeline shall include a power to construct, maintain and operate on the route of such pipeline all other installations (referred to in this Act as 'an-cillary installations”) that are ancillary to the construction, maintenance and operation of such pipeline, including roadways, telephone and telegraph lines (subject to section 4 of the Telegraphs Act), electric power cables (subject to the provisions of the Electricity Act), pumping stations, storage tanks and loading terminals.

[Cap. M12.]

(5)	The holder of a licence shall pay compensation—

(a)	to any person whose land or interest in land (whether or not it is land in respect of which the licence has been granted) is injuriously affected by the exercise of the right conferred by the licence, for any such injurious affection not otherwise made good; and

(b)	to any person suffering damage by reason of any neglect on the part of the holder or his agents, servants or workmen to protect, maintain or repair any work, structure or thing exe-cuted under the licence, for any such damage not otherwise made good; and

Provided that where the Minister thinks fit, the Minister may approve in respect of minor deviations an agreement reached between the holder of the licence and any person or persons whose land or interest in land may be injuriously affected by such minor deviations.

(3)	The grant of the right to make a deviation under this section shall not invalidate or make illegal any act done by the holder of the licence prior to such grant, nor prejudice the rights of any person under this Act with reference to any act done by the holder prior to such grant.

without the prior permission in writing of the Minister or of such officer as may be nominated by the Minister.

15.	Restrictions upon entry in respect of venerated land

Provided that it shall not be necessary to make good any interruption in respect of which com-pensation under this Act has been paid:

Provided further that upon accommodation works being provided in accordance with the provi-sions of this section no further accommodation works shall be necessary in respect of any change of use of any land or deviation of any track or path or any other act or omission of any person not being the holder of the licence or his agent, workman or servant.

(2)	The holder of a licence may for the purpose of exercising the powers conferred upon him, alter the level or position of any pipe, conduit, watercourse, drain, or electric, telephone or telegraph wire or post, but shall give reasonable notice of his intention so to do to the person in control thereof and shall execute the work to the reasonable satisfaction of that person.

(3)	Where there is a danger that a tree standing near an oil pipeline may fall and damage such pipeline or an ancillary installation, the holder of the licence may after giving notice to an administrative officer having responsibility in the area, fell the tree or otherwise deal with it, and in such event shall upon application by any person interested in the tree pay such compensation as such officer shall consider necessary.

17.	Terms and conditions of licences

(1)	A licence may be granted for such period not exceeding twenty years as the Minister may direct.

18.	Use of oil pipeline by a person other than the owner

(1)	An application may be made to the Minister with respect to an oil pipeline constructed, main-tained and operated in pursuance of a licence granted under this Act by any person other than the owner of the pipeline who seeks a right to have conveyed by the pipeline on his behalf any of the things men-tioned in subsection (2) of section 11 of this Act which the pipeline is designed to convey.

(2)	Every such application shall be made in the prescribed manner and form containing the prescribed particulars.

(3)	The Minister shall consider every such application in consultation with the applicant and the owner of the pipeline to which the application relates.

(4)	If upon such consideration the Minister is satisfied that the pipeline could, without prejudice to the proper and efficient operation thereof for the purpose of the conveyance on behalf of the owner, in the quantity required by him, of the thing which it is designed to convey, be so operated as to permit of the conveyance thereby on behalf of the applicant of the thing the right to the conveyance of which is sought by the applicant, the Minister shall declare that he is so satisfied.

(5)	Subject to the subsequent provisions of this section, the conditions of the use of the pipeline by the applicant may be determined by agreement between the owner and the applicant and, failing such agreement, shall, subject as aforesaid, be determined by the Minister.

(6)	Where the Minister makes under subsection (4) of this section a declaration with regard to a pipeline, he may by notice served on the owner impose such requirements as he thinks it necessary or expedient to impose for all or any of the following purposes, namely—

(a)	securing to the person whose application resulted in the making of the declaration the right to have conveyed by the pipeline the thing to which the application is related;

(b)	regulating the charge to be made for the conveyance of such thing by the pipeline on behalf of that person;

(c)	securing that the exercise of a right secured by virtue of paragraph (a) of this subsection is not prevented or impeded,

but requirements imposed for the purpose specified in paragraph (a) of this subsection shall be so framed as, in the Minister’s opinion, to secure that compliance therewith will not prejudice the proper and efficient operation of the pipeline for the purpose of the conveyance on behalf of the owner thereof, in the quantity required by him, of the thing which it is designed to convey.

(7)	A notice served on the owner of a pipeline under subsection (6) may authorise such owner to recover, from the person to whom a right is secured by the notice by virtue of paragraph (a) of that sub-section, payments of such amounts as may be determined in accordance with provisions in that behalf contained in the notice, being payments in consideration of the rights being secured to such person.

(8)	If the owner of a pipeline fails to comply with a requirement imposed by a notice served on him under subsection (6) of this section with reference to the pipeline, he is guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding N1,000; and, if the failure continues after his conviction he is guilty of a further offence and liable, in respect thereof, to a fine not exceeding fifty naira for each day on which the failure continues.

(9)	The Minister may by notice to the owner of a pipeline whose failure to comply with any such requirement as aforesaid continues after his conviction of a first offence under subsection (8) of this section revoke the licence of such owner.

PART IV

Compensation

19.	Court having jurisdiction as to compensation

If there be any dispute as to whether any compensation is payable under any provision of this Act or if so as to the amount thereof, or as to the persons to whom such compensation should be paid, such dispute shall be determined by a magistrate exercising civil jurisdiction in the area concerned if such magistrate has in respect of any other civil matter monetary jurisdiction of at least as much as the amount of compensation claimed, and if there be no such magistrate, by the High Court exercising jurisdiction in the area concerned and, notwithstanding the provisions of any other Act or law, in respect of the decision of a magistrate in accordance with this section there shall be an appeal to the High Court of the State and in respect of a decision of the High Court of the State under this section, whether original or appellate, there shall be an appeal to the Court of Appeal:

Provided that nothing in this Act shall be deemed to confer power upon a magistrate to exercise jurisdiction in a matter raising any issue as to the title to land or as to the title to any interest in land.

20.	Basis of assessment of compensation

(1)	If a claim is made under section 6 (3) of this Act, the court shall award such compensation as it considers just in respect of any damage done to any buildings, crops or profitable trees by the holder of the permit in the exercise of his rights thereunder and in addition may award such sum in respect of disturbance (if any) as it may consider just.

(2)	If a claim is made under section 11 (5) of this Act, the court shall award such compensation as it considers just, having regard to—

(a)      any damage done to any buildings, crops or profitable trees by the holder of the licence in the exercise of the rights conferred by the licence; and

(b)	any disturbance caused by the holder in the exercise of such rights; and

(c)	any damage suffered by any person by reason of any neglect on the part of the holder or his agents, servants or workmen to protect, maintain or repair any work, structure or thing exe-cuted under the licence; and

(d)	any damage suffered by any person (other than as stated in such subsection (5) of this sec-tion) as a consequence of any breakage of or leakage from the pipeline or an ancillary instal-lation; and

(e)	loss (if any) in value of the land or interests in land by reason of the exercise of the rights as aforesaid,

and also having regard to any compensation already awarded in accordance with subsection (1) of this section.

(3)	In determining the loss in value of the land or interests in land of a claimant the court shall assess the value of the land or the interests injuriously affected at the date immediately before the grant of the licence and shall assess the residual value to the claimant of the same land or interests consequent upon and at the date of the grant of the licence and shall determine the loss suffered by the claimant as the difference between the values so found, if such residual value is a lesser sum.

(4)	No compensation shall be awarded in respect of unoccupied land as defined in the Land Use Act, except to the extent and in the circumstances specified in that Act.

[Cap. L5.]

(5)	In determining compensation in accordance with the provisions of this section the court shall apply the provisions of the Land Use Act so far as they are applicable and not in conflict with anything in this Act as if the land or interests concerned were land or interests acquired by the President for a public purpose.

(6)	If the total sum awarded by the court in accordance with this section exceeds an amount already offered to the claimant by the holder of the licence the court may order such holder to pay the costs of the proceedings; and if the sum so awarded does not exceed the amount offered by such holder the court shall either order the claimant to pay the cost of the proceedings or order each side to bear its own costs.

(7)	Compensation (if any) awarded by the court in accordance with this section shall be a sum of money payable forthwith or shall consist of periodical instalments or partly one and partly the other:

Provided that nothing contained in this subsection shall preclude the court awarding additional compensation upon subsequent application if loss or damage from the operation of the oil pipeline be proved and the court is of opinion that such loss or damage is loss or damage not contemplated at the date of the original award.

21.	Compensation where local community interested

Where the interests injuriously affected are those of a local community, the court may order the compensation to be paid to any chief, headman or member of that community on behalf of such com-munity or that it be paid in accordance with a scheme of distribution approved by the court or that it be paid into a fund to be administered by a person approved by the court on trust for application to the general, social or educational benefit and advancement of that community or any section thereof.

22.	Parties in possession as owners to be deemed entitled to lands

If any question arises respecting the title to the lands affected under this Act, the parties in posses-sion as being the owners thereof, or in receipt of the rents of such lands as being entitled thereto at the time of service of notice under section 6 or 8 of this Act, as the case may be, shall be deemed to have been lawfully entitled to such lands, unless the contrary be shown to the satisfaction of the court, and they and all parties claiming under them or consistently with their possession shall be deemed entitled to any compensation payable under this Act, but without prejudice to any subsequent proceedings against such parties at the instance of any person claiming to have a better right thereto.

23.	Exoneration upon payment

The payment to any person to whom any compensation shall be paid or the payment into court of any compensation upon a decision of the court shall effectually discharge the person making such payment from seeing to the application or being answerable for the misapplication thereof:

Provided that where any person is in possession of any land affected by the provisions of this Act by virtue of any estate less than an estate of inheritance, or where any person is in possession thereof in any fiduciary or representative character, the compensation may be paid to such person and in such proportions and instalments and after such notices as the court may direct.

PART V

Miscellaneous

24.	Proceedings where possession of land withheld

If any person hinders or obstructs any person duly authorised in accordance with the provisions of this Act from entering upon or taking possession of or using any lands in pursuance of this Act, the per-son so hindered or obstructed may apply ex parte at any time to the High Court exercising jurisdiction in the area for a writ of possession and such court may issue a writ of possession addressed to the sheriff under which any officer of the sheriff or police officer may forthwith eject any person so withholding possession.

25.	Penalty for hindering the taking possession of lands, etc.

Every person who shall wilfully hinder or obstruct any person duly authorised from entering upon or taking possession of or using any land in pursuance of the provisions of this Act, or who shall molest, hinder or obstruct such person when in possession of such lands, or shall hinder or obstruct any officer of the sheriff or police officer when executing a writ of possession, shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine of N50 or to imprisonment for three months.

26.	Deviation when land required for public purposes

It shall be lawful for the Minister to require deviation of the route of an oil pipeline so far as it affects any land required for a public purpose by the Government of the Federation or the Government of a State upon such terms as to compensation, or otherwise, as shall be agreed with the holder, or failing such agreement, as may be arrived at by arbitration.

27.	Effect of breach of terms or conditions

(1)	If there shall be a breach of any of the terms or conditions upon which a licence has been granted, the Minister may by notice in writing require the holder of the licence to remedy such breach within such period, being not less than three months, as may be specified in such notice.

(2)	If the holder of the licence shall fail within the period so specified to remedy such breach the Minister may by notice to the holder revoke the said licence, without prejudice to anything lawfully done thereunder and without prejudice to any claims for compensation against the holder made in accordance with the provisions of this Act.
