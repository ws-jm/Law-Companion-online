CHAPTER 08

OIL TERMINAL DUES ACT

An Act to provide for the levying and payment of terminal dues on any ship evacuating oil at any terminal in any port in Nigeria, and in respect of any services provided at those ports, and for all other matters connected therewith.

[No. 9 of 1969.]

[Date of commencement: 1st January, 1965]

1.	Levy of terminal dues, etc.

(1)	As from the date of commencement of this Act, terminal dues may be levied, subject to the pro-visions of this Act and the Nigerian Ports Authority Act, on any ship evacuating oil at any oil terminal and in respect of any services or facilities provided under this Act.

[Cap. N126.]

(2)	The following persons shall be liable to pay any terminal dues levied pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, that is—

(a)	the master or owner of the ship;

(b)	every consignor or agent who shall have paid or made himself liable to pay any dues on account of such ship,

but, when any terminal dues are paid by any person who is not the master or owner of the ship, that person may retain, out of monies in his hands received on account of such ship or her owner, the amount of the dues paid by him together with reasonable expenses incurred by reason of such payment or liability.

(3)	The master of any ship arriving in, or applying for the clearance of a ship outwards from an oil terminal shall produce to the Nigerian Ports Authority—

(a)	the ship’s register and the ship’s papers;

(b)	a list containing the name of the consignee of the oil intended to be evacuated; and

(c)	such other particulars as the Authority may require, including the kind and quantity of oil to be evacuated and the particulars required in the foregoing provisions of this subsection shall be delivered to such officer of the Authority and on such forms as may be prescribed.

(4)	The Authority may either alone or with any other person enter into any ship evacuating oil in order to ascertain the dues payable in respect of the ship and may for that purpose determine the quantity of the oil in respect of which terminal dues are to be paid and may, if necessary, detain such ship until the dues have been ascertained or the quantity of the oil otherwise determined.

(5)	Where the quantity of oil determined in accordance with subsection (4) of this section is more than that shown by the particulars delivered in accordance with subsection (3) of this section, the expenses incurred in determining the amount of oil shall be paid to the Authority by the master of the ship, and shall be recoverable in the same manner as dues leviable under this section.

(6)	Where the master of any ship in respect of which any terminal dues are payable refuses or ne-glects to pay such dues on demand, the provisions of sections 75 to 77 of the Nigerian Ports Authority Act (which provide the remedies for the recovery of dues) or such provisions as may be prescribed shall apply in relation to the recovery of terminal dues payable under this section as they apply in relation to the recovery of dues and rates payable under Part XI of that Act.

[Cap. N126.]

2.	Provision of navigational services and facilities

(1)	It shall be the duty of the Authority to provide such navigational services or extend such facilities for the purposes of this Act as may be necessary or expedient to serve the public interest in accordance with the requirements of the provisions of the Convention.

(2)	Such navigational services may include the installation of position-fixing system, navigational aids, and the setting up of sea lanes for the purposes of removing any navigational hazards.

(3)	In this subsection—

(a)	'position-fixing system' means such system of hyperbolic navigation which operates auto-matically and continuously and which depends on time signals sent out from a series, that is to say, chains of master and slave stations, for the purpose of enabling any mariner to obtain the position of his ship and of aiding navigation, with a very high degree of accuracy; and

(b)	'navigational aids' include objects on shore or afloat or instruments, such as light-houses, lightships, buoys, beacons, radio/radar and radar equipment, which assist in the safe passage of ships or enable ships to ascertain their positions at sea in relation to these aids.

(4)	The facilities which the Authority may provide may include berthing, towing, mooring, or moving of ships in or around any oil terminal for the purposes of evacuating oil from the terminal including the establishment of safety zones, and the Authority may in respect of such services, levy ships’ dues on such ships.

(5)	Sections 7 and 8 of the Nigerian Ports Authority Act (which relate to the duties of the Authority) shall apply and shall be construed with such modifications as may be necessary, and notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, the references in those provisions to 'navigational services' and 'port facilities' are references to the services and facilities prescribed under the foregoing provisions of this section.

[Cap. N126.]

3.	Application of certain other provisions of the Nigerian Ports Authority Act

Subject to the provisions of this Act, the provisions of the Nigerian Ports Authority Act specified in Column 1 of the First Schedule of this Act shall apply in relation to any oil terminal and to the extent mentioned in Column 3 of that Schedule as they apply in relation to a port or any approaches thereto, and as if references in that Act to 'a port or any approaches thereto' were references to an 'oil terminal or any area within which the terminal is situated”.

[Cap. N126. First Schedule.]

4.	Appointment or designation of officers, etc., of the Authority

The Authority may for the purposes of this Act appoint or designate any officer, servant or agent of the Authority for the purposes of discharging any of its functions under this Act.

5.	Power to apply or extend regulations made under the Nigerian Ports Authority Act

The Minister may by regulations extend any regulations made by the Minister or by the Authority under the Nigerian Ports Authority Act for the maintenance, control and management of anything to which the Act relates and in particular, apply section 71 of the Nigerian Ports Authority Act (which relates to the power of the authority to make regulations for the levy of dues and rates) or extend any regulations made pursuant to that section for the purposes of this Act, and any regulations as so extended or applied shall be of the same effect as if made under this Act.

[Cap. N126.]

6.	Discharge of oil at an oil terminal

(1)	So much of section 3 of the Oil in Navigable Waters Act as relates to the discharge of oil or mixture containing oil into the territorial waters of Nigeria from any vessel or apparatus used for transferring oil to any vessel shall, subject to the following provisions of this section, apply in relation to the area within which any oil terminal is situated, if situated outside the limits of the territorial waters, as they apply in relation to the whole of the sea within the seaward limits of the territorial waters.

[Cap. 06.]

(a)       from a pipeline or any apparatus used for the purposes of transferring oil from or to a vessel;

(b)	from a vessel; or

(c)	as a result of any operation for evacuating oil,

the owner of the pipeline or the owner of the vessel or the person in charge of the operation, as the case may be, is guilty of an offence under section 3 of the Oil in Navigable Waters Act (as applied by this section).

[Cap. 06.]

(3)	Any person found guilty of an offence as aforesaid shall on conviction be liable to the same penalty as provided by section 6 of the Oil in Navigable Waters Act and the special defences prescribed under section 4 thereof shall apply in relation to such offences as they apply for the purposes of that Act.

(4)	The operation of the foregoing provisions of this section is without prejudice to the operation of any other provision of the Oil in Navigable Waters Act in so far as it applies in relation to any area within which there is situated any oil terminal, and effect shall be given to the provisions of that Act, accordingly.

(5)	In this section, 'oil' has the meaning given in section 20 of the Oil in Navigable Waters Act.

SECOND SCHEDULE

[Section 11.]

Convention on the Continental Shelf The States Parties to this Convention have agreed as follows—

ARTICLE 1

For the purpose of these articles, the term 'continental shelf’ is used as referring—

(a)	to the seabed and subsoil of the submarine areas adjacent to the coast but outside the area of the territorial sea, to a depth of 200 metres or, beyond that limit, to where the depth of the superjacent waters admits of the exploitation of the natural resources of the said areas;

(b)	to the seabed and subsoil of similar submarine areas adjacent to the coasts of islands.

ARTICLE 2

1.	The coastal State exercises over the continental shelf sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring it and exploiting its natural resources.

2.	The rights referred to in paragraph 1 of this article are exclusive in the sense that if the coastal State does not explore the continental shelf or exploit its natural resources, no one may undertake these activities, or make a claim to the continental shelf, without the express consent of the coastal State.

3.	The rights of the coastal State over the continental shelf do not depend on occupation, effective or no-tional, or on any express proclamation.

4.	The natural resources referred to in these articles consist of the mineral and other non-living resources of the seabed and subsoil together with living organisms belonging to sedentary species, that is to say, organisms which, at the harvestable stage, either are immobile on or under the seabed or are unable to move except in constant physical contact with the seabed or the subsoil.

ARTICLE 3

The rights of the coastal State over the continental shelf do not affect the legal status of the superjacent waters as high seas, or that of the airspace above those waters.

ARTICLE 4

Subject to its right to take reasonable measures for the exploration of the continental shelf and the exploitation of its natural resources, the coastal State may not impede the laying or maintenance of submarine cables or pipelines on the continental shelf.

ARTICLE 5

1.	The exploration of the continental shelf and the exploitation of its natural resources must not result in any unjustifiable interference with navigation, fishing or the conservation of the living resources of the sea, nor result in any interference with fundamental oceanographic or other scientific research carried out with the intention of open publication.

2.	Subject to the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 6 of this article, the coastal State is entitled to construct and maintain or operate on the continental shelf installations and other devices necessary for its exploration and the exploitation of its natural resources and to establish safety zones around such installations and devices and to take in those zones measures necessary for their protection.

3.	The safety zones referred to in paragraph 2 of this article may extend to a distance of 500 metres around the installation and other devices which have been erected, measured from each point of their outer edge. Ships of all nationalities must respect these safety zones.

4.	Such installations and devices, though under the jurisdiction of the coastal State, do not possess the status of islands. They have no territorial sea of their own and their presence does not affect the delimitation of the territorial sea of the coastal State.

5.	Due notice must be given of the construction of any such installations and permanent means for giving warning of their presence must be maintained. Any installations which are abandoned or disused must be entirely removed.

6.	Neither the installations or devices, nor the safety zones around them, may be established where interference may be caused to the use of recognised sea lanes essential to international navigation.

7.	The coastal State is obliged to undertake, in the safety zones, all appropriate measures for the protection of the living resources of the sea from harmful agents.

8.	The consent of the coastal State shall be obtained in respect of any research concerning the continental shelf and undertaken there. Nevertheless the coastal State shall not normally withhold its consent if the request is submitted by a qualified institution with a view to purely scientific research into the physical or biological characteristics of the continental shelf, subject to the proviso that the coastal State shall have the right, if it so desires, to participate or to be represented in the research, and that in any event the results shall be published.

ARTICLE 6

1.	Where the same continental shelf is adjacent to the territories of two or more States whose coasts are opposite each other, the boundary of the continental shelf appertaining to such States shall be determined by agreement between them. In the absence of agreement, and unless another boundary line is justified by special circumstance, the boundary is the median line, every point of which is equidistant from the nearest points of the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea of each State is measured.

2.	Where the same continental shelf is adjacent to the territories of two adjacent States, the boundary of the continental shelf shall be determined by agreement between them. In the absence of agreement and unless another boundary line is justified by special circumstances, the boundary shall be determined by application of the principle of equidistance from the nearest points of the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea of each State is measured.

3.	In delimiting the boundaries of the continental shelf, any lines which are drawn in accordance with the principles set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this article should be defined with reference to charts and geo-graphical features as they exist at a particular date and reference should be made to fixed permanent identifiable points on the land.

ARTICLE 7

The provisions of these articles shall not prejudice the right of the coastal State to exploit the subsoil by means of tunnelling irrespective of the depth of water above the subsoil.

ARTICLE 8

This Convention shall, until 31 October, 1958, be open for signature by all States Members of the United Nations or of any of the specialised agencies and by any other State invited by the General Assembly of the United Nations to become a party to the Convention.

ARTICLE 9

(2) For each State ratifying or acceding to the Convention after the deposit of the twenty-second in-strument of ratification or accession, the Convention shall enter into force on the thirtieth day after deposit by such State of its instrument of ratification or accession.

ARTICLE 12

1.	At the time of signature, ratification or accession, any State may make reservations to articles of the Convention other than to articles 1 to 3 inclusive.

2.	Any Contracting State making a reservation in accordance with the preceding paragraph may at any time withdraw the reservation by a communication to that effect addressed to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.

ARTICLE 13

1. (1) After the expiration of a period of five years from the date on which this Convention shall enter into force, a request for the revision of this Convention may be made at any time by any Contracting Party by means of a notification in writing addressed to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.

(2) The General Assembly of the United Nations shall decide upon the steps, if any, to be taken in re-spect of such request.
