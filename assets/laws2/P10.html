PART VI

Liquefied petroleum gases

88.	Additional precautions

In this Part of these Regulations, the precautions to be observed in the handling and storage of lique-fied petroleum gases are additional to those in any other regulations relating to class 'A' petroleum and such other regulations shall be read accordingly.

89.	Licences for importation of liquefied petroleum gases

(1) Subject to the prior approval in writing of the Director-General, the appropriate authority may issue licences for the importation of liquefied petroleum gases and for their storage at bulk installations and depots. 

(2)	No liquefied petroleum gases may be imported, and no bulk installations or depots for such gases may be operated, without such a licence.

(3)	All such licences shall expire on the 31 December of the year in which they are issued.

90.	Storage of liquefied petroleum gases

(1)	Tanks for the storage of liquefied petroleum gases shall be designed for a working pressure cor-responding to the vapour pressure at the highest temperature that the contents of the tanks are likely to reach.

(2)	The storage tanks shall be fitted with one or more spring-loaded pressure relief valves which communicate directly with the vapour spaces of the tanks and the total discharge capacity of the pressure relief valves on each storage tank shall be such that it limits the pressure inside the tank to one- hundred and twenty per cent of the design pressure under any conditions.

(3)	A shut-off valve shall not be installed between a pressure relief valve and storage tank, except in cases where two or more relief valves are fitted to one tank and the shut-off valves are interlocked so that when one is shut the other is fully open and in any such cases the discharge capacity of the relief valve or valves open to the tank shall meet the requirements of paragraph (2) of this Regulation, and if it is found impracticable to interlock shut-off valves as in the case where safety-relief valves may be locked in the open position by means of padlocks, the keys of the padlocks shall be retained by a responsible member of the staff who shall ensure that only one shut-off valve is closed at one time.

(4)	All safety valves shall be fitted with vent pipes discharging vertically upwards at a minimum height of six feet above the tank top, and the vent pipes shall be fitted with loose-fitting rain caps and be drained at the bottom, the drain holes being located so as not to permit impingement of vapour or liquid on the surface of the storage tank.

(5)	Each storage tank shall be fitted with a pressure gauge and devices for measuring the liquid content and its temperature, and the maximum quantity of liquefied petroleum gas filled into any one tank shall be such that at the maximum operating temperature it will not occupy more than ninety-eight per cent of the capacity of the storage tank.

(6)	Drain-cocks or other shut-off valves which communicate direct with the outer atmosphere shall be fitted with caps or blank flanges in which a hole having a maximum diametre of one eighth of an inch shall be drilled, thereby restricting the flow from the valve and minimising the danger caused by careless operation.

(7)	Storage tanks shall be painted in light colours.

(8)	No storage tank shall be filled with liquefied petroleum gas having a vapour pressure greater than that of the petroleum product for which the tank is designed.

91.	Pipes and fitting

(1)	Pipeline layouts for use with storage tanks shall be suitably constructed according to recognised practice, with pipelines, valves and pipe fittings conforming to sound engineering practices and cast-iron valves and fittings shall on no account be used.

(2)	Where it is possible for any liquefied petroleum gas in its liquid phase to be trapped between two valves, a pressure relief valve shall be fitted notwithstanding that the space between the valves may be equipment such as a pump casing of a metre.

(3)	Excess flow valves shall be fitted as necessary to prevent the loss of liquefied petroleum gases from storage tanks and transport tanks and especially to protect points where flexible hoses are used.

(4)	Remote controlled hydraulically operated shut-valves shall be fitted to each storage tank.

92.	Container filling sheds

(1)	Containers shall be filled with liquefied petroleum gases only in buildings reserved exclusively for these products, and the floors of such buildings, which shall have a non-sparking surface, shall be at ground level or raised platform height.

If raised to platform height, the space under the platform may be left open on all sides to allow free ventilation or may be filled in. The space, if left open, shall not be used for any purpose other than ven-tilation and shall be kept free from rubbish. Pits in the floor shall be filled in solid to obviate the danger of gas accumulation and drains shall be provided with a gas-liquid separator situated outside the building.

(2)	Filled containers shall not be stored in the container-filling bay. If it is essential that the same structure be used for storage and filling, fire-proof wells shall be installed to separate the two operations.

(3)	Container filling operations shall be carried out at least 75 feet from any open fire and not less than fifty feet from any storage tanks and installation boundary, or in respect of any other petroleum product at the like distance from any filling shed or storage shed.

93.	Containers

(1)	The quantity of liquefied petroleum gas to be filled in any container shall not occupy more than ninety-five per cent of the total capacity at a temperature of 65°C or 150°F.

(2)	All containers shall be completely emptied before refilling.

(3)	After filling a container, all valves shall be tested to ensure that they are free from leaks.

(4)	No containers shall be vented to the atmosphere of the filling shed, and if it is necessary to vent the contents of a full or partially full container, it shall be removed to a safe place for this purpose:

Provided that a suitable vent line may be connected to carry the vented gases away from the filling shed for dispersal in a safe place.

(5)	Before filling the containers they shall be visually inspected for damage caused by denting or corrosion and for faulty valves, and they shall also be checked to make sure that they are of a type suit-able for the particular product it is proposed to fill into them.

94.	Charging containers

(1)	Every reasonable precaution shall be taken to ensure that valves and fittings on containers are in sound condition and that the containers are free from water, air or foreign matter, and inspection of empty containers shall include a check on weight and an examination of the name-plate to confirm the rating to be correct to specification for the proposed filling ratio.

(2)	When valves are found to be in the open position or in a damaged condition, special ventilation measures shall be taken to remove any gas, air or moisture present in the container.

(3)	Full containers shall be inspected by checking the weight and testing the container valves and on completion of the inspection the valves shall be sealed.

(4)	A suitable arrangement shall be provided to enable containers to be safely vented should it be necessary to reduce the contents or to effect repairs.

(5)	Relief valves shall be fitted in the filling line at any point where liquid may be trapped between closed valves. Discharge from relief valves shall not vent to atmosphere inside buildings. 

95.	Handling maintenance and test

(1)	Containers shall be handled with great care at all times and if the valve protective cover is de-tachable, it shall be replaced when the container is not in use.

(2)	Lubricants and jointing compounds shall be resistant to liquefied petroleum gas, water and heat.

(3)	When containers are not in use, outlet valves shall be kept tightly closed even if the containers are considered to be empty.

(4)	At intervals not exceeding five years, containers shall be hydraulically tested to one and a half times the working pressure and the date of the last test, the number of the container and the test pressure shall be painted on the container and recorded in a log book kept for that purpose by the licensee.

96.	Pipes and hoses

(1)	Valves, unions and hoses used for container filling shall be resistant to the solvent action of liq-uefied petroleum gases, and they shall be designed for a bursting pressure of five times the maximum pressure they will have to carry in service.

(2)	The hoses shall be provided with a union for attachment to the supply pipe and a quick-closing valve at the end to which the container is coupled, and the hoses, complete with unions and valves, shall be examined visually daily and tested hydraulically at monthly intervals, to twice their working pressure.

97.	Static electricity

All filling points, lines and connections, shall be electrically bonded and earthed and the resistance of the earth shall not exceed ten ohms.

98.	Fire precautions

(1)	Dry-powder fire extinguishers shall be kept readily available for use in connection with any liq-uefied petroleum gas installation in case of fire.

(2)	Installations shall be provided with a water supply for fire-fighting and gas storage tanks shall be fitted with water spray system utilising 'fog nozzles' or similar devices.

(3)	All oil prospecting licences issued before the commencement of these Regulations and falling within the meaning of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, shall be deemed modified by the provisions of these Regulations.

2.	Participation of the Federal Government in deep water allocations, etc.

(1)	Where an allocation of a deep water block referred to in paragraph 1 of these Regulations includes a reservation by the Federal Government of the right to a participating interest in an oil mining lease derived from an oil prospecting licence, the conditions specified in these Regulations shall apply.

(2)	The Federal Government shall exercise its rights to participate in such oil mining lease by ac-quiring five-sixths of the allottee’s interest in the relevant oil prospecting licence and oil mining lease (rounded up to the nearest whole percentage point of total interest in the deep water block) under such terms and conditions as may be determined, from time to time, by the Federal Government:

Provided that the terms and conditions of the agreement(s) that governs the acquired Federal Government participating interest in the oil prospecting licence and oil mining lease shall not be less favourable to the Federal Government than those in effect at the commencement of these Regulations, that is, the prevailing fiscal terms as well as those terms and conditions applicable to the Corporation in the Federal Government’s model form production sharing contracts in effect at the commencement of these Regulations or those applicable to the Corporation in the Federal Government’s model form production sharing contracts operational at the time of the allocation of the deep water block, whichever is the later.

(3)	Where the terms and conditions are less favourable to the Federal Government, such terms shall be modified to such extent as to bring them into conformity with the existing terms and conditions ap-plicable to the Corporation in such model form production sharing contract in effect at the commencement of these Regulations or those applicable to the Corporation in the Federal Government’s model form production sharing contracts operational at the time of the allocation of the deep water block, whichever is the later, only in so far as such terms and conditions are applicable to the Federal Government owned interest in the deep water block.

(4)	Where the company does not have a production sharing arrangement in place on the deep water block and each party funds its interest share directly, the Federal Government shall acquire five-sixths of the Nigerian ownership interest in the oil mining lease (rounded up to the nearest whole percentage point of total interest in the deep water block), as a funding participant to the extent of its interest in the deep water block.

3.	Interpretation

In these Regulations—

'Corporation' means the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation;

'deep water blocks' means those concessions for the exploration and/or exploitation of petroleum in which all or part are in waters deeper than 200 metres;

THE NATIONAL DOMESTIC GAS SUPPLY AND PRICING POLICY

[G.N. 31 of 2008.]

(A)	INTRODUCTION—Policy Aspirations

Given the abundance of Nigeria’s gas resources, Government has identified the accelerated devel-opment of the domestic gas sector as a focal strategy for achieving the national aspiration of aggressive GDP growth (ten per cent per annum). Domestic gas is defined as gas utilized locally within the shores of Nigeria, either for home, industrial and/or electric power use. Specifically for industrial use, gas used in value adding industries such as methanol, fertilizer, etc. is considered domestic gas, regardless of whether the end product (i.e. fertilizer, methanol) is consumed locally or exported.

Gas export (LNG and pipeline) provide high returns to government, through tax receipts and divi-dends for equity stake. However, it is recognized that beyond economic rent, there are broader strategic benefits to* the economy that may be attained from the domestic utilisation and value addition to natural gas. In essence, in addition to exporting of natural gas, Nigeria must develop strategies to ensure in-creased domestic utilisation.

Rising gas prices in key international markets however, continues to create a preferential pull for exports. Consequently, there is a disproportionate focus by gas suppliers in the country for LNG projects. This is creating an anomaly in Nigeria, where there is now a significant shortfall in the availability of gas for domestic utilisation. The continued shortfall directly threatens, the economic aspirations of the nation, which if unchecked, may result in Nigeria supporting the development of the economies of the industrialized nations, at the expense of its own economy.

The energy requirement to sustain an aggressive GDP growth is enormous. Currently, total demand (export and domestic) for natural gas far outstrips supply. The demand is driven by growth in the Power sector and other gas based industries, such as Fertilizer, Methanol, LNG, etc. Gas demand is forecast to grow from the current level of 4bcf/d to about 20bcf/d by 2010. In the short term, the growth in the do-mestic sector is particularly most aggressive, growing from less than 1bcf/d in 2006 to about 7bcf/d by 2010. This demand growth is underpinned largely by the power sector and by an increasing requirement by large industries such as fertilizer and methanol that require gas in high quantities. These industries which are unable to compete in high gas cost locations, have expressed strong interest in relocating to Nigeria.

Nigeria needs to demonstrate availability and affordability of gas or else, risk losing these industries to competing nations like Egypt, Trinidad, etc. The scale of demand growth relative to supply growth, creates an immediate availability challenge. In addition, is the challenge of price affordability and hence gas pricing. The domestic demand sectors such as electric power, fertilizer, methanol, etc. have varying capacity to bear gas prices (Fig. 1). For example, the Nigerian Power sector, has a lower gas price threshold than a Methanol industry. Government is however keen to stimulate the growth of all these sectors. Timely availability, affordability and commerciality of supply of natural gas, is a critical pie-condition for realizing the government’s aspiration for the domestic economy.

In recognition of the urgent need for domestic gas availability and a pricing framework to drive and sustain a major gas based industrialisation in Nigeria, this policy document seeks to—

1.	provide solutions to the issue of gas pricing;

2.	address domestic gas supply availability, in a manner that delicately balances the need for domestic economic growth and revenue generation from exports; and

3.	provide an implementation approach for the gas pricing, that enables the full participation of all gas suppliers in the country, in a manner that ensures sustained gas supply to the domestic market.

(B)	The need for a pricing strategy that recognises the diversity in the ability of the various industrial sub-sectors to bear gas price, cannot be overstated. Such strategy will not, only enable and sustain di-versity of the demand sectors, thereby enabling Nigeria to benefit from the industrialisation potential that is inherent in gas, it will also enable the selective maximization of net revenues for Nigerian gas, from sectors that are most able to deliver that direct economic benefit.

From a gas pricing strategy perspective, Government has grouped the entire domestic demand into three broad groupings. This grouping is in recognition of the fact that, the different demand sectors have different strategic benefits to the country and different pricing considerations. Fig. 2.1 below presents the 3 categories. Any demand sector will fall into one of these categories and where there is a lack of clarity, the Minister for Energy will determine the classification of such sector. 

The groupings are—

(i)	Strategic Domestic Sector.—This refers to a very limited set of sectors that have a sig-nificant direct multiplier effect on the economy, namely the Power Sector (residential and light commercial users) or other sectors that, the Honorable Minister for Energy may, from time to time, consider applicable. The strategic intent in gas pricing is to facilitate and ensure low cost gas access to these sectors in order to spur rapid economic growth.

(ii)	Strategic industrial Sector.—This refers to industries that utilise gas as feedstock in the production of value added products, that are primarily destined for export or in some cases, consumed locally. Strategically, these sectors ensure that value is added to Nigerian gas before it is exported. The process of value addition ensures industrialisation, job creation, etc. Typical projects in this group are Methanol, GTL and fertilizer. For this sector, the strategic intent in pricing is to, ensure that feedgas price is affordable and predictable, in order to ensure competitiveness of the products in international markets, in the face of competition from other gas producing countries such as Qatar, Trinidad, etc. that provide gas at very low prices to buyers.

(iii)	Commercial Sectors.—This refers to sectors that use gas as fuel, as opposed to feedstock. Unlike the two previous classifications, projects in this category are a potential major direct revenue earner for Nigerian gas, in view of their capacity to bear high gas prices as the competing alternative fuel is LPFO. Typical sector in this category include, cement and domestic manufacturing industries, industries Power, etc.

(C)	GAS PRICING REFORM LIQUIDS BASED PRICING APPROACH

A widely known characteristic of Nigerian gas, is its relative richness in liquids i.e. NGLs. NGLs continue to attract a high price in international markets (similar trend in crude oil pricing). As a result of the potential high revenue that comes from NGLs produced in conjunction with residue dry gas, it is possible for a gas supply project to accommodate a relatively lower price for the residue dry gas and still be a profitable supply project. Residue dry gas is used mostly in the domestic market.

This gas pricing policy aims to exploit this intrinsic value of NGLs, in deriving a relatively low gas price for the strategic domestic sector Power. It is recognized that, not all gas resources in the country are rich in NGLs, consequently, it is intended that this philosophy be applied selectively, especially in the short term, as the Power sector is Currently unable to pay higher price for gas (in view of the low end user power tariff that currently obtains in Nigeria). It is however the expectation that, in the medium term, power tariff will be more commercial and a higher gas price will be achievable.

Based on an assumption of $40/bbl long run NGL price, it has been established that across the Niger Delta, there is a limited volume of gas reserves for which the marginal cost of development and supply can be met profitably with a dry gas price of $0.1/mcf. This assumes that the supplier receives $0.1/mcf for the residue dry gas, in addition to other NGL revenues at $40/bbl. It is the intent of this policy that this category of gas reserves be deployed for use in the strategic domestic sectors. $0. 10/mmbtu is therefore established as the floor price for the strategic domestic sector. This low price is in line with the strategic intent of ensuring a low cost gas supply to those critical sectors of the economy.

In addition, based on existing transmission infrastructure costs in Nigeria and international bench-marks, a transmission tariff (on postage stamp basis) of $0.30/mmbtu is proposed. The Honourable Minister for Energy may revisit this tariff, from time to time, as appropriate.

(D)	THE GAS PRICING FRAMEWORK

The gas pricing framework proposed in this policy is a transitional pricing arrangement. The Hon-ourable Minister of Energy (Gas) will, monitor the environment and determine when the domestic market is fully developed and an alternative pricing approach is required.

It is important to establish that the pricing framework does not fix prices. It barely sets out a trans-parent structure for determining the floor price for dry gas for the 3 categories of demand sectors pre-sented in section B. The floor price is the lowest price that gas can be supplied to a particular category of demand sector. The actual price paid is based on an indexation formula, jointly determined during negotiation between the buyer and seller. In essence, the market actually determines the price, by estab-lishing the indexation mechanism.

Figure 3.1 below, presents a schematic of the pricing framework, 3 distinct price regimes are evident in the framework, corresponding to 3 different approaches for determining the floor price. The 3 approaches include—

(a)	Cost of supply basis (regulated pricing regime);

(b)	Product netback price basis and (pseudo-regulated pricing regime); and

(c)	Alternative fuels basis (market led regime).

(i)	The Regulated Pricing Regime (cost of supply basis).—This pricing approach applies specifically to the strategic domestic sectors of Power. As discussed in section C, the floor price for this category is determined primarily by establishing the lowest cost of supply that allows a 15 per cent rate of return to the supplier. This has been established as $0.1/mmbtu, for a limited volume of gas reserves. These reserves will therefore be assumed dedicated to the strategic domestic sector.

(ii)	The Pseudo-Regulated Pricing Regime {Product Netback basic).—The second floor price determination approach, applies strictly to strategic industrial sectors,

i.	e. sectors that use the gas as feedstock. For this group, the floor price is not based on the cost of supply of the gas, but on the netback of the product price. The product price used in determining the floor price is the assumed long run price of the product. With this approach, the pricing of gas will better reflect the ability of the sector to pay, given the price of its product. However, since the intention of this policy is not to support sectors that are unviable, i.e. sectors whose netback price translates to a gas-floor price lower than the cost of supply of gas, the consideration of affordability will not be at the expense of sustainability of gas supply.

(iii)	The Market Led Regime {Alternative Fuels Basis).—The third floor price determi-nation approach, applies to all other sectors that use gas as fuel or wholesale buyers, buying gas for subsequent resale, for this category, the price of gas is indexed to the price of alternative fuel such as LPFO. The indexation will be established during negotiation.

The foregoing structure provides the basis for the pricing framework illustrated below. Three segments can be identified in the framework, consistent with the 3 demand sector groupings, starting with the lowest priced sector, the strategic do-mestic sector to the highest priced sector; the commercial sectors. It is assumed that pricing for each demand sector will transition to the next higher pricing band, once a saturation level has been attained, For example, for the strategic domestic sector, once the domestic requirement has been met (domestic saturation point) and Power is now being exported, the framework proposes that export Power benefits from a relatively higher price, determined by the nethacking philosophy applied to strategic industrial sectors such as methanol. Similarly, once the capacity of a strategic industrial sector exceeds an export saturation limit (i.e., once Nigeria’s export capacity for that sector, fertilizer is assumed to have reached an acceptable limit), any incremental capacity, will attract a much higher price, consistent with that of commercial sector buyers. Through this transitional mechanism, pricing can be aligned with required capacities within the economy.

(iv)	Indexation.—It is important to reiterate that the entire gas pricing framework sim

ply specifies the floor price. Actual prices will include, an escalation for inflation and an indexation to real time product price (Which may be higher than the long run price used in the determination of the floor price) and/or any other indices, considered appropriate by both buyer and seller of the gas. The indexation will be determined through a process of negotiation.

(E)	IMPLEMENTATION

(i)	The Downstream Gas Act.—To underpin the proposed pricing framework, Gov-ernment will establish a Regulatory Agency, the Gas Regulatory Commission, (otherwise referred to as GRC) through the proposed Downstream Gas Act. Amongst other functions, the Commission will have the power, where necessary, to regulate the price of gas supplied and utilized in the downstream gas sector and the power to promote reliable and efficient use of gas throughout Nigeria. It will also have the power to monitor and impose pricing restrictions on licensees. Pending the establishment of this GRC however, an interim agency, will be set up by the Minister, as a department within the Ministry of Energy (Gas).

Consistent with the pricing principles established by the Act, the Commission will have the power to regulate the prices charged by licensees where competition has not developed to such an extent as to protect the interest of consumers. The rele-vant pricing principles in this regard are cost reflectivity, price disaggregation and the earning of a reasonable return on investment by licensees.

A Transitional Pricing Plan, setting out temporary or transitional pricing arrange-ments, allowing for a gradual transition towards pricing arrangements that are consistent with the pricing principles above, shall be introduced by the Downstream Gas Regulatory Agency. The gas pricing framework presented in this policy document, is designed to achieve this objective.

(ii)	Domestic Gas Reserves and Production Obligation.—In implementing this pricing policy, it is essential that there is sufficient gas available for the various demand sectors. To facilitate this, a domestic gas supply and reserves obligation will be imposed on all operators in the country. In essence, all gas (AG and NAG) asset holders, will be required to dedicate a specific proportion of their gas reserves and production for supply to the domestic market. This is the 'Domestic Reserves Obligation”.

The reserve obligation will be broken down annually to a production obligation for the same period. The sum total of all obligations will equal the planned domestic requirement for the stated period. Periodical reviews to the domestic obligation will take place to reflect the changing demographics of the demand and supply landscape, i.e. new demand will be allocated accordingly, as new suppliers come on stream.

The Minister for Energy will periodically, stipulate the reserves and production obligation of the various operators. The allocation of the obligation across opera-tors, will be based on the principles of equity to be determined by the Minister.

(iii)	The Aggregate Gets Price and the Strategic Gas Aggregator.—The gas pricing framework, stipulates a pricing regime for various demand sectors, ranging from a floor price of about $0.1/mcf for the strategic domestic sectors, to over $2/mcf for the commercial sectors. The Aggregate Domestic Gas Price is the forecast average domestic price, based on the projected total domestic demand portfolio, using the relevant prices proposed by this framework.

All suppliers of gas in the country will be paid the aggregate domestic gas price. A target aggregate price will be set by the Gas Regulator, based on the known port-folio of domestic demand. The portfolio will be balanced continually, to ensure that the aggregate price does not fall below the threshold. In essence, the suppliers have a fixed price, whilst the buyers will pay the sector price proposed in the framework. The aggregate pricing will ensure that regardless of their geographical location, all suppliers are able to benefit from the high priced customers, as well as from the low priced buyers. The aggregate price will ensure that the suppliers receive an acceptable return for their domestic obligation.

A Strategic Aggregator (under the auspice of the Department of Gas or the GRC) will manage the implementation of the domestic reserves and production obligation and the aggregate price. It will ensure a balanced growth of the domestic portfolio, such that, the large minimum aggregate price is achieved, whilst not compromising the nation’s primary objective for economic growth, by ensuring the availability of adequate volumes of gas to the strategic domestic sectors.

Conceptually, the Strategic Aggregator, acts as a one stop intermediary point between the suppliers and the diverse demand sectors and will ensure that gas is supplied at the aggregated price. Through a Gas Management Model, the Strategic Aggregator, plays the role of portfolio manager, on behalf of all suppliers, the primary objective being to preserve a minimum aggregate price portfolio. When the aggregate price is higher than the minimum threshold, an agreed portion will be paid out to the suppliers, whilst the balance will be retained as cushion in the event that the portfolio mix for unavoidable reasons falls below the target minimum threshold.

Conclusion

The National Domestic Gas Supply and Pricing Policy therefore, aims to fully align the gas sector with the economic growth aspiration of the nation. This policy will be applied, in conjunction with the Gas Pricing regulations and modifications thereto.
