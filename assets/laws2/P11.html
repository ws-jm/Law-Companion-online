There is hereby established a Fund to be known as the Petroleum Equalisation Fund (in this Act re-ferred to as the 'Fund”) into which shall be paid—

(a)     any net surplus revenue recovered from oil marketing companies pursuant to this Act; and

(b)	such sums as may be provided for that purpose by the Federal Government.

2.	Utilisation of the Fund

The Fund shall be utilised for the reimbursement of oil marketing companies for any loss sustained by them solely and exclusively as a result of the sale by them of petroleum products at uniform prices throughout Nigeria being prices fixed by the Minister pursuant to section 6 (1) of the Petroleum Act.

[Cap. P10.]

(a)	determining, at such intervals as the Board may direct, the net surplus revenue recoverable from any oil marketing company and accruing to that company from the sale by it of petroleum products at such uniform prices as may be fixed by the Minister pursuant to section 6 (1) of the Petroleum Act;

(b)	determining the amount of reimbursement due to any oil marketing company which has suf-fered a loss as a result of the operation of the enactment as aforesaid;

5.	Calculation of surplus revenue recoverable

The net surplus revenue recoverable from an oil marketing company under this Act shall be calculated by reference to the volume of the affected products sold on zonal basis and to the amount by which the uniform prices at which the products were sold exceeded, or were less than, the prices of those products prevailing immediately before the fixing of the uniform prices of the products.

6.	Prescribed dates for payment and penalty for non-payment

(1)	The Board shall, from time to time, by notice served by registered post on the oil marketing company concerned, specify the date on which any net surplus revenue due from that oil marketing company shall be paid to the Board.

(2)	If any sum is not paid within twenty-one days of the specified date, a sum equal to ten per cent of the amount unpaid shall be added for each month or part of a month after the date on which payment should have been made.

(3)	The Board may, if it thinks fit, remit in whole or in part any penalty imposed under this section.

7.	Accounts and audit

(1)	The Board shall keep proper accounts and proper records in relation thereto and shall prepare in respect of each financial year a statement of accounts in such form as the Minister may direct.

(2)	The Board shall not later than six months from the end of the financial year to which the accounts relate cause the accounts to be audited by auditors appointed by the Board, with the approval of the Minister.

(3)	The auditors shall on the completion of the audit of the accounts of each financial year prepare and submit to the Board a report setting out their observations and recommendations on all aspects of the accounts of the Board; and the Board shall forward a copy of the report to the Minister.

8.	Proceedings to recover unpaid net surplus revenue

(1)	Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, any net surplus revenue payable by an oil mar-keting company pursuant to this Act shall be recoverable by action as a debt owing to the Board at any time within six years from the date when payment of the sum became due.

(2)	Any action for the recovery of any sum under this section may be instituted on behalf of the Board by the secretary or by any employee of the Board and where the action is instituted in a magis-trate’s court any person authorised by this subsection may appear and conduct the case.

(3)	For the purposes of this section, the expression 'net surplus revenue' includes any penalty payable or imposed for non-payment or for late payment, as the case may be.

10.	Returns

The secretary may, with the approval of the Board, require any oil marketing company to furnish such returns and keep such records and produce them for examination by, or on behalf of, the secretary as appear to the secretary to be necessary for the carrying out of his functions under this Act.

(3)	Where an offence under this Act committed by a body corporate is proved to have been com-mitted with the consent or connivance of, or to be attributable to any neglect on the part of, any director, manager, secretary or other similar officer of the body corporate (or any person purporting to act in any such capacity) he, as well as the body corporate, shall be deemed to be guilty of the offence and may be proceeded against and punished accordingly.
