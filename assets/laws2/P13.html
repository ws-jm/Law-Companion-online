(d)	the amount of any loss incurred during any accounting period by the foreign company in the said trade or business previously carried on by it in Nigeria, being a loss which has not been allowed against any assessable profits of any accounting period of that foreign company, shall be deemed to be a loss incurred by the Reconstituted Company in its trade or business during its first accounting period; and the amount of that loss shall in accordance with the provisions of section 16 of this Act, be deducted from the adjusted profits of the Reconstituted Company:

(a)	to the established posted prices of Nigerian crude oils of comparable quality and gravity, if any; or

(b)	if there are no such established posted prices for such Nigerian crude oils to the posted prices at main international trading export centers for crude oil of comparable quality and gravity,

(5)	Any such rules may be amended or replaced from time to time with or without retrospective effect.

(6)	The effect of any such rules shall not impose a greater burden of tax upon any company so en-gaged in any partnership, joint adventure, scheme or arrangement than would have been imposed upon that company under this Act if all things enjoyed, done or suffered by such partnership, joint adventure, scheme or arrangement had been enjoyed, done or suffered by that company in the proportion in which it enjoys, does or suffers those things under or by virtue of that partnership, joint adventure, scheme or arrangement.

25.	Companies not resident in Nigeria

(1)	A company not resident in Nigeria which is or has been engaged in petroleum operations (here-inafter in this section referred to as a 'non-resident company”) shall be assessable and chargeable to tax, either directly or in the name of its manager, or in the name of any other person who is resident in Nigeria, employed in the management of the petroleum operations carried on by such non-resident company, as such non-resident company would be assessed and charged if it were resident in Nigeria.

Where a company which is or was engaged in petroleum operations transfers a substantial part of its assets to any person without having paid any tax, assessed or chargeable upon the company, for any accounting period ending prior to such transfer and in the opinion of the Board one reason for such transfer by the company was to avoid payment of such tax then that tax as charged upon the company may be sued for and recovered from that person in a manner similar to a suit for any other tax under section 48 of this Act subject to any necessary modification of that section.

29.	Indemnification of representative

(1)	The provisions of this section shall have effect where, under arrangements having effect under section 61 of this Act, foreign tax payable in respect of any income in the territory with the Government of which the arrangements are made is to be allowed as a credit against tax payable in respect of that income in Nigeria; and in this section the expression 'foreign tax' means any tax payable in that territory which, under the arrangements, is to be so allowed, and 'income' means that part of the profits of any accounting period which is liable to both tax and foreign tax, before the deduction of any tax, foreign tax, credit therefor or relief granted under subsection (6) of this section.

(2)	The amount of the credit admissible to any company under the terms of any such arrangements shall be set off against the tax chargeable upon that company in respect of the income, and where that tax has been paid the amount of the credit may be repaid to that company or carried forward against the tax chargeable upon that company of any subsequent accounting period.

(3)	The credit for an accounting period shall not exceed whichever is the less of the following amounts, that is to say—

(a)	the amount of the foreign tax payable on the income; or

(b)	the amount of the difference between the tax chargeable under this Act (before allowance of

credit under any arrangements having effect under section 61 of this Act) and the tax which would be so chargeable if the income were excluded in computing profits.

(4)	Without prejudice to the provisions of subsection (3) of this section, the total credit to be allowed to a company for any accounting period for foreign tax under all arrangements having effect under section 61 of this Act shall not exceed the total tax which would be ultimately borne by that company, for that accounting period, if no such credit had been allowed.

(5)	Where the income includes a dividend and under the arrangements foreign tax not chargeable directly or by deduction in respect of the dividend is to be taken into account in considering if any, and if so what, credit is to be given against tax in respect of the dividend, the amount of the income shall be increased by the amount of the foreign tax not so chargeable which falls to be taken into account in computing the amount of the credit.

(6)	Where the amount of the foreign tax attributable to the income exceeds the credit therefor com-puted under subsection (3) of this section, then the amount of that income, to be included in computing profits for any purpose of this Act other than that of subsection (3) of this section, shall be taken to be the amount of that income increased by the amount of the credit therefor after deduction of the foreign tax.

(7)	Wherein-

(a) the arrangements provide, in relation to dividends of some classes, but not in relation to dividends of other classes, that foreign tax not chargeable directly or by deduction in respect of dividends is to be taken into account in considering if any, and if so what, credit is to be given against tax in respect of the dividends; and

(b)	a dividend is paid which is not of a class in relation to which the arrangements so provide,

then, if the dividend is paid to a company which controls, directly or indirectly, not less than half of the voting power in the company paying the dividends, credit shall be allowed as if the dividend were a dividend of a class in relation to which the arrangements so provide.

(8)	Any claim for an allowance by way of credit shall be made not later than three years after the end of the accounting period, and in the event of any dispute as to the amount allowable the Board shall give to the claimant notice of refusal to admit the claim which shall be subject to appeal in like manner as an assessment.

(9)	Where the amount of any credit given under the arrangements is rendered excessive or insufficient by reason of any adjustment of the amount of any tax payable either in Nigeria or elsewhere, nothing in this Act limiting the time for the making of assessments or claims for repayment of tax shall apply to any assessment or claim to which the adjustment gives rise, being an assessment or claim made not later than three years from the time when all such assessments, adjustments and other determinations have been made, whether in Nigeria or elsewhere, as are material in determining whether any, and if so what, credit falls to be given.

(10)	Where a company is not resident in Nigeria throughout an accounting period no credit shall be admitted in respect of any income included in the profits of that company of that period.

63.	Power to amend the First Schedule

SECOND SCHEDULE

[Sections 10,20 and 30.]

Capital allowances

1.	Interpretation

(1) For the purposes of this Schedule, unless the context otherwise requires—

'lease' includes an agreement for a lease where the term to be covered by the lease has begun, any tenancy and any agreement for the letting or hiring out of an asset, but does not include a mortgage, and all cognate expressions including 'leasehold interest' shall be construed accordingly; and—

(a)	where, with the consent of the lessor, a lessee of any asset remains in possession thereof after the termination of the lease without a new lease being granted to him, that lease shall be deemed for the purposes of this Schedule to continue so long as he remains in possession as aforesaid; and

(b)	where, on the termination of a lease of any asset, a new lease of that asset is granted to the lessee, the provisions of this Schedule shall have effect as if the second lease were a continuation of the first lease;

[No. 15 of 1973.]

'qualifying expenditure' means, subject to the express provisions of this Schedule, expenditure in-curred in an accounting period which is—

(a)	capital expenditure (hereinafter called 'qualifying plant expenditure”) incurred on plant, ma-chinery or fixtures;

(b)	capital expenditure (hereinafter called 'qualifying pipeline and storage expenditure”) incurred on pipelines and storage tanks;

(c)	capital expenditure (hereinafter called 'qualifying building expenditure”), other than expenditure which is included in paragraph (a), (b) or (d) of this interpretation, incurred on the construction of buildings, structures or works of a permanent nature; or 

(d)	capital expenditure (hereinafter called 'qualifying drilling expenditure”) other than expendi-ture which is included in paragraph (a) or (b) of this interpretation, incurred in connection with, or with petroleum operations in view of—

(i)	the acquisition of, or of rights in or over, petroleum deposits;

(ii)	searching for or discovering and testing petroleum deposits, or winning access thereto; or

(iii)	the construction of any works or buildings which are likely to be of little or no value when the petroleum operations for which they were constructed cease to be carried on:

Provided that, for the purposes of this definition qualifying expenditure shall not include any sum which may be deducted under the provisions of section 10 of this Act.

(2) For the purposes of this interpretation of qualifying expenditure, where expenditure is incurred by a company before its first accounting period and such expenditure would have fallen to be treated as qualifying expenditure (ascertained without the qualification contained in the foregoing proviso) if it had been incurred by the company on the first day of its first accounting period, and—

(a)	that expenditure is incurred in respect of an asset owned by the company then such expenditure shall be deemed to be qualifying expenditure incurred by it on that day; or

(b)	that expenditure is incurred in respect of an asset which has been disposed of by the company before the beginning of its first accounting period then any loss suffered by the company on the disposal of such asset shall be deemed to be qualifying petroleum expenditure incurred by the company on that day and be deemed to have brought into existence an asset owned by the company in use for the purposes of petroleum operations carried on by the company, and any profit realised by the company on such disposal shall be treated as income of the company of its first accounting period for the purposes of section 9 (1) (a) of this Act.

2.	Provisions relating to qualifying petroleum expenditure

(1)	For the purposes of this Schedule where—

(a)	expenditure has been incurred before its first accounting period and such expenditure would have been treated as such qualifying petroleum expenditure (ascertained without the qualification contained in the proviso in the interpretation of qualifying expenditure) if it had been incurred in that first accounting period; and

(b)	such expenditure has not brought into existence an asset,

then such expenditure (ascertained in the case of sub-paragraph (1) (a) of this paragraph without such qualification) shall be deemed to have brought into existence an asset owned by the company incurring the expenditure and in use for the purposes of such petroleum operations.

(2)	For the purposes of this Schedule, an asset in respect of which qualifying drilling expenditure has been incurred by any company for the purposes of petroleum operations carried on by it during any accounting period of the company, and which has not been disposed of, shall be deemed not to cease to be used for the purposes of such operations so long as such company continues to carry on such operations.

(3)	So much of any qualifying petroleum expenditure incurred on the acquisition of rights in or over petroleum deposits and on the purchase of information relating to the existence and extent of such deposits as exceeds the total of the original cost of acquisition of such rights and of the cost of searching for, discovering and testing such deposits prior to the purchase of such information shall be left out of account for the purposes of this Schedule:

Provided that where the company which originally incurred such costs was a company which carried on a trade or business consisting, as to the whole or part thereof, in the acquisition of such rights or information with a view to the assignment or sale thereof, the price paid on such assignment or sale shall be substituted for the aforementioned costs.

3.	Owner and meaning of relevant interest

(1) For the purposes of this Schedule, where an asset consists of a building, structure or works, the owner thereof shall be taken to be the owner of the relevant interest in such building, structure or works.

(2)	Subject to the provisions of this paragraph, in this Schedule, the expression 'the relevant interest' means, in relation to any expenditure incurred on the construction of a building, structure or works, the interest in such building, structure or works to which the company which incurred such expenditure was entitled when it incurred the expenditure.

(3)	Where, when a company incurs qualifying building expenditure or qualifying drilling expenditure on the construction of a building, structure or works, the company is entitled to two or more interests therein, and one of those interests is an interest which is reversionary on all the others, that interest shall be the relevant interest for the purposes of this Schedule.

4.	Sale of buildings, etc.

Where capital expenditure has been incurred on the construction of a building, structure or works and thereafter the relevant interest therein is sold, the company which buys that interest shall be deemed, for all the purposes of this Schedule except the granting of petroleum investment allowance, to have incurred, on the date when the purchase price became payable, capital expenditure on the construction thereof equal to the price paid by it for such interest or to the original cost of construction, whichever is the less:

Provided that—

(a)	where such relevant interest is sold before the building, structure or works has been used, the foregoing provisions of this paragraph shall have effect with respect to such sale with the omission of the words 'except the granting of petroleum investment allowance' and the original cost of construction shall be taken to be the amount of the purchase price on such sale;

(b)	where any such relevant interest is sold more than once before the building, structure or works is used, the provisions of sub paragraph (a) shall have effect only in relation to the last of those sales.

5.	Petroleum investment allowance

(1)	For the purposes of this Act and subject to the provisions of this Schedule, where a company has incurred any qualifying capital expenditure wholly, exclusively and necessarily for the purposes of petroleum operations carried out by it, there shall be due to that company, for the accounting period in which that asset was first used or for the purposes of such operations, an allowance (in this Schedule called 'Petroleum Investment Allowance”) at the appropriate rate per cent, set forth in Table I to this Schedule, of such expenditure.

(2)	For the purpose of this Act, the Petroleum Investment Allowance shall be added to the annual al-lowance computed under paragraph 6 of this Schedule and shall be subject to the same rules under this Act.

6.	Annual allowance

(1)	Subject to the provisions of this Schedule, where in any accounting period, a company owning any assets has incurred in respect thereof qualifying expenditure wholly, necessarily and exclusively for the purposes of petroleum operations carried on by it, there shall be due to that company as from the accounting period in which such expenditure was incurred, an allowance (in this Act referred to as 'an annual allowance”) at the appropriate rate per cent specified in Table II of this Schedule.

(2)	Notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph, there shall be retained in the books, in respect of each asset one per cent of the initial cost asset which may only be written off in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) of this paragraph.

(3)	Any asset or part thereof in respect of which capital allowances have been granted may only be disposed of on the authority of a Certificate of Disposal issued by the Minister or any person authorised by him.

(4)	Any unrecovered capitalised expenditure prior to 1 April, 1977, shall be deemed to have been capitalised with effect from 1 April 1977 and shall, as provided for in sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph, be amortised in five equal instalments and shall be subject to the provisions of sub-paragraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph.

7.	Asset to be in use at end of accounting period

An initial or an annual allowance in respect of qualifying expenditure incurred in respect of any asset shall only be due to a company for any accounting period if at the end of such accounting period it was the owner of that asset and the asset was in use for the purposes of the petroleum operations carried on by it.

8.	Balancing allowances

Subject to the provisions of this Schedule, where in any accounting period of a company, the company owning any asset in respect of which it has incurred qualifying expenditure wholly and exclusively for the purposes of petroleum operations carried on by it, disposes of that asset an allowance (hereinafter called 'a balancing allowance”) shall be due to that company for that accounting period of the excess of the residue of that expenditure, at the date such asset is disposed of, over the value of that asset at that date:

Provided that a balancing allowance shall only be due in respect of such asset if immediately prior to its disposal it was in use by such company for the purposes of the petroleum operations for which such qualifying expenditure was incurred.

9.	Balancing charges

Subject to the provisions of this Schedule, where in any accounting period of a company, the company owning any asset in respect of which it has incurred qualifying expenditure wholly and exclusively for the purposes of petroleum operations carried on by it, disposes of that asset, the excess (hereinafter called 'a balancing charge”) of the value of that asset, at the date of its disposal, over the residue of that expenditure at that date shall, for the purposes of section 9 (1) (a) of this Act, be treated as income of the company of that accounting period:

Provided that a balancing charge in respect of such asset shall only be so treated if immediately prior to the disposal of that asset it was in use by such company for the purposes of the petroleum operations for which such qualifying expenditure was incurred and shall not exceed the total of any allowances due under the provisions of this Schedule, in respect of such asset.

10.	Residue

The residue of qualifying expenditure, in respect of any asset, at any date, shall be taken to be the total qualifying expenditure incurred on or before that date, by the owner thereof at that date, in respect of that asset, less the total of any annual allowances due to such owner, in respect of that asset, before that date.

11.	Meaning of 'disposed of'

Subject to any express provision to the contrary, for the purposes of this Schedule—

(a)	a building, structure or works of a permanent nature is disposed of if any of the following events occur—

(i)	the relevant interest is sold; or

(ii)	that interest, being an interest depending on the duration of a concession, comes to an end on the coming to an end of that concession; or

(iii)	that interest, being a leasehold interest, comes to an end otherwise than on the company entitled thereto acquiring the interest which is reversionary thereon; or

(iv)	the building, structure or works of a permanent nature are demolished or destroyed or, without being demolished or destroyed, cease altogether to be used for the purposes of petroleum operations carried on by the owner thereof;

(b)	plant, machinery or fixtures are disposed of if they are sold, discarded or cease altogether to be used for the purposes of petroleum operations carried on by the owner thereof;

(c)	assets in respect of which qualifying drilling expenditure is incurred are disposed of if they are sold or if they cease to be used for the purposes of the petroleum operations of the company incurring the expenditure either on such company ceasing to carry on all such operations or on such company receiving insurance or compensation monies therefor.

12.	Value of an asset

(1) The value of an asset at the date of its disposal shall be the net proceeds of the sale thereof or of the relevant interest therein, or, if it was disposed of without being sold, the amount which, in the opinion of the Board, such asset or the relevant interest therein, as the case may be, would have fetched if sold in the open market at that date, less the amount of any expenses which the owner might reasonably be expected to incur if the asset were so sold.

(2) For the purpose of this paragraph, if an asset is disposed of in such circumstances that insurance or compensation monies are received by the owner thereof, the asset or the relevant interest therein, as the case may be, shall be treated as having been sold and as though the net proceeds of the insurance or compensation monies were the net proceeds of the sale thereof.

13.	Apportionment

(1)	Any reference in this Schedule to the disposal, sale or purchase of any asset includes a reference to the disposal, sale or purchase of that asset, as the case may be, together with any other asset, whether or not qualifying expenditure has been incurred on such last-mentioned asset, and, where an asset is disposed of, sold, or purchased together with another asset, so much of the value of the assets as, on a just apportionment, is properly attributable to the first-mentioned asset shall, for the purposes of this Schedule, be deemed to be the value of, or the price paid for, that asset, as the case may be. For the purposes of this sub-paragraph, all the assets which are purchased or disposed of in pursuance of one bargain shall be deemed to be purchased or disposed of together, notwithstanding that separate prices are or purport to be agreed for each of those assets or that there are or purport to be separate purchases or disposals of those assets.

(2)	The provisions of sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph shall apply, with any necessary modifica-tions, to the sale or purchase of the relevant interest in any asset together with any other asset or relevant interest in any other asset.

14.	Part of an asset

Any reference in this Schedule to any asset shall be construed whenever necessary as including a reference to a part of any asset (including an undivided part of that asset in the case of joint interests therein) and when so construed any necessary apportionment shall be made as may, in the opinion of the Board, be just and reasonable.

15.	Extension of meaning of 'in use"

(1)	For the purposes of this Schedule, an asset shall be deemed to be in use during a period of temporary disuse.

(2)	For the purposes of paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 of this Schedule—

(a)	an asset in respect of which qualifying expenditure has been incurred by the owner thereof for the purposes of petroleum operations carried on by him shall be deemed to be in use for the purposes of such operations, between the dates hereinafter mentioned, where the Board is of the opinion that the first use to which the asset will be put by that owner incurring such expenditure will be for the purposes of such operations;

(b)	the said dates shall be taken to be the date on which such expenditure was incurred and the date on which the asset is in fact first put to use:

Provided that where any allowances have been given in consequence of this sub-paragraph (2) of this paragraph and the first use to which such asset is put is not for the purposes of such operations, all such additional assessments shall be made as may be necessary to counteract the benefit obtained from the giving of any such allowances.

16.	Exclusion of certain expenditure

(1)	Subject to the express provisions of this Schedule, where any company has incurred expenditure which is allowed to be deducted under any provision (other than a provision of this Schedule) of this Act, such expenditure shall not be or be treated as qualifying expenditure.

(2)	Where any company has incurred expenditure upon any ocean going oil tanker plying between Nigeria and any other territory that expenditure shall not be treated as qualifying expenditure.

17.	Asset used or expenditure incurred partly for the purpose of petroleum operations

(1) The following provisions of this paragraph shall apply where, either or both of the following conditions apply with respect to any asset—

(a) the owner of the asset has incurred in respect thereof qualifying expenditure partly for the purposes of petroleum operations carried on by him and partly for other purposes; 

(b) the asset in respect of which qualifying expenditure has been incurred by the owner thereof is used partly for the purposes of petroleum operations carried on by such owner and partly for other purposes.

(2)	Any allowances which would be due or any balancing charges which would be treated as income if both such expenditure were incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of such petroleum operations and such asset were used wholly and exclusively for the purposes of such operations shall be computed in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule.

(3)	So much of the allowances and charges computed in accordance with the provisions of sub- paragraph (2) of this paragraph shall be due or shall be so treated, as the case may be, as in the opinion of the Board is just and reasonable having regard to all the circumstances and to the provisions of this Schedule.

18.	Disposal without change of ownership

Where an asset in respect of which qualifying expenditure has been incurred by the owner thereof has been disposed of in such circumstances that such owner remains the owner thereof, then, for the purposes of determining whether and, if so, in what amount, any annual or balancing allowance or balancing charge shall be made to or on such owner in respect of his use of that asset after the date of such disposal—

(a)	qualifying expenditure incurred by such owner in respect of such asset prior to the date of such disposal shall be left out of account; but

(b)	such owner shall be deemed to have bought such asset immediately after such disposal for a price equal to the residue of such qualifying expenditure at the date of such disposal, increased by the amount of any balancing charge or decreased by the amount  of any balancing allow
