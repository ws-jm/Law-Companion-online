(16)	If any objection is taken for any alleged defect therein either in substance or in form or if ob-jection is taken for variance between the charge and the evidence adduced at the hearing the delegated officer shall make such order for the amendment of the charge as appears to him to be desirable in the interest of justice:

Provided that if any variance appears to the delegated officer to be such that the defaulter has been thereby deceived or misled, he may, and at the request of the defaulter, shall adjourn the proceed-ings to some future date.

(17)	The delegated officer at any time during the proceedings for sufficient reason may either at the request of the defaulter or of his own motion adjourn the proceedings from time to time.

Provided that the delegated officer may either at his own discretion or at the request of the defaulter record the evidence of the defaulter or of any particular witness in full. Such evidence shall then be signed by the defaulter or the witness, as the case may be, and countersigned by the delegated officer.

(28)	After recording a finding of guilty, the delegated officer shall invite the defaulter to tender any statement he may wish in extenuation of the offence, and any statement so tendered shall be recorded in writing—

(a)	if the evidence in defence to the charge is recorded in writing; or 

(b)	if the defaulter has admitted the truth of the charge and the punishment that may be awarded is a reprimand or a fine of H4 or a more severe punishment.

(29)	After considering the statement, if any, made by the defaulter in extenuation of the offence, the delegated officer shall, subject to the provisions of sub-paragraph (30), award one or more of the pun¬ishments he is empowered to award.

(30)	If the delegated officer is of the opinion that the facts disclosed in support of the charge or charges merit a more severe punishment than he is empowered to award, he shall forward the investiga-tion papers together with his findings and comments to a delegated officer, his superior in rank, for ad-judication.

(31)	Where a delegated officer receives for adjudication from a delegated officer his subordinate in rank, the papers of an investigation into an offence against discipline, he may—
