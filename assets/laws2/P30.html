[Date of commencement: 15th December, 1986] PART I

Licensing of Private Guard Companies

1.	Private Guard Companies to be licensed

(1)	As from the commencement of this Act, no organisation shall perform the service of watching, guarding, patrolling or carrying of money for the purpose of providing protection against crime unless the organisation concerned—

(a)	is registered as a company under or pursuant to the Companies and Allied Matters Act; and

[Cap. C20.]

(b)	has applied for and has been granted a licence by the Minister in accordance with the provi-sions of this Act.

(2)	Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, where on the coming into operation of this Act any company is carrying on private guard business in Nigeria, such company may apply within six months thereafter to be licensed but shall cease to carry on private guard business of any description in Nigeria after the expiration of twelve months from the coming into operation of this Act unless, prior to the expiration of the said period such company, being a registered company, is licensed to continue the particular class or classes of private guard business in respect of which application had been made by the company concerned.

2.	Application for licence

(1)	An application for a licence shall be made in writing through the licensing authority to the Min-ister in the manner and giving such particulars as specified in Form A in the Schedule to this Act.

[Schedule, Form A.]

(2)	The Minister may, before considering any such application, require from the applicant—

(a)	further evidence, as the Minister may specify, concerning the good character, competence and integrity of any director or other person responsible for or in charge of the operation of the company concerned;

(b)	where Alsatian or other guard dogs are to be employed in the services of the company, suffi-cient evidence that all existing regulations relating to animal health and certification have been complied with; and

(c)	such further information as the Minister may specify.

(3)	An application for a licence shall be accompanied by such fee as the Minister may prescribe.

(4)	An application for a licence shall be accompanied by a statement setting out the conditions of service (including salaries) of the employees or prospective employees of the company making the ap-plication.

3.	Granting of licence to operate

The Minister may grant a licence as specified in Form B in the Schedule to this Act to the applicant if he is satisfied that the grant is justified having regard to national security and the public interest.

[Schedule, Form B.]

4.	Nature and effect of licence to operate

(1)	A licence granted by the Minister under the provisions of section 3 shall be valid and operative for two years from the date of issue.

(2)	Any such licence shall specify the number of offices, branches or other places of business which the company is permitted to maintain.

(3)	A licence may be suspended or revoked by the Minister at any time if he is satisfied that the company holding the licence is unsuitable to continue to hold such licence.

(4)	A licence may be suspended or revoked by the Minister at any time where in his opinion the ownership or control of, or any controlling interest in the company to which the licence relates has passed to any other company or organisation which is generally unsuitable to be considered for the grant of such licence.

5.	Registered address

(1)	Every company licensed under this Act shall on the day it is registered notify the licensing au-thority in writing of the addresses of all its branches in Nigeria, so however that a postal box address or a private mail bag address shall not by itself satisfy the obligation imposed on the company under this subsection.

(2)	Notice of any change in the registered address of the company or of the address of any branch thereof shall be given by the company within fourteen days thereof to the licensing authority who shall cause same to be recorded.

(3)	If a company carries on business without complying with the requirements of this section, it and every officer thereof shall be liable to a fine of N500. 

6.	Licence to be displayed

7.	Employees to be approved

Subject to section 36 (3), no company licensed to operate under this Act shall employ any person unless an approval has been granted as specified in Form C in the Schedule to this Act for the person to be employed in such company.

[Schedule, Form C.]

8.	Application for employee’s approval

[Schedule, Form D.]

(2)	The Minister may before considering any application, require from the applicant—

(b)	such further information as the Minister may specify.

9.	Nature and effect of employee’s approval

(1)	An approval to which section 7 relates shall authorise the applicant to be employed by the com-pany specified in such approval.

(2)	An approval granted under section 7 shall specify the kind of work which the applicant is authorised to perform.

(3)	An approval granted under section 7 may be withdrawn by the Minister at any time if he is sat-isfied that the person concerned is unsuitable to continue to be so employed.

(4)	Upon the withdrawal of an approval granted under section 7, every identification card issued to that employee shall cease to be valid and shall forthwith be surrendered to the Minister.

10.	Issue of identity card

(1)	Upon the grant of an approval under section 7, the Minister shall authorise the company to issue or cause to be issued an identity card to the employee containing the photograph and personal descrip-tion and details of the employee in such form as the Minister may determine.

(2)	The employee shall carry the identity card at all times when on duty on behalf of the company by which he is employed.

12.	Replacement of lost licences

(1)	Where a licence issued under this Act is lost or defaced or is otherwise not in a fit state to be used as a licence, the licensee may apply to the licensing authority for a duplicate licence.

(2)	Every application by the licensee for a duplicate licence shall be accompanied by the prescribed fee and such particulars as the Minister may prescribe.

(3)	In this section, “licence’’ means a licence issued pursuant to section 3 of this Act and “licen¬see’’ shall be construed accordingly.

13.	Restriction on grant of licence or approval

(1)	The licensing authority shall not grant any licence or approval under the provisions of this Act if any director of the company or the person applying for approval—
