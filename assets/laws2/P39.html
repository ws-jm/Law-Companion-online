FOURTH SCHEDULE

[Section 79 (4).]



Rules of procedure for criminal prosecution at the court

Commencement and conduct of trial of offences



1.	The trial of offences under this Act shall be by way of summary trial.

2.	Commencement of trial

(1) When the court is ready to commence the trial the accused shall be brought before it and the court shall read or cause to be read to him the substance of the complaint against him and he shall be asked whether he is guilty of the offence or offences charged. 

(2) If the accused pleads guilty, the plea shall be recorded and he may in the discretion of the court be convicted of the offence.

3.	Plea of not guilty or no plea

If the accused pleads not guilty or makes no plea or refuses to plead or if the court enters a plea of not guilty on behalf of the accused, the court shall proceed to try the case.

4.	Presentation of case for prosecution

(1)	After a plea of not guilty has been taken or no plea has been made, the prosecutor may open the case against the accused, stating shortly by what evidence he intends to prove the guilt of the accused.

(2)	The prosecutor shall then examine the witnesses for the prosecution who may be cross-examined by the accused or his counsel and may thereafter be re-examined by the prosecutor.

5.	Procedure after presentation of evidence by the prosecutor

(1)	After the conclusion of the presentation of evidence by the prosecutor, the court shall ask the ac¬cused—

(a)	whether he wishes to give evidence on his own behalf; and

(b)	whether he intends to call witnesses other than witnesses to character.



(2)	If the accused says that he does not intend to call any witnesses other than witnesses to character, the prosecutor may sum up his case against the accused and the court shall call upon the accused to enter upon the defence.

(3)	Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (2) of this Rule, the court may, after hearing the evi¬dence for the prosecution, if it considers that the evidence against the accused or any of several accused is not sufficient to justify the continuation of the trial, record a finding of not guilty in respect of such accused without calling upon him or them to enter the defence and such accused shall thereupon be discharged and acquitted and the court shall then call upon the remaining accused, if any, to enter upon the defence.

(4)	If the accused or any one of several accused says that he intends to call any witness, other than a witness to character, the court shall call upon the accused to enter upon the defence.

(5)	Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (4) of this Rule, the court may, before calling upon the accused to enter upon the defence, call upon the prosecutor to sum up his case against any one or more of the accused against whom it considers that the evidence is not sufficient to justify the continuation of the trial and, after hearing the summing up, if any, may in its discretion record a finding of not guilty in respect of any such accused or call upon any of them to enter upon his or their defence.

6.	Defence

When the court calls upon the accused to enter upon the defence, the accused or his counsel may open his case stating the facts or law on which he intends to rely and making such comments as he thinks necessary on the evidence for the prosecution, and the accused may then give evidence on his own behalf, examine his wit¬nesses, if any, and, after their cross-examination, and re-examination, if any, the accused or his counsel may sum up his case.

7.	Right of prosecutor to reply

(1)	If the accused or any of the accused calls any witness, other than a witness to character, or any document, other than a document relating to character, is put in evidence for the defence, the prosecutor shall be entitled to reply.

(2)	If the accused has called only evidence as to character, the prosecutor may, at the close of the case for the defence, adduce evidence of previous convictions of the accused.

(3)	Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this Rule, the prosecution may, with the leave of the court, be heard in reply on a point of law or on any new matter or evidence, other than evidence as to character introduced by the accused.

8.	Consideration of findings

When the case for the defence and the reply of the prosecution, if any, are concluded and the court does not desire to put any further question to the accused, the court shall retire or adjourn to consider its findings.

9.	Announcement of findings

After the court has made its findings, the court shall announce such findings, and, where the accused is found guilty, it shall impose the appropriate penalty prescribed in this Act and issue an appropriate order accordingly.

10.	Recommendation as to mercy

The court may, in addition to its sentence, make appropriate recommendation as to mercy but in any such case shall give reasons for such recommendation.

11.	Notes of evidence to be taken

(1)	The Judge shall in every case take notes in writing of the oral evidence, or so much thereof as he considers material, in a book to be kept for that purpose and such book shall be signed by the Judge at the conclusion of each day’s proceeding.

(2)	The record so kept as aforesaid or copy thereof purporting to be signed and certified as a true copy by the Judge shall, without further proof, be admitted as evidence of such proceedings and of the statements made by the witnesses.

12.	Issue of summons for witness

If the court is satisfied that any person is likely to give material evidence for the prosecution or for the defence, the court may issue a summons to such person requiring him to attend, at a time and place to be mentioned therein, before the court to give evidence in respect of the case and to bring with him any speci¬fied documents or things and any other documents or things relating thereto which may be in his possession or power or under his control.

13.	Warrant of witness after summons

If the person to whom any such summons is directed does not attend before the court at the time and place mentioned therein and there does not appear to the court on inquiry to be any reasonable excuse for such non-attendance then after proof to the satisfaction of the court that the summons was duly served or that the person to whom the summons is directed wilfully avoided service, the court, on being satisfied that such person is likely to give material evidence, may issue a warrant to apprehend him and to bring him, at the time and place to be mentioned in the warrant before the court in order to testify as aforesaid.

14.	Local inspections

It shall be the duty of the court to make or cause to be made such local inspection as the circumstances of the case may require.

15.	Forms

Subject to the express provisions, if any, of these Rules, the forms contained in the Fifth Schedule to this Act may, in accordance with any instructions contained in the said forms, and with such variation as the circumstances of the particular case may require, be used in the case to which they apply, and when so used, shall be good and sufficient in law.

[Fifth Schedule.]

16.	Witness compellable in certain cases

(1)	Whenever two or more persons are summoned to appear before the Judge or charged with an of¬fence under this Act, the court may require one or more of them to give evidence as a witness.

(2)	A person who refuses to be sworn or to answer a lawful question after having been required to give evidence as a witness under paragraph (1) of this Rule, may be dealt with in the same manner as a witness refusing to do so in a High Court in Nigeria.

17.	Evidence of accomplices

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any law (including any rule of law) no witness shall, in a proceeding under this Act be presumed to be unworthy of credit by reason only that he took part in the grant¬ing of any loan and advance or the commission of any offence under this Act. 

18.	Application of Criminal Procedure Code or Act

Where these Rules contain no provision in respect of any matter relating to or connected with the trial of offences under this Act, the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code or, depending on the venue, the Criminal Procedure Act shall, with such modifications as the circumstances may require, apply in respect of such matter to the same extent as they apply to the trial of offences generally.

[Cap. C41.]

19.	Meaning of prosecutor

In these Rules, “prosecutor” means the Attorney-General of the Federation or any other person author¬ised by him pursuant to section 79 (1) of this Act to conduct the prosecution of an offence before the court or to assist therein.
