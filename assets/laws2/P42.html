CHAPTER P42

An Act to repeal all public order laws in the States of the Federation and to replace them with a Federal Act for the purpose of maintaining public order and to prohibit the formation of quasi-military organisations, regulate the use of uniforms, and other matters ancillary thereto.

[No. 5 of 1979.]

[Date of commencement: 16th February, 1979]

1.	Power to regulate assemblies, meetings and processions

(1)	For the purposes of the proper and peaceful conduct of public assemblies, meetings and proces-sions and subject to section 11 of this Act, the Governor of each State is hereby empowered to direct the conduct of all assemblies, meetings and processions on the public roads or places of public resort in the State and prescribe the route by which and the times at which any procession may pass.

(2)	Any person who is desirous of convening or collecting any assembly or meeting or of forming any procession in any public road or place of public resort shall, unless such assembly, meeting or pro-cession is permitted by a general licence granted under subsection (3) of this section, first make app-lication for a licence to the Governor not less than forty-eight hours thereto, and if such Governor is satisfied that the assembly, meeting or procession is not likely to cause a breach of the peace, he shall direct any superior police officer to issue a licence, not less than twenty-four hours thereto, specifying the name of the licensee and defining the conditions on which the assembly, meeting or procession

 is permitted to take place; and if he is not so satisfied, he shall convey his refusal in like manner to the applicant within the time hereinbefore stipulated.

(3)	The Governor may authorise the issue of general licences by any superior police officer men-tioned in subsection (4) of this section setting out the conditions under which and by whom and the place where any particular kind or description of assembly, meeting or procession may be convened, collected or formed.

(4)	The Governor may delegate his powers under this section—

(a)	in relation to the whole State or part thereof, to the Commissioner of Police of the State or any superior police officer of a rank not below that or a Chief Superintendent of Police; and

(b)	in relation to any local government area or part thereof, but subject to any delegation made under paragraph (a) above, to any superior police officer or any police officer for the time being acting as the District Police Officer,

and references in this section to the Governor shall be construed accordingly.

(5)	Any person—

(a)	aggrieved by any decision of the Commissioner of Police or any superior police officer under subsection (4) (a) of this section, may within fifteen days of such decision appeal to the Gov-ernor;

(b)	aggrieved by any decision of any police officer mentioned in subsection (4) (b) of this sec¬tion, may within fifteen days of such decision appeal to the Commissioner of Police and shall have a right of further appeal from any decision of the Commissioner of Police under this paragraph to the Governor,

and the Governor or, as the case may require, the Commissioner of Police, shall give a decision on any appeal lodged pursuant to this section not later than fifteen days after the date of its receipt by him.

(6)	The decision of the Governor under subsection (5) of this section shall be final and no further appeal shall lie therefrom.

2.	Power to stop assemblies, meetings and processions

Any police officer of the rank of inspector or above may stop any assembly, meeting or procession for which no licence has been issued or which violates any conditions of the licence issued under sec¬tion 1 of this Act, and may order any such assembly, meeting or procession which has been prohibited or which violates any such conditions as aforesaid to disperse immediately.

3.	Unlawful assemblies

Any assembly, meeting or procession which—

(a)	takes place without a licence issued under section 1 of this Act; or

(b)	violates any condition of any licence granted under section 1 as aforementioned; or

(c)	neglects to obey any order given under section 2 of this Act,

shall be deemed to be an unlawful assembly, and all persons taking part in such assembly, meeting or procession, and in the case of an assembly, meeting or procession for which no licence has been issued, all persons taking part in the convening, collecting or directing of the assembly, meeting, or procession, shall be guilty of an offence and liable on conviction to a fine of N1,000 or imprisonment for six months or to both such fine and imprisonment. 

4.	Power to issue proclamations, etc., for the preservation of public order

(1)	Notwithstanding any licence granted under section 1 of this Act, if a superior police officer, having regard to the time or place at which and the circumstances in which any public assembly, meeting or pro¬cession is taking place or is intended to take place (and in the case of a public procession to the route taken or proposed to be taken by the procession), has reasonable grounds for apprehending that the assembly or meeting or procession may occasion serious disorder, he may give direction imposing upon persons organ¬ising or taking part in the assembly or meeting or procession such conditions as appear to him necessary for the preservation of public order including, in the case of a public procession, conditions prescribing the route to be taken by the procession or conditions prohibiting the procession from entering any public place specified in the directions:

Provided that no conditions restricting the display of symbols or emblems shall be imposed under the provisions of this subsection except such as are reasonably necessary to prevent risk of a breach of the peace.

(2)	Subject to any order made by the Commissioner of Police under subsection (3) of this section, if at any time a superior police officer (including any police officer for the time being acting as a District Police Officer) is of opinion that by reason of particular circumstances existing in a local government area or part thereof, the powers conferred upon him by subsection (1) of this section will not be sufficient to prevent serious public disorder being occasioned by the holding of public assemblies, meetings or processions in the area concerned, such police officer may issue a proclamation in the Form contained in the Schedule to this Act, copies of which shall be displayed in all local government offices and police stations and posts in that area and in such other places as may be determined by him, prohibiting the holding in such area of all public assemblies, meetings or processions specified in the proclamation, for such period, not exceeding seven days, as may be so specified.

[Schedule.]

(3)	If at any time the Commissioner of Police is of opinion that by reason of particular circum-stances existing in the State or any part thereof, the powers conferred by subsections (1) and (2) of this section will not be sufficient to prevent serious public disorder being occasioned by the holding of pub¬lic assemblies, meetings or processions in the State or in any part thereof, the Commissioner may, after consultation with the Governor of the State, by order published in the State Gazette and in such other manner (including broadcasts by radio or television) as he may deem sufficient to bring the order to the knowledge of the general public in the State or in that part thereof to which it relates, prohibit the hold¬ing in the State or any such part of all public assemblies, meetings or processions specified in the order, for such period not exceeding fourteen days as may be so specified.

(4)	An order made under subsection (3) of this section shall have effect from the time when it is first published or publicly notified in any manner authorised by that subsection or from such later time as may be specified in the order, and a certificate under the hand of the Commissioner of Police who made the order specifying the time of publication or notification (other than a publication in the Gazette in respect of which the Evidence Act has made other provisions) shall be conclusive evidence thereof in all legal proceedings.

[Cap. E14.]

(5)	Any person who knowingly—

(a)	fails to comply with any directions given or conditions imposed under this section; or

(b)	organises or assists in organising any public assembly, meeting or procession held or in¬tended to be held in contravention of a proclamation or an order made under this section; or

 (whether or not members or adherents thereof) shall be admissible as evidence of the purposes for which, or the manner in which, such persons (including, where applicable, members or adherents of the association) were organised, or trained or equipped.

(5)	If a magistrate or Upper Area Court Judge is satisfied by information on oath that there is reason¬able ground for suspecting that an offence against this section has been committed, and that evidence of the commission thereof is to be found at any premises or place specified in the information, he may, on an ap¬plication made by a superior police officer, grant a search warrant authorising any such officer named in the warrant together with any other persons specified in the warrant and any other police officers to enter the premises or place at any time within seven days from the date of the warrant, if necessary by force, and to search the premises or place and every person found therein, and to seize anything found on the premises or place or on any such person which the officer has reasonable ground for suspecting to be evidence of the commission of such an offence as aforesaid:
