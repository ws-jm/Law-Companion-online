PART VII

Special and Restricted Methods of Procurement

39.	Two-stage tendering

(1)	Notwithstanding the provisions of this Act, the Bureau may issue a Certificate of “No Objec¬tion” upon conditions hereinafter prescribed.

(2)	A procuring entity shall engage in procurement by two-stage tendering—

(a)	where it is not feasible for the procuring entity to formulate detailed specifications for the goods or works or, in the case of services, to identify their characteristics and where it seeks tenders, proposals or offers on various means of meeting its needs in order to obtain the most satisfactory solution to its procurement needs;

(b)	where the character of the goods or works are subject to rapid technological advances, where the procuring entity seeks to enter into a contract for research, experiment, study or devel-opment, except where the contract includes the production of goods in sufficient quantities to establish their commercial viability or to recover research and development costs, where the procuring entity applies this Act to procurement concerned with national security and deter-mines that the selected method is the most appropriate method of procurement; or 

(c)	where the tender proceedings have been utilised but were not successful or the tenders were rejected by the procuring entity under an open competitive bid procedure and the procuring entity considers that engaging in new tendering proceedings will not result in a procurement contract.

(3)	The provisions of this Act as regards the process for open competitive bidding shall apply to two-stage tendering proceedings except to the extent that those provisions vary from this section.

(4)	The invitation documents—

(a)	shall call upon suppliers or contractors to submit, in the first stage of two-stage tendering proceedings, initial tenders which contain their proposals without a tender price; and

(5)	The procuring entity may, in the first stage, engage in negotiations with any supplier or contrac¬tor whose tender has not been rejected under an open competitive bidding procedure with respect to any aspect of its tender.

(6)	In the second stage of the two tender proceedings the procuring entity—

(?)	shall invite suppliers or contractors whose tenders have not been rejected to submit final ten-ders with prices on a single set of specifications;

(b)	may, in formulating the specifications, delete or modify any aspect of the technical or quality characteristics of the goods, works or services to be procured together with any criterion originally set out in these documents, evaluate and compare tenders and ascertain the suc-cessful tender;

(c)	may add new characteristics or criteria that conform with this Act;

(d)	shall communicate to suppliers or contractors in the invitation to submit firm tenders, any deletion, modification or addition; and

(e)	may permit a supplier or contractor who does not wish to submit a final tender to withdraw from the tendering proceedings.

(7)	The final tenders shall be evaluated and compared in order to ascertain the successful tender as defined in an open competitive bid.

40.	Restricted tendering

(1)	Subject to the approval by the Bureau, a procuring entity may for reasons of economy and effi-ciency engage in procurement by means of restricted tendering if—

(a)	the goods, works or services are available only from a limited number of suppliers or con-tractors;

(b)	the time and cost required to examine and evaluate a large number of tenders is dispropor-tionate to the value of the goods, works or services to be procured; or

(c)	the procedure is used as an exception rather than a norm.

(2)	Where a procuring entity engages in restricted tendering on the basis that—

(a)    the goods, works and services are available only from a limited number of suppliers or con-tractors, it shall invite tenders from all the suppliers and contractors who can provide the goods, works or services; and

(b)	the time and cost required to examine and evaluate a large number of tenders is dispropor-tionate to the value of the goods, works or services, it shall select in a non-discriminatory manner of the number of suppliers or contractors to ensure effective competition. 

(3)	For the purposes of subsection (2), the procuring entity shall cause a notice of the selected ten-dering proceedings to be published in the procurement journal.

(4)	No negotiation shall take place between a procuring entity and a contractor or supplier with re-spect to a quotation.

(5)	The procurement shall be awarded to the qualified contractor or supplier that gives the lowest priced responsive quotation.

(1)	A procuring entity may carry out any emergency procurement where—

(a)	goods, works or services are only available from a particular supplier or contractor, or if a particular supplier or contractor has exclusive rights in respect of the goods, works or ser¬vices, and no reasonable alternative or substitute exists;

(b)	there is an urgent need for the goods, works or services and engaging in tender proceedings or any other method of procurement is impractical due to unforeseeable circumstances giving rise to the urgency which is not the result of dilatory conduct on the part of the procuring entity;

(c)	owing to a catastrophic event, there is an urgent need for the goods, works or services, mak-ing it impractical to use other methods of procurement because of the time involved in using those methods;

(d)	a procuring entity which has procured goods, equipment, technology or services from a sup-plier or contractor, determines that—

    (i)     additional supplies need to be procured from that supplier or contractor because of standardisation;

(iv)	the reasonableness of the price and the unsuitability of alternatives to the goods or services in question merits the decision;

(e)	the procuring entity seeks to enter into a contract with the supplier or contractor for research, experiment, study or development, except where the contract includes the production of goods in quantities to establish commercial viability or recover research and development costs; or

(2)	The procuring entity—

(a)	may procure the goods, works or services by inviting a proposal or price quotation from a single supplier or contractor;

(b)	shall include in the record of procurement proceedings a statement of the grounds for its de-cision and the circumstances in justification of single-source procurement.

PART IV

Principles and Methods of Consultants Selection

(43)	Scope of Consulting Services.—Procuring Entities may need consulting services for a variety of needs in engineering, architecture, economics and finance, management of projects and procurement, or a combination thereof. Consulting services may be classified into the following categories—

(a)	Advisory or Counselling Services, including staffing, training and institution building and

specific advice on issues and projec(b)	Pre-Investment Studies, including identification, pre-feasibility and feasibility studies, in-cluding regional or sectoral planning, policy and investment priorities.

(c)	Engineering and Design Studies, to define the scope and design of a project, such as the preparation of drawings, specifications, detailed cost estimates and complete tender docu-ments for the invitation of bids for construction and/or equipment procurement. In addition, these services may include assistance in the pre-qualification of contractors, analysis of bids and recommendations on the award of contracts, and drawing up final contract provisions with the selected contractor.

(d)      Implementation or Supervision Services, to ensure execution of the project in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract, manage expenditure control, and provide certi-fication of materials, quantities and invoices submitted by the contractors and suppliers. Such services may also include introducing modifications in the design or specifications, as neces¬sary, upon prior agreement with the Procuring Entity or the owner of the project.

(e)	Project Management, where the Procuring Entity engages a Project Management Consultant to undertake the overall responsibility for planning, design, procurement, construction and commissioning of a project. The Project Management Consultant acts as the Procuring En-tity’s executing arm in all matters connected with the implementation of a project. There is no uniform pattern according to which services under this category are rendered: sometimes a consultant may be engaged to act as the sole project consultant often with vast powers; or an independent consultant may be appointed under a project manager and be entrusted with the discharge of specific tasks.

(f)      In addition, the Procuring Entity may also need specialist services to assist it in the prepara¬tion and appraisal of projects, and the supervision and evaluation of on-going projects or to provide advice on technical matters.

Types of Consultants

(44)	Consultants, to who these Regulations apply, may be grouped into one or a combination of the following—

(a)	independent consulting firms (business and/or professional partnerships, private companies or corporations, operating internationally or nationally, financial institutions and procure¬ment agents);

(b)	autonomous/semi-autonomous government organisations, multilateral-agencies, or non-governmental organisations (NGOs);

(c)	universities/research institutes;

(d)	consulting firms forming part of, or otherwise affiliated to, or associated with, or owned by

contractors or manufacturers; or consulting firms combining the functions of consultants with those of contractors/manufacturers (see paragraphs	on conflicts of in¬-

terest); and

(e)	individual consultants.

Training and Transfer of Technology

(45)	If the consulting assignment includes an important component for training or transfer of knowledge, the terms of reference shall indicate the objectives, nature, scope, and goals of the training programme, including details on trainers and trainees, skills to be transferred, time frame, and monitor-ing and evaluation arrangements. The cost for the training programme shall be included in the budget for the assignment and the consultant’s contract.

Criteria for Selection of Consultants

(46)	Subject to such other regulations as may herein be prescribed by the Bureau—

(a)  price shall not be the sole criteria for the selection of Bidders for the provision of consulting service
(b)	The selection of consultants shall be based on the numerically weighted assessment of the

experience, performances, quality of personnel, price and methodology, such as to rank the. Bids from highest to lowest in terms of their calculated ratings. The Bid with the highest cal-culated rating shall be the “Highest Rated/Evaluated Bid”.

(47)	Procedure for Consultant Selection.—Every Procuring Entity shall proceed to selection of consulting firms by conducting activity in the following order—

(h)	public opening of the financial proposals;

(i)      evaluation of the financial proposals;

(j)     selection of the best ranking proposal, followed by negotiations with the selected consultant; and

(k)	awarding the contract to the selected consultant and signing it.

(48)	The Terms of Reference (TOR).—(1) The TOR shall define the work that the consultant is re-quired to perform.
(2) Every TOR shall indicate—

(a)	the scope and objective of the project;

(b)	the relevant background, including available studies, of the project and institutions concerned;

(c)	the type of services required and objectives sought;

(d)	the schedules of implementation and expected outputs (periodic reports, documents and end products);

(e)	the scope and nature of transfer of technology and training, if required;

(f)	the method of remuneration for the services;

(g)	the responsibilities of the Procuring Entity (client) and those of the consultant;

(k)	  an indication if “supplementary work” will be required (such as detailed engineering after the

feasibility study, supervision of implementation after detailed engineering), when continuity is essential. If this possibility is part of the project, the Procuring Entity shall indicate clearly in the RfP the scope and requirements for this follow-up assignment. Short listed consultants shall duly respond to the criteria of this assignment, to arrive at an equitable and transparent selection during proposal evaluation and to enable the Procuring Entity to negotiate a suit¬able contract for the follow-up assignment with the selected consultant when the situation arises.

(l)       All other important elements considered necessary to enable the consultant to submit a com-prehensive proposal and estimate of the cost.

(49)	TOR for Complex assignments.—TORs for assignments of a complex nature such as might re-quire research and innovation to achieve the aims of the assignment may be issued stipulating the al-lowance for the consultants to propose suitable approaches and methodology to meet the aims of the Procuring Entity.

(50)	Preparation of complex TORs.—Where a Procuring Entity does not have the capacity to pre¬pare the TORs for a complex assignment, it may engage a specialist with the requisite qualifications to prepare such a TOR in accordance with the Regulations for Individual Consultants (Section V).

(51)	Description of Services.—The TOR and any modifications agreed at the negotiation stage shall constitute the “Description of Services” in the contract between the consultant and the Procuring Entity.

(52)	Cost Estimate (Budget).—The Procuring Entity shall estimate the cost of a proposed consulting assignment, including—

(a)       the estimated resources needed for the assignment (level and type of personnel, realistic staff time, physical outputs and logistical support, if needed (such as vehicles, office supplies and computer equipment);

Selection Methods

(53)	Quality and Cost-Based Selection - QCBS.—The Procuring Entity shall use any of the follow¬ing selection methods—

(a)      selection based on the technical quality with price consideration. Using this method, quality and price factors are combined and weighted in varying proportions depending on the impor¬tance of the quality versus price. The weight given to price in the overall ranking of the consultants shall depend on the technical complexity of the assignment and the nature of the project. Careful consideration shall be given to evaluations to assure that price considerations do not compromise quality. Generally, the proportional weights shall be set at eighty points for quality and twenty points for price, but could be seventy and thirty points, respectively, for assignments of standard or routine nature, or conversely ninety and ten points respec¬tively, for assignments where technical quality is of critical importance. Only the technical proposals which have passed the minimum technical mark set in the RfP will proceed to the financial evaluation. The required methodology shall be explained in the RfP.

[Section 51.]

for which the budget is fixed and cannot be increased.

(e)	Consultants Qualification Selection - CQS.—Selection based on the Consultants’ Qualifica-tions, for smaller assignments, where the selection procedure only comprises the comparison of the most appropriate qualification and references. The selected most qualified consulting firm is requested to prepare a technical and financial proposal on the basis of detailed TOR. For this procedure, only a simplified RfP is required.

(f)	Sole-Source Selection {or Direct Contracting) - SSS.—Allowed only in exceptional circum¬

stances, subject to BPP prior certification and generally for small assignments only.

(63)	In accordance with section 41, the Procuring Entity shall for all selection methods subject to competition (that is except for CQS and SSS), grade the technical criteria on a scale of zero to one hun-dred points. This grading scale is detailed in the Specific Instructions of the RfP. The points attributed to each evaluation criteria are a function of the importance of each criterion for the assignment and may be adjusted as necessary.

As an example, the following range shall be used for domestic short-lists—

		Example

Grading Scale of Technical Quality	Range	1	2

Consultants qualifications and experience relevant to the assignment	5-10 points	10	10

Methodology, Approach (understanding of the TOR), Work Plan	20-50 points	50	30

Qualifications of key personnel	130-60 points	30	55

Transfer of Technology (training) (if asked for in the RfP)	0-10 points	10	5

Total (not to exceed)	100 points	100	100

For shortlists involving international consultants, the scale might be as follows:

		Example

Grading Scale of Technical Quality	Range	1	2

Consultants qualifications and experience relevant to the assignment	5-10 points	05	05

Methodology, Approach (understanding of the TOR), Work Plan	20-50 points	50	30

Qualifications of key personnel	30-60 points	30	45

Transfer of Technology (training) (if asked for in the RfP)	0-10 points	05	10

Use of Domestic Consultants	0-10 points	10	10

Total (not to exceed)	100 points	100	100

(64)	The allocation of points to the above factors will differ for the type of assignment. For assign-ments of detailed engineering and design (example 1), greater weight shall be given to the consultant’s proven experience and past performance, and relatively lesser weight shall be given to key staff, be¬cause such assignments are mostly carried out at a consultant’s home office. For an assignment for con-struction supervision and implementation services (example 2), the quality of key staff is much more important, since it has a direct bearing on supervision and management of the works, quality of per-formance and quality control, as well as transfer of technology/know-how.

(65)	The Procuring Entity’s Specific Instructions in the RfP may divide the above main criteria into sub-criteria, each of which shall be awarded subpoints, also weighed on a scale of zero to one hundred (e.g. for “methodology and work plan”, the sub-criteria may be “innovation” and “relevance of detail”.) However, the number of sub-criteria should be kept to a minimum (generally not more than three) to avoid that the evaluation becomes too mechanical and a “numbers game”. Sub-criteria are also custom-ary for the proposed key staff (e.g. general qualifications and experience, adequacy for the assignment, leadership role in the area of the assignment, knowledge of the region, language proficiency, etc.).

(66)	Types of Consulting Contracts.—When preparing the RfP, the Procuring Entity shall select the type of contract to be used for the consulting assignment. The Procuring Entity shall select the most appropriate one of the standard form of contracts for consultants’ services as prepared by the BPP.

(67)	These standard form of contracts shall be as contained in Annex 2—

(a)	lump sum contracts for complex assignments;

(b)	lump sum contracts for simple assignments;

(c)	time-based contracts for complex assignments;

(d)	time-based contracts for simple assignments;

(e)	lump-sum and time-based contracts for individual consultants.

(68)	Request for Expressions of Interest to be advertised.—The Procuring Entity shall advertise re-quests for “expressions of interest” (Eol) from interested firms in at least two widely distributed publi-cations, the procurement journal, and on the Procuring Entity’s website.

[Sections 44 (a), (b) and 46.]

(69)	To enable the Procuring Entity to evaluate the Eol submissions and draw-up a shortlist, the Request for Eols shall list explicit criteria of the assignment including—

(a)     a statement of the subject and main elements of the assignment and the timeframe for con¬duct of the assignment;

(b)	stipulations for consultants to provide details (technical and financial) of the core business of their organisation and years of experience, relevant experience in assignments of similar na-ture, references that can attest of successful completion, key personnel available for the as-signment, and any other information that may show the consultant’s ability to carry out the assignment satisfactorily;

(c)	the name, telephone, fax number, website, e-mail address and physical address of the Procur-ing Entity and the responsible contact person;

(d)	Stating the time for response to the Eol (not less than fourteen days from publication).

(70)	Analysis of the Eol and Short-Listing of Consultants.—The Procuring Entity shall analyse the Expressions of Interest and the responses of the consultants, dividing the responses into “responsive” and “non-responsive”.

(72)	The “responsive” Eols shall be those which meet or are nearest to meeting the minimum level of experience or capacity expected of consultants by the Procuring Entity. A short-list of the best rank¬ing candidates is then drawn up from the list of responsive Eols such that there are six candidates.

(EDITORIAL NOTE: Numbering as per Gazette.)

(73)	Finality of Shortlists.—Contracts estimated to cost less than N250 million, the shortlist can be made of only national consultants if there are enough qualified firms in that assignment

(74)	A shortlist shall be drawn up only after the deadline for the submissions of Eols. Once the Procuring Entity has drawn up a shortlist no further application from other firms or individuals shall be considered and the Procuring Entity shall not add or delete names without BPP’s prior approval.

(75)	Joint Ventures.—Consulting firms may enter into associations with one or more other firms to enhance their technical capacity. Such associations may be either for the long term or for a specific as-signment.

(76)	Such associations may take different forms and constitute—

(a)	a joint venture, whereby all members are jointly and severally liable for the entire contract, and all members are required to sign the contract with the client; or 

(b)	a subcontracting arrangement, whereby the lead-firm assumes complete responsibility for and coordination of the intellectual services and signs the contract with the client, while the subcontractor only executes part of the contract assigned to it under specific terms of refer-ence, and for this purpose signs a subcontract with the lead firm.

(77)	After the shortlist is finalised and the RfP is issued any form of joint venture, other associa¬tion, or subcontracting among the short-listed consultants, as well as with non-short-listed consultants, shall be allowed only with the approval of the Procuring Entity, and must be communicated in writing to the Procuring Entity at least fourteen days before the Proposal submission date and in accordance with the provisions of the RfP.

(78)	Non-domestic consulting firms may associate with one or more domestic consulting firms. However, no Procuring Entity may stipulate conditions which require mandatory joint ventures or other forms of associations between specific consulting firms. Procuring entities intending joint ventures be-tween non-domestic and domestic consulting firms should include a statement to that effect in the EoI for the assignment.

(79)	Letter of Invitation (LoI) in the RfP.—The Procuring Entity shall ensure that the “Letter, of In-vitation” (LoI) includes the following—

(?)	the subject of the assignment;

(b)	a statement that the trancing of the assignment is provided for in the budget of the Procure-ment Entity;

(c)	a statement that the LoI is a formal invitation to submit proposals to undertake the assignment;

(d)	a statement that a consulting firm shall be selected on a competitive basis;

(e)	the selection method;

(f)	the details of the Procuring Entity;

(g)	the names of the short-listed consultants;

(h)	the list of the documents attached (Instructions to Consultants, TOR, Standard Forms for the technical and financial proposals, and the draft Standard Contract) on the basis of which the proposals shall be formulated;

(i)      an indication if it is a fixed price consultancy or if the duration of the assignment may be longer than eighteen months, and will be subject to price adjustment;

(j)	the deadline for proposal submission;

(k)	if the submission procedure will include a pre-proposal meeting;

(l)     a statement that the invited consultants are requested to respond immediately to the Procuring Entity that they are interested to submit a proposal for the assignment or that they decline.

[Section 46.]

(80)	Instructions to Shortlisted Consultants (ITC) in the RfP.—All RfPs shall be accompanied by “Instructions to Consultants” (ITC 1) and associated Specific Instructions which shall—

(a)	define the procedure, place and period for proposal submission (between thirty to ninety days depending on complexity);

(b)	indicate the proposal validity period (normally sixty to one hundred and twenty calendar days). It is important to define a realistic validity period to avoid that at negotiations the con-sultant substitutes key staff proposed and evaluated;

(c)	provide the details needed for responsive proposals, including the evaluation criteria and respective weights of technical and financial proposals;

(d)	state the minimum technical quality passing score;

(e)	provide information on the eligibility and association of consulting firms;

(f)       indicate the language of communication;

(g)	schedule visits to the project site if required ;

(h)	give the date and time of a pre-proposal meeting (in the case of a complex assignment requir-ing clarifications on site), and

(i)    explain the procedures for the proposal opening and evaluation, contract negotiations and contract award, and state clearly that the technical proposal should not contain any informa-tion on the financial proposal.

[Section 48.]

(81)	Draft Contract to be included in RfP.—Procuring Entities shall adapt the Standard Contracts for consulting services provided by the BPP and attached to these Regulations as Annex

[Section 48 (1).]

(82)	The draft contract for each assignment shall be included in the RfP as an annexure.

(83)	Contents of the Standard Contract.—The Standard Contracts shall include the flowing Clauses—

(a)	General Conditions of Contract between the Procurement Entity and the Consultant, which comprise the standard contract provisions;

(b)	Special Conditions of Contract, indicating the requirements specific to the implementation of the assignment. Modifications to the General Conditions of Contract shall only be introduced through the Special Conditions of Contract. Different forms of contract are explained in An-nex 2. In the rare circumstances that the Standard Contract is not applicable, Procuring Enti-ties may use other forms of contract subject to prior approval by the BPP;

(c)	Contract duration: if a contract is expected to exceed eighteen months, a price adjustment formula shall be included in the Special Conditions of contact to adjust the remuneration for foreign and/or local inflation. If price adjustment is indicated in the Specific Instructions of the ITC, it shall not be part of the financial evaluation.

(d)	Clear payment provisions, which shall be agreed upon during contract negotiations. Pay¬ments may be on a lump sum basis (lump sum contracts based on outputs) or on a monthly basis (“time-based” contracts based on actual time spent but limited to a ceiling, which is the contract price)—

 (i)    design and detailed engineering shall normally be remunerated on a lump sum basis;

(ii)	supervision services are time-based contracts.

(e)	Mobilisation fees: Such advances shall not exceed fifteen per cent of the contract value for national consultants and ten per cent for foreign consultants. In all cases advances shall be covered by a bank guarantee acceptable to the Procuring Entity. The mechanism for the re-covery of the advance shall be clearly spelled out in the contract.(84)	Cost estimate of the assignment.—Except in the case of the Fixed Budget selection method, the RfP does not provide the estimated budget cost, only the estimated input of professional staff time. However, the Procuring Entity shall always prepare its own detailed cost estimate for the assignment, taking into account the estimated staff time and prevailing market rates for consultants, and the likely reimbursable costs such as travel, per diem, office rent, communication costs, computer costs, report production, printing and dissemination, and insurance. It will need this cost estimate to compare with the financial proposals. Consultants shall be free to submit their own estimates.

(85)	Procedure for the Rejection of Proposals.—Procuring entities may reject all proposals submit-ted by consultants on the grounds of being non-responsive if—

(a)    None of the proposals meet the objectives of the TOR. In this case, the Procuring Entity shall improve the clarity of the TOR and issue new requests for proposals to the same firms or to a newly drawn-up shortlist.

(b)     All proposals are below the minimum qualifying mark for technical quality. In this case, the Eol shall be re-advertised and a new shortlist of consultants other than had earlier responded shall be compiled.

(c)	All financial proposals substantially exceed the budget estimate. In such cases, the Procuring Entities increase the budget if it determines that the costs estimates were too low, or scale down the scope of the services requested, or cancel the assignment altogether if it is not un-economical to continue,

(86)	In all cases where all proposals are subject to rejection, the Procuring Entity shall first obtain approval of the BPP and thereafter inform the competing consultants accordingly.

(87)	Only one Proposal Received.—If only one short-listed firm has responded or remains as the only responsive firm among the proposals received, it may still be considered that a competitive proce-dure has taken place. The Procuring Entity may evaluate the sole consultant’s proposals, and, if satis-factory, invite it for contract negotiations, or continue with the one remaining candidate to negotiations and contract award.

(88)	Insufficient Competition.—If no responses are received within the proposal submission period stipulated in the RfP, the Procuring Entity shall review the possible causes, and reformulate the RfP, in-cluding the estimated staff-time, or draw up a new shortlist, or both, and recommence the procedure. If the procedure is subject to prior review, the Procuring Entity shall do so after certification by the BPP. If, after a second call, there is still no response, the Procuring Entity may seek BPP approval to direct contracting of a qualified firm, based on the original RfP and submission of satisfactory technical and financial pro¬posals.

PART VI

Procedures for Proposal Preparation, Submission, Opening, Evaluation, Negotiation, Award and

Contract Signature with Firms

(89)	Preparation and Submission of the Proposals.—Procuring Entities shall allow sufficient time for consultants to submit their proposals in response to the RfP. Depending on the complexity of the assignment, the period for submission shall not be less than thirty and no more than ninety calendar days. Any proposal received after the closing time for the submission of proposals shall be returned unopened.

[Section 48(1) to (3).] 

(90)	Requests for clarifications by shortlisted candidates before submission.—Up to fourteen days be¬fore the proposal submission date, shortlisted candidates may request clarifications in writing (facsimile or electronic mail) on any of the RfP documents. The Procuring Entity shall respond to such requests, with¬out identifying the source, within seven working days by similar method, and simultaneously copy the clarification to the shortlisted consultants.

[Section 47(1).]

(91)	Procuring Entities shall refrain from communicating with prospective candidates after publica-tion of the RfP other than as provided for in the Regulations under this paragraph or in the event of pre--proposal meetings.

(92)	Pre-proposal Meeting.—For complex consulting contracts, a pre-proposal meeting may be ar-ranged whereby potential candidate consultants meet with the representatives of the Procuring Entity to seek clarifications. Minutes of the meeting shall be provided to all prospective candidates (including those who did not attend) and be duly recorded in the records of the Procuring Entity. Any additional information, clarification, correction of errors or modifications of the RfP shall be sent to each short¬listed candidate in sufficient time before the proposal submission deadline to enable candidates to take appropriate action. If necessary, the Procuring Entity shall extend the submission deadline.

[Section 47 (4).]

(93)	Modification of the RfP by the Procuring Entity.—If needed or for purposes of the Procuring entity, the Procuring Entity may modify the RfP by issuing an addendum up to fourteen days before the submission deadline. The Procuring Entity may extend the deadline for proposal submission, and if the procedure is subject to prior review by the BPP, do so with prior concurrence of the BPP.

[Section 47 (2).]

(94)	Proposal modification or withdrawal by the shortlisted candidate.—A candidate may modify or withdraw its proposal prior to the submission deadline in accordance with the provisions in the RfP.

[Section 29 (4).]

(95)	Currency.—Domestic consultants shall express their financial proposals in naira, If interna-tional consultants are on the shortlist, they may express their foreign cost in a convertible international currency; however local costs shall be quoted in naira. For purposes of the evaluation and comparison of costs, the RfP shall state that the source for the conversion of price proposals to naira shall be the medium exchange rate of the Central Bank of Nigeria on the date of proposal submission. The RfP shall indicate that all payments shall be made in naira.

[Section 46 (1).]

(96)	Validity of Proposals.—Consultants shall be required to submit proposals valid for a period specified in the RfP, sufficient to enable the Procuring Entity to complete the comparison and evalua¬tion of proposals, obtain the necessary approvals from BPP, if required, so that the award of contract can be effected within that period. The validity period should normally be from a minimum of sixty to one hundred and twenty days from proposal submission through evaluation, contract award and signa¬ture, depending on the complexity of the proposal.

[Section 48 (1).]
(97)	Extension of Validity of Tenders.—If an extension of proposal validity becomes necessary due to unforeseen difficulties in the proposal evaluation and award process, the Procuring Entity shall re¬quest the candidates in writing for their agreement before the expiration of the validity period stated in the Request for Proposals. The extension shall be for the minimum period required to complete the evaluation, obtain the necessary approvals and award the contract. If additional extensions are needed, prior no-objection of the BPP shall be requested stating the reasons for the requested extension.

[Section 29).]

(98)	Whenever an extension of the proposal validity period is requested, candidates shall not be asked or permitted to change the quoted (base) price or other conditions of their proposal.

(99)	Procedures for Proposal Submission.—The procedures for submission of proposals are de-scribed in the Standard RfP. Proposals shall be—

(a)    properly identified by the candidates in order not to be mistaken with proposals for other assignments;

(b)       signed by a legal person who is authorised to bind the firm; and;

(c)	technical and financial bids shall be delivered simultaneously at the location indicated in the RfP, in two separate sealed envelopes, enclosed inside a third sealed envelope, and no later than at the stipulated time.

[Section 48 (1) and (2).]

(100)	No amendment to either proposal shall be admitted thereafter.

(101)	The Procuring Entity shall register the proposals received, issue a receipt for them, and verify that each proposal contains the technical and financial proposals in sealed envelopes. It will place them in a tamper-proof location. Proposals received after the deadline shall be returned unopened to the con-sultant. Proposal opening shall start immediately following proposal submission or if held at a different location, only with the difference of time needed to transport the proposals to the opening location.

(102)	Appointment of Evaluation Committee(s).—No later than two weeks before the proposal submission date, the Procuring Entity shall constitute an evaluation committee of at least three experts in the subject of the assignment, headed by a chairperson, to carry out the technical and financial pro¬posal evaluation. The Procuring Entity shall ensure that the members of the evaluation committee pos¬sess the necessary technical and financial competence to evaluate the proposals, and include the person who drafted the TOR and the selection criteria for the RfP2. The technical and evaluation committees may consist of the same members or be supplemented by professionals specialised in each field of evaluation. At least a week before the evaluation starts, the team members shall meet to familiarise themselves with the background documentation and the evaluation procedures. If the Procuring Entity does not possess the qualified evaluation staff it should consider appointing independent experts from other Procuring Entities or hire individual consultants. For the purpose of evaluation, the Procuring Entity shall use BPP’s Standard Consultants Proposal Evaluation Report.

[Section 21 (f).]

(103)	Confidentiality of the Evaluation and Selection Procedure.—The Procuring Entity shall en-sure that throughout the evaluation procedure, information on evaluation results and recommendations shall not be disclosed to anyone but those officially concerned until the successful consultant is notified of the contract award.
[Section 52 (4).]

(104)	Proposal Opening.—Immediately following the deadline of the submission of proposals, the Procuring Entity shall first open the technical proposals. The Procuring Entity shall prepare minutes of the technical proposal opening for its record and sends a copy to the BPP. The Procuring Entity shall ensure that the financial proposals remain sealed and deposited in a safe box with the Procuring Entity’s designated authority and that no one has access to the financial proposals until their public opening. The proposal opening procedure is the same for QCBS, LCS, FBS, and for QBS only as far as the tech¬nical proposals are concerned.

[Section 48 (4) and (5).]

A.	Evaluation Procedure for the Quality and Cost Based Selection (QCBS)

(105)	Preliminary Examination.—The Technical Evaluation Committee shall first carry out a pre-liminary evaluation to determine if the technical proposals are substantially responsive i.e. by assuring that—

(a)    the technical proposal has been properly signed, responds to the terms of reference, responds to all components of the TOR, the CVs of key staff included with the original copy has been signed by the individuals and are they initialed by the consulting firm, and lastly that the technical proposal is generally in good order.

(106)	Rejection of grounds of major deviation.—If upon opening a technical proposal a major de-viation is found, the technical proposal concerned will not be further evaluated and shall be marked “rejected” and a statement to that effect made in the technical evaluation report. A major deviation would have occurred if any one or more of the following situations arise, i.e.—

(a)	if the original copy of proposal has not been signed;

(b)	the CVs in the original copy have not been signed by the firm and individual;

(c)	the proposal does not respond to the Terms of Reference.

(107)	Procuring Entity may request clarifications after submission of proposals.—If a Procuring Entity deems it necessary to seek clarifications from a candidate after technical proposal opening, can-didates shall not be asked to alter their proposals, or to change the substance of their technical propos¬als. A Procuring Entity may need to ask clarifications, for example in the event that some pages of sup-porting information (CVs) are not initialed, if required in the RfP, or if the candidate has not sent the required number of copies or omitted a form. Requests for clarification and the candidates’ responses shall be made in writing and any discrepancies noted shall be recorded in the technical evaluation re¬port.

(108)	Detailed technical evaluation.—The evaluation committee’s team leader prepares a table in the form of a matrix with rows representing the technical selection criteria to measure the strengths and weaknesses of each technical proposal using the points attributed to each criterion in the RfP. The committee members then review the firm’s relevant experience for the assignment, the firm’s profi¬ciency supported by written references of successful completion of similar assignments, the proposed methodology and work plan, the qualifications and proficiency key staff and their curricula vitae, which it may wish to verify for accuracy and completeness. Each committee member shall award scores to each technical criterion stated in the matrix in accordance with the points given in the RfP, rank the candidate’s technical proposal, and initial the individual evaluation sheet. Then the committee as a whole shall review the individual scores, and agree on the ranking of each candidate in accordance with the scores obtained. Major differences in the individual scores should be discussed and ironed out. The committee team leader then calculates the average of the individual scores for each criterion and pre-pares  

the combined technical evaluation and ranking sheet. After verification by the committee members, each member initials the combined evaluation sheet.

(109)	Technical Evaluation Report.—The committee shall prepare a Technical Evaluation Report describing the evaluation procedure and attach the minutes of the opening of the technical proposals, as well as the individual and combined evaluation sheets. The Report is submitted to the designated au-thority of the Procuring Entity for approval. If the assignment is subject to a monetary threshold, the Report shall be submitted to the BPP with a recommendation for “No Objection”. After approval of the Technical Evaluation Report by the relevant Approving Authority, the technical ratings cannot be changed.

(110)	Proposals not meeting the qualifying technical mark.—Only the proposals of the candidates that pass the minimum technical qualifying mark will move on to the financial evaluation. All proposals falling below the qualifying mark or were not responsive shall be eliminated and not given further con-sideration.

[Section 51 (3).]

(111)	Financial proposals of unsuccessful technical proposals.—Not later than fourteen days after the approval/no objection of the technical evaluation report, the Procuring Entity shall advise the un-successful candidates in writing of the decision and simultaneously return their financial proposals un-opened.

(112)	Invitation for public opening of the financial proposals.—The opening of the financial pro-posals shall be held not later than fourteen days after the technical evaluation is approved by the Ten-ders Board or the receipt of the BPP’s No Objection. The Procuring Entity shall advise the successful consultants of the date and venue of the public opening of the financial proposals and invite them to attend or send representatives.

(113)	Opening of the Financial Proposals.—The Procuring Entity shall appoint the same or a dif-ferent evaluation committee with qualified professionals to carry out the evaluation of the financial proposals.

(114)	The Procuring Entity shall proceed to the public opening of the financial proposals by—

(a)	allowing participating consultants to verify that the sealed financial envelopes have not been tampered with;

(b)	announcing the technical quality scores of the remaining candidates, and enunciates the price of each financial proposal;

(c)	Ensuring that attendees representing the candidates sign the register of public opening.

(115)	Minutes.—The proceedings of the financial opening are recorded in minutes, which shall be sent to the candidates and published on the Procuring Entity’s website and the Procurement Journal. A copy is sent to the BPP for information, and later on attached to the Financial Evaluation Report.

[Section 51 (5).]

(116)	Preliminary examination of the financial.—The financial evaluation committee shall first verify if the proposals contain the required financial forms and if the financial proposal forms are signed. If the submission form is not present or has not been signed, the proposal shall be rejected.
(117)	Detailed Evaluation of financial proposals.—The evaluation committee then proceeds to ver¬ify—

(a)	if the proposals contain any arithmetical errors, corrects them, and conveys them to the can-didates concerned for review and agreement. If a candidate does not accept the correction, its proposal shall be rejected;

(b)	that the financial strength of the firm and its working capital are adequate to carry out the assignment. For the purpose of comparing the cost of the proposals, corrected as the case may be, the costs shall be converted into naira at the medium exchange rate quoted by the Central Bank of Nigeria at the date indicated in the Specific Instructions of the RfP;

(c)	that the consultants proposed payment terms, required mobilisation fee and other terms agree to the draft Special Conditions of Contract which as attached to the RfP.

(118)	Local Taxes.—Financial proposals shall generally consist of two components—

(a)	the consultants’ fees, and

(b)	its reimbursable expenses such as travel, office renting and supplies, translation, report print¬ing and secretarial services. Where the RfP requires that the Consultants separately identify any foreign or local taxes (indirect and direct) and customs duties on imported equipment and supplies, these costs shall not be considered in the financial evaluation because they are difficult to specify, may be different from consultant to consultant, and would, therefore, dis-tort the comparability of the proposals.

(119)	Financial proposals to cover technical proposals.—The committee shall verify that the fi-nancial proposal covers all elements of the technical proposal (in particular the staff time needed to bring the assignment to a successful completion) particularly to ensure that the financial proposal ade¬quately reflects the technical commitments and output of the consultant.

If some technical inputs are not costed or the staff time needed to carry out the assignment is clearly underestimated to favour the proposal’s financial rating, the committee shall adjust the cost of the pro-posal, using the cost elements of the proposal concerned or an average cost of the same elements of other proposals. Such adjustments, as well as any arithmetical corrections, shall be explained in the committee’s financial evaluation report. If training and transfer of technology are included in the TOR, the committee shall verify if sufficient funds have been budgeted in the proposals.

(120)	Margin of preference for domestic consultants.—If a shortlist consists of domestic and inter-national consultants, a Procuring Entity may apply a margin of preference to the financial proposal of a domestic consultant in accordance with BPP Regulations, provided the allowance for such margin of preference was indicated in the RfP.

[Section 49 (2).]

Financial Scores and Ranking

The lowest evaluated financial proposal is given a score of 100 and the scores of the other proposals are calculated by dividing the lowest cost proposal by the price of the respective other proposals, as follows: Sf = 100 x Fm/F, in which Sf is the financial score, Fm is the lowest price and F the price of the proposal under consideration. The Evaluation Committee finalises its ranking of the candidates’ financial proposals accordingly and describes its financial evaluation procedure in its Financial Evalua-tion Report.

Combined technical and Financial Evaluation Report

On the basis of the technical and Financial Evaluation Reports, the evaluation committee shall deter-mine the best ranking candidate by applying the weights attributed to price versus quality as follows—

In case of QCBS, the lowest Financial Proposal (Fm) will be given a financial score (Sf) of one hun¬dred points. The financial scores (Sf) of the other Financial Proposals will be computed as indicated above. Proposals will be ranked according to their combined technical (St) and financial (Sf) scores us¬ing the weights (T = the weight given to the Technical Proposal; P = the weight given to the Financial Proposal; T + P = 1) indicated in the Specific Instructions:

S = St x T% + Sf x P%

[Section 51 (6).]

(121)	Negotiations.—It then prepares a Combined Technical and Financial Evaluation Report, rec-ommending the consultant with the highest combined technical and financial score for invitation to con-tract negotiations.

(122)	The negotiating team appointed by the Procuring Entity shall formulate the technical and fi-nancial issues to be discussed at negotiations.

(123)	The purpose of negotiations regarding technical matters shall be—

(a)	to formulate and finalise the Terms of Reference into the scope of services to be carried out under the assignment;

(b)	to agree on the methodology and work plan;

(c)	agree to mobilisation arrangements and reporting deadlines;

(d)	confirm the availability of key staff, make adjustments regarding deliverables and staff time as may be necessary:

Provided the selected firm shall not be allowed to substitute proposed key staff at the time of ne-gotiations (or at contract award) unless this is unavoidable due to delay in the selection procedure and a resulting extension of the proposal validity period.

(124)	If it turns out at negotiations that any key staff proposed is no longer available, the Procuring Entity may disqualify the consultants. However, if agreement can be reached on replacing key staff, their qualifications and experience shall be the same or better than for the key staff originally proposed.

(125)	The final TOR and the agreed methodology shall be incorporated in the “Description of Ser-vices”, which shall form part of the contract.

(126)	The purpose of negotiations regarding financial matters shall be to agree—

(a)	on general payment terms;

(b)	payments to be made in foreign and local currency;

(c)	mobilisation payments and bank guarantee structure and tenor;

(d)	taxes (especially a clarification of the consultant’s local tax liability, if any);

(e)	price adjustment formulas, if applicable, and other elements of the Special Conditions of Contract;

(f)	The Procuring Entity’s contribution of available documentation and studies, office space, and counterpart staff time and their responsibilities, shall also be discussed. However, the TOR, the terms of the contract on the basis of which the selection process was initiated and the proposal evaluated shall not be substantially altered. Unit prices, on the basis of which the fi-nancial proposal was ranked, shall not be negotiated.
(127)	On completion of negotiations, the negotiation team prepares a report to the designated au-thority of the Procuring Entity, which then proceeds to contract award, subject to BPP’s "No Objection” where necessary.

(128)	Unsuccessful Negotiations.—If negotiations are unsuccessful, the Procuring entity shall in¬vite the next best ranking candidate for negotiations and this procedure continues until the negotiation stage is successfully concluded. Once negotiations with the next candidate begin, the Procuring Entity shall not reopen negotiations with the former candidate.

[Section 52 (3).]

(129)	After successful completion of negotiations, but subject to “No Objection” by the BPP, where necessary, the Procuring Entity shall promptly proceed with the award of the contract to the successful candidate by sending it a “Notice of Acceptance”, and inviting it for contract signature. This procedure must be concluded within the period of proposal validity or the extended proposal validity. The Procur¬ing Entity shall also notify the other shortlisted candidates who passed the technical minimum mark that they were unsuccessful.

B.	Evaluation Procedure for the Quality Based Selection (QBS)

(130)	Use of the QBS.—The Procuring Entity shall apply the QBS method when—

(i)   the high degree of technical quality of an assignment is of overriding importance be-cause of its high supplementary impact on the successful outcome of the project and made the main focus of the competition;

(ii)	the scope of the assignment is difficult to determine and requires innovation; or

(iii)	different technical approaches are possible making price comparison difficult. In all these cases, the price is of secondary importance and usually negotiated with the best ranking technical candidate. Examples are the construction of a large dam or a build-ing with special architectural requirements, consultants assistance for privatisation of complex public assets (petrochemical industries, utilities), or management advice where the outcome is of critical importance for the success of public sector efficiency (major institutional reforms).

[Section 52 (1).]

(131)	Conduct of QBS.—The Procuring Entity may choose either two of the following procedures to conduct Quality Based Selections—

(a)	the RfP invites for technical proposals only and invites a financial proposal from the candidate with the best ranking technical proposal. After evaluation of the financial proposal it invites the candidate for contract negotiations; or

(b)	the RfP invites for technical and financial proposals in separate envelopes at the same time, but only opens the financial proposal of the best ranking technical candidate, which it then negotiates to conclude a contract. If negotiations are unsuccessful, the financial proposal of the next best ranking candidate is opened and negotiated, and so on till a satisfactory contract is concluded. The remaining financial proposals should be kept sealed in a safe box and re-turned unopened to the unsuccessful candidates.

[Section 52 (2).]

(139)	The RfP preparation and the evaluation and selection procedures are otherwise the same as 
C.	Evaluation Procedure for the Least Cost Selection (LCS)

(133)	Least Cost Selection (LCS).—A Procuring Entity may apply the Least-Cost Selection method for smaller (less than x25 million) assignments, or assignments of standard and routine nature with well established practices, where TOR can be easily defined, such as standard financial audits and simple engineering. The procedure is based on comparability of technical proposals and least cost. When ap-plying this method, the Procuring Entity shall issue the RfP and carry out the evaluation of technical and financial proposals as under QCBS. This method does not include weighting quality versus price. Following technical evaluation, the Procuring Entity shall retain only those firms that obtained the minimum technical score. As for QCBS, the Procuring Entity shall proceed to public opening and evaluation of the financial proposals of those candidates who scored the minimum technical score only. Following financial evaluation, the candidate with the lowest evaluated financial proposal is invited for negotiations. If agreement is not reached, the candidate whose financial proposal is ranked second low-est shall, in turn, be invited to negotiate and so on, until a satisfactory agreement is reached with next best ranked candidate.

D.	Fixed Budget Selection (FBS)

(134)	A Procuring Entity may apply the Fixed Budget Selection procedure for simple assignments where TOR and staff input can be precisely defined, and where the cost cannot exceed a fixed budget amount. The RfP shall state the fixed amount in the Specific Instructions. Candidates shall be requested to provide their best technical and financial proposals in separate envelopes, as under QCBS, with cost figures that shall not exceed the budgetary limit. For this purpose, the Procuring Entity shall prepare the TOR carefully and make a detailed internal cost estimate, to ensure that the budget is sufficient to carry out the requested assignment. The Procuring Entity shall proceed with the opening and evaluation of the technical proposals as under QCBS. At the public opening of the financial proposals of the techni¬cally qualified candidates, the financial proposals shall be read out aloud and the proposals that exceed the budgetary limit shall not be further evaluated. The Procuring Entity shall select the candidate who has submitted the highest ranked technical proposal within the budget limit for contract negotiations, award and signature subject to any necessary BPP certification.

E.	Consultants Qualifications Selection (CQS)

(135)	Consultants Qualifications Selection (CQS).—A Procuring Entity may apply the CQS method for small (less than 25 million) and unique assignments, mostly with a short duration—

(a)	when a comprehensive selection procedure is not justified;

(b)	when the time and cost of examining and evaluating a large number of proposals are dispro-portionate to the value of the services requested;

(c)	when a firm’s specialty meets the unique criteria for a particular assignment for which there are few specialist firms available; and

(d)	when it is in the interest of national defence and security.

[Section 52 (1).]

(136)	Under the CQS method, the Procuring Entity shall first prepare the TOR. Next, the Procuring Entity shall advertise to request expressions of interest. The request shall indicate the main elements of the assignment taken from the TOR and ask for information on the consultants’ qualifications, experience and proven competence in the area of the assignment. After review of the expressions of interest and informa¬tion received, the Procuring Entity shall select the most suitable candidate and request it to submit a com¬bined technical-financial proposal on the basis of a simplified RfP including detailed TOR. An evaluation
 committee of the Procuring Entity shall evaluate the technical and financial proposal, make its recommen¬dations for contract negotiations, and submit them to the designated approving authority. Once approval is obtained, the Procuring Entity shall proceed to negotiations and contract signature.

F.	Single Source Selection (Direct Contracting) - (SSS)

(137)	A Procuring Entity may with the express written approval of the BPP, request a single firm to prepare technical and financial proposals based on a simplified RfP with detailed TOR, and, following BPP certification negotiate a contract. Since direct contracting does not have the benefits of competi¬tion and comparative analysis, the Procuring Entity shall take all cautionary measures to ensure that the principles of economy, efficiency and transparency are respected.

(138)	The following circumstances may warrant single source selection—

(a)	emergency situations arising from natural disasters or a financial crisis or other sudden un-predictable events of national consequence requiring immediate expert advice However, sudden requirements for expertise that are caused by lack of or inadequate procurement planning shall not be justified as emergency situations.

(b)	small value, i.e. less than N1,000,000;

(c)	advice of a proprietary nature where a sole firm has the only expertise;

(d)	continuity of similar services, where the original contract was awarded competitively following shortlisting, e.g. for assignments of “downstream work”, such as detailed engineering after the feasibility study, or supervision of implementation after detailed engineering. However, if the initial RfP, including the selection procedure, and the contract did not provide for possible downstream work, a normal competitive selection procedure shall be followed for the down-stream activity, whereby the incumbent consulting firm may be included in the shortlist, pro-vided it completed its upstream work satisfactorily and expresses interest;

(e)	It is in the interest of national defence and security.

[Section 47 (3).]

G.	Selection of Special Types of Consultants

The following special types of consultants may be needed for particular assignments. Their use is identified during project preparation or as a result of a federal development policy programme, or pro-grammes associated with national or international development organisations or activities.

(139)	Use of Financial Institutions.—A Procuring Entity may decide to use the services of Finan¬cial Institutions (Investment Banks, Commercial Banks, Financial Management Firms, or Privatisation Consultants) for advice in the privatisation of public assets or assistance in the privatisation process itself. Selection shall be by QCBS method. Selection criteria may include experience in similar assign-ments, having a network of potential purchasers, or past results in assets sold. When the assignment is for advice only, the selection shall be based on the normal comparison of quality and cost (“retainer fee” and reimbursable expenditures). If, in addition, the assignment includes assistance in privatisation, the RfP and the selection procedure may be based on a “success fee” proposed by competing consult¬ants on the basis of their individual estimate of the likely sale value of the assets, described in the RfP. Under this alternative, if the consultant passes the minimum qualifying technical mark, the success fee may be the only price element of competition, while the fee and the reimbursable cost are fixed amounts. Pre-proposal visits to the site (with minutes signed by participants) may be required to pro¬vide sufficient information to competing consultants in order to obtain responsive proposals and to avoid ambiguities during the evaluation procedure.

(140)	Use of Procurement Agents.—For complex project activities, where the Procuring Entity lacks the necessary procurement capacity, BPP may direct that it contracts a procurement agent to han¬dle the procurement on behalf of the Procuring Entity. For the selection the Procuring Entity shall fol¬low the QCBS method. The contract shall provide that the procurement agent will be paid a fixed fee or a percentage of the contracts that will be procured. If the contract is only for procurement advice, pay¬ment terms may be a Fixed fee or on the basis of a “time-based” contract (number of staff-months) with a ceiling price. Since the work is fairly routine, the price competition may be increased in the selection criteria of the RfP by setting the proportional weight given to the cost of the assignment and the techni¬cal quality of the proposal at 50 points each.

(141)	Use of Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs).—For social type of development projects, where the knowledge of the local community is paramount for the success of the project, or in cases where the contribution of civil society is needed, Procuring Entities may decide to use non¬governmental or non-profit organisations (NGOs), Procuring Entities shall use the QCBS selection method for larger assignments, but for smaller assignments the CQS method may be applied. The nor¬mal procedures for advertising for expressions of interest and shortlisting shall be followed. The RfP should include criteria to ensure that NGOs are qualified and possess proven success rates in their field of competence (especially for social services). NGOs may be included in the shortlist if they express interest. Single-source selection may be appropriate, subject to the Procuring Entity’s internal review procedures and BPP “no-objection” if the programme activity is subject to prior review.

PART VII

Selection of Individual Consultants

(142)	When a Procuring Entity needs individual technical advice or assistance it may want to select individual consultants with the experience and qualifications necessary for a particular assignment. This type of services may include—

(a)	preparation of TOR;

(b)	updating or revision of feasibility studies;

(c)	preliminary engineering designs of smaller projects;

(d)	technical assistance in economic and sectoral planning, institutional reorganisation and man-agement;

(e)	assistance in procurement planning, preparation of bidding and proposal documents, and the evaluation of bids for goods and works and consultant proposals;

(f)	technical assistance in project management, supervision or completion reports;

(g)	training.

(143)	Procuring Entities may advertise the assignment in order to receive expressions of interest. However, they may constitute a shortlist from their available data base and approach the individuals directly by sending them the TOR. Selection shall be carried out through comparison of the qualifica¬tions of at least six suitable candidates. Regulations of the Procuring Entity for evaluation and approval of candidates shall apply. Criteria shall be academic background, experience, specific knowledge and verifiable references for successful completion relevant for the assignment. If quality of the assignment is paramount and the expertise rather rare, selection shall be done on the basis of quality only. When the expertise for an assignment is more generally available, fees may be negotiable depending on market conditions and availability of the individuals. For assignments of more than six months, an interview of the candidates must be carried out before final selection is made.

(144)	Evaluation Criteria

Procuring Entities shall apply the following technical scores, which may vary according to the type of assignment, in the selection of individual consultants, as shown in the example below—

Evaluation Criteria	Points

General Qualifications (Education)	 10

Working Experience	 15

Adequacy for the assignment

(applicability of experience)	 65

Relevant Experience	 5

Communication Skill, Compuer Skill, etc	 10

(145)	For a competitive selection of individual consultants, the Procuring Entity shall use BPP’s standard Letter of Invitation (LOI) and contract for individual consultants. If the consultants are se-lected on a competitive basis using quality only, the Procuring Entity shall contact the consultant with the highest technical score and if available negotiate the fee and other terms and conditions. If selection takes place on the basis of quality and cost comparison, the Procuring Entity shall offer the contract to the consultant with the highest combined score.

(146)	Procuring Entities may contract individual consultants directly in exceptional cases, such as—

(?)	tasks that are a continuation of previous work of the consultant, for which the consultant was selected;

(b)	assignments lasting less than six months;

(c)	emergency situations resulting from natural disasters or a financial crisis or similar events;

(d)	when there are only few or no other consultants available with the required expertise.

(147)	In such case, the Procuring Entity shall send the consultant the Loi with the TOR and condi-tions of contract, negotiate the fee, if necessary, and sign the contract.

[Section 19.]

FIRST SCHEDULE

REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF CONSULTANTS SELECTION

Review of Selection Procedure

(1)	For all selection methods subject to prior review in accordance with thresholds [specified below 	] [announced separately in BPP Procurement Notes], BPP shall fulfil the re¬view function. For this purpose, BPP shall review the selection procedures proposed by the Procuring Entity, including advertising, the Terms of Reference, the Request for Proposals, and the planning of the procure¬ment process, for conformity with the regulations and the Procurement Law. The Procuring Entity shall promptly inform BPP of any delay, or other changes in the implementation of the procurement plan regard¬ing the selection procedure, and agree with BPP on corrective measures.

(2)	Internal Procurement Review at the Procuring Entity.

(3)	The Approving Authority of a Procuring Entity is the Tenders Board by delegation of the Minis¬ter where it concerns a Ministry or by delegation of the Chairman where it concerns a Public Enterprise.

(4)	The Procurement Unit (PU) of a Ministry or a Public Enterprise prepares all procurement docu¬ments, including procurement plans, in collaboration with the project and budget units, and prepares requests for approvals and no-objections on behalf of the Tenders Board.

(5)	The Procurement Planning Committee (PCC) which is composed of representatives of various departments in a Ministry or Public Enterprise, reviews if procurement plans meet the needs and budget of the Ministry or the Public Enterprise and tenders are on schedule with the needs assessment.

(6)	Before Proposals are invited the Procuring Entity shall furnish to BPP for its comments, the Re¬quest for Expressions of Interest and the draft Terms of Reference, the proposed shortlist and draft Request for Proposals, including the evaluation criteria; and the conditions of contract, and shall make such modifica¬tions in said documents as BPP shall reasonably request. Any further modification shall require BPP’s ap¬proval before it is issued to the shortlisted candidates.

(7)	For the evaluation of proposals, the Procuring Entity shall use BPP’s Standard Proposal Evalua¬tion Report.

(8)	After proposals have been received and evaluated, the Procuring Entity shall, before a final deci¬sion on the award is made, furnish to BPP in sufficient time for its review, the technical evaluation report (prepared, if BPP shall so request, by experts acceptable to BPP), together with the recommendations for the candidates who passed the qualifying technical mark and whose financial proposals will be evaluated, The technical evaluation report to BPP shall be accompanied by the three best ranking technical proposals. The Procuring Entity shall also request BPP’s no objection, if the technical evaluation report recommends rejec¬tion of all proposals.

(9)	When BPP determines that the technical evaluation is inconsistent with the RfP and the approved procurement procedures, it shall promptly inform the Procuring Entity and state the reasons for such deter¬mination. Otherwise, BPP shall provide its no-objection and authorise the Procuring Entity to proceed with the opening and evaluation of the financial proposals, when it concerns a selection based on quality and price (QCBS, LCS, FBS), or give its “No Objection” to invite the candidate with the best ranking technical pro¬posal to submit a financial proposal (QBS), or to open and evaluate the financial proposal of the candidate with the best ranking technical proposal (QBS). The “No Objection” to the technical evaluation report will also authorise the Procuring Entity to proceed with negotiating a contract with the firm obtaining the highest combined technical and financial scores

(10)	Upon BPP’s no-objection, the Procuring Entity shall invite the selected firm for negotiations, with the intention to award the contract to the firm if negotiations are successful. If there are no or only mi¬nor changes in the draft contract issued with the RfP, the Procuring Entity and the selected candidate may negotiate the contract by facsimile, or electronic mail. After successful negotiations, the Procuring Entity and the successful firm will initial the draft contract and submit the initialed contract to BPP for “No Objection” to sign the contract.

(11)	If the Procuring Entity requires an extension of bid validity to complete the process of evalua¬tion, obtain necessary approvals and clearances and to make the award, it should seek BPP’s prior approval for the extension of the proposal validity period.

(12)	If the Procuring Entity receives protests or complaints from candidates about the evaluation, the Procuring Entity shall send a copy of the Procuring Entity’s response to BPP for information.

(13)	The terms and conditions of a contract shall not, without BPP’s prior approval, materially differ from those on which proposals were issued.

(14)	In all cases, also those not requiring prior review, the Procuring Entity will send one conformed copy of the contract to BPP promptly after its signing.

(15)	The Procuring Entity shall publicly disclose in its website, the procurement journal and the website of the BPP, the description and amount of the contract, together with the name and address of the successful candidate, and ensure that the signed contract is duly recorded and filed.

(18)	Amendments, Modifications or Extensions if an amendment to the contract, or change order, or extension would increase the original amount of the contract price by more than fifteen per cent, or if any other major modification is needed to complete the contract, prior BPP no-objection is required. BPP has the right to approve or reject such changes, and in the latter case, to propose alternative less costly modifications or recom¬mend a reduction in the scope and size of the contract. 

SECOND SCHEDULE

Types of Consulting Contracts

1.	Standard Contract Forms

Procuring Entities shall use the following Standard Contracts for Consultants Services prepared by

BPP—

(a)	lump sum contracts for complex assignments;

(b)	lump sum contracts for simple assignments;

(c)	time-based contracts for complex assignments;

(d)    time-based contracts for simple assignments;

(e)	lump sum and Time-Based Contracts for Individual Consultants.

2.	In the rare circumstances that the Standard Contract is not applicable to a specific consulting assignment, a different contract form may only be used with BPP’s prior agreement.

3.	For all contract forms, the main contract provisions are described in the General Conditions of Contract, which are standard and shall not be changed. Provisions that are specific to the assignment and any modifica¬tions to the General Conditions of Contract are detailed in the Special Conditions of Contract. Provisions of the General Conditions of Contract can only be modified through the Special Conditions of Contract. The Standard Contract, including the Special Conditions of Contract, shall always be part of the RfP.

4.	All Contracts for Consulting Services, whether standard or otherwise, shall contain provisions for the following important elements or requirements. A Preamble explaining the Procuring Entity’s need for the services and confirming the readiness and ability of the consultant to render such services—

(a)	A list of the documents constituting the Contract.

(b)	Definitions and Interpretations of the basic terms used in the Contract.

(c)	The date for commencement and the time for completion of the services.

(d)    Postponement and Termination of the Contract, upon notice by the Procuring Entity or in case of force majeure, and the ensuing rights and liabilities of each party,

(e)	Entry into force of the Contract.

(f)     Modification of the Contract.

(g)	The rights, obligations and liabilities of the parties, including circumstances of indemnifica-tion by one party to the other.

(h)	Changes in the status or organisation of the consultant during the course of the Contract.

(i)     Clarification of taxation requirements applicable to the consultant in the country where the project is located.

(j)     Identification of the insurances that must be taken out by the consultant.

(k)    Ownership of the material prepared by the consultants.

(l)      The consultant’s personnel and any counterparts of the Procuring Entity.

(m)	Assignment of the services or any part thereof to subconsultants.

(n)	Remuneration of the consultant and the method of payment.

(o)	The procedure for settlement of disputes.

(p)	The language of the Contract and the applicable law.

(q)	The addresses of the Procuring Entity and the consultant for the purpose of formal notices.



5.	Lump Sum (Fixed Price) Contract

Under Lump Sum Consultancy Services, the candidate firm includes its total remuneration (fees) on the basis of the estimated input of its personnel, along with the cost of the inputs (reimbursables) to carry out the services. The services are paid on the basis of the agreed payment schedule in accordance with set mile¬stones (deliverables) of the progress of the services, usually associated with reports. Lump sum contracts are used mainly for assignments in which the content and the duration of the services and the required output of the consultants are clearly defined. They are therefore easy to administer. As a general rule, contracts for assignments that provide for the production of regular reports are lump-sum based. Feasibility studies, design and detailed engineering services or standard accounting services are also contracted on a lump sum basis. The contract includes the agreed breakdown of the cost components. If the lump-sum contract is subject to price adjustment, the financial forms of the RfP should include the table asking for the detailed breakdown of the remuneration of the consultant, which shall be used to calculate the increase in the remuneration accord¬ing to an agreed price adjustment formular which takes into consideration inflation rates local/international price adjustment formular should be included in all contracts with a duration of over eighteen months.

6.	Time-Based Contract

Time-based contracts are used when the scope and length of services are difficult to determine, either be¬cause the services are linked to activities of other parties in the project or because the inputs by the consultants to reach the objectives are spread over time. As a consequence, even though the contract may provide for periodic reports, the time spent is subject to variables that cannot be precisely estimated for the whole assignment. There¬fore, the actual time spent becomes the main measurable cost element of the assignment. Payment is based on the agreed time-based rates for the consultant’s staff as detailed in the relevant remuneration schedule of the contract, complemented by the agreed reimbursable items.

7.	The time-based rates concern the staff month rates including all salaries, social benefits, costs, overheads and profits. The reimbursable costs are separate and will be paid according to unit rates and/or actuals, con¬sultants are required to keep time-sheets of the actual time spent and submit their invoices on that basis, which may be audited accordingly. The contact price agreed is included in the contract as the “ceiling amount” of the total payments to be made to the consultants. Usually, the contract requires the consultant to advise the Procuring Entity when it reaches eighty per cent of the ceiling price. This permits the Procuring Entity to make a judgment if the contract can be completed as envisaged, or if the scope of the assignment needs to be reduced to stay within the budget, or if an increase in the costs needs to be negotiated. The ceil¬ing amount should include an allowance for contingencies to cover unforeseen work and expenses and a pro¬vision for price adjustment where appropriate.

8.	Time based contracts are mostly suited for supervision services of works, lengthy studies with multiple components and inputs, longer term technical assistance or training, and management contracts.

THIRD SCHEDULE

Information for Consultants on the content of the Request for Proposals

Standard Request for Proposals (RfP)

The RfP is a standard document issued by the BPP, which covers the majority of consulting assign¬ments. It includes the standard “Instructions to Consultants” (ITC) and the “Specific Instructions”, which consists of line-item modifications to the standard clauses to adapt the ITC to the specific requirements of the assignment. If under exceptional circumstances, the Procuring Entity needs to amend the standard ITC, it shall do so through the Specific Instructions attached to the ITC and not by amending the main text.

Standard Contracts

The standard contracts (see Annex 2) issued by the BPP consist of the General Conditions of Con¬tract, which are not changed, and the Special Conditions of Contract, which consist also of line-item modifi¬cations of the standard section to specify the agreements reached during contract negotiations regarding the consulting assignment, including advances, payment arrangements, tax liabilities and reporting schedules.

FOURTH SCHEDULE

Information to Consultants on the Selection Procedure

This Annex provides information to consultants, both firms and individuals, interested in participat¬ing in the procurement of consulting contracts.

Procuring Entity’s Role

The Procuring Entity is responsible for the selection and employment of consultants. It invites, re-ceives, and evaluates proposals and awards the contract. The standard Request for Proposals (RfP) and the terms and conditions of the standard contract between the Procuring Entity and the consultant define the rights and obligations of each contracting party.

The Procuring Entity reviews the procurement procedures, documents, Tender evaluations, award recommendations and the contract to ensure that the process is carried out in accordance with agreed proce¬dures and administers the contract during execution.

Role of the Bureau of Public Procurement (BPP)

The Council sets thresholds for the prior review of public procurement launched by Procuring Enti¬ties, and for contracts subject to “prior review” the BPP reviews the documents for their correctness, before- the Procuring Entity issues them, and issues “Certificates of no-objection for contract award”

If at any time in the procurement process, the BPP concludes that the agreed procedures were not fol¬lowed in any material respect, or if the “no objection” was issued on the basis of incomplete, inaccurate or misleading information, the BPP may declare mis-procurement.

The BPP has the power to blacklist/debar any supplier, contractor, or service provider that contra¬venes the Procurement Act or the Regulations made pursuant to this Act, and to maintain a list of firms and, persons that have been blacklisted/debarred from participating in public procurement, and to publish this list in the Procurement Journal.

If the BPP determines the engagement in corrupt or fraudulent practices by representatives of the Procuring Entity or of the Tenderer, the BPP may impose or cause to be imposed the applicable sanctions in the Procurement Act.

The BPP publishes the details of major contracts in the Procurement Journal and on its website.

The BPP publishes Standard Proposal Documents (SPDs) for various types of consultant selection. The regulations require that the Procuring Entities use these documents, with minimum changes as necessary to deal with project-specific aspects.

[Section 5 and 6.]

Information on the Selection of Consultants

Invitation on opportunities for consulting assignments may be obtained from the BPP Procurement Jour¬nal, its website or the websites of the Procuring Entities. In addition, advertisements for expressions of interest are placed in leading national newspapers and widely used international newspapers for international shortlists.

Consultants9 Role

When consultants receive the RfP, and they decide that they can meet the requirements of the TOR, as well as the commercial and contractual conditions, they should make the arrangements necessary to pre¬pare a responsive proposal (for example, visiting the country of the assignment, seeking associations, collect¬ing documentation, setting up the preparation team).

If the consultants find in the RfP documents, especially in the selection procedure and evaluation cri¬teria any ambiguity, omission or internal contradiction, or any feature that is unclear or that appears dis¬criminatory or restrictive, they should seek clarification from the Procuring Entity, in writing, within the period specified in the RfP. Consultants should ensure that they submit a fully responsive proposal including all the supporting documents requested in the RfP. It is essential to ensure accuracy in the curricula vitae of key staff submitted with the proposals. The curricula vitae should be signed by the individuals and dated and signed by the proposing firms. Noncompliance with important requirements may result in rejection of the proposal. Once the technical and financial proposals are received and opened, consultants shall not be re¬quired nor permitted to change the substance and the key staff or to change the quoted fee. Minor modifica¬tions may be made at the stage of negotiations in accordance with the provisions of the RfP.

Confidentiality

The procedure of proposal evaluation shall be confidential until the contract award is notified to the successful firm. Confidentiality enables the Procuring Entity and BPP to avoid improper interference, or the perception of it. If, during the evaluation procedure, consultants wish to bring information to the notice of the Procuring Entity, BPP, or both, they should do so in writing in accordance with the provision’s of the RfP.

Complaints

The Procuring Entity is responsible for the selection and award procedure and candidates should ad¬dress themselves to the Procuring Entity for any queries, issues and possible complaints. In the case of a complaint regarding a specific selection procedure, such complaint should first be introduced in writing to the Procuring Entity in accordance with these Regulations.

Information on Contract Award

Information on contract award will be published in the procurement journal and on the websites of the Procuring Entities concerned and the website of the BPP. If after notification of award, a consultant wishes to ascertain the grounds on which its Proposal was not selected, it should address its request to the Procuring Entity. If a discussion is arranged, only the Proposal of the consultant can be discussed and not the Proposals of other consultants who participated in the selection.

FIFTH SCHEDULE

[Section 40.]

Procurement Filing

1. The experience is that lack of an efficient filing system causes long and costly delays in the search for documents at critical moments when procurement, Independent Post Reviews are needed by BPP, or pro¬curement audits are required by the Auditor-General. BPP will issue regulations separately on maintaining elements of records of procurement proceedings—

•	Description of the goods, works or consulting service, requested, usually in the invitation to ten¬der (for goods and works) or the request for proposals for consulting services).

•	Document prescribing the selection of the tender method or consultant selection method and the reason for this.

•	Lists of tenderers who submitted tenders or proposals, with names and addresses, usually obtained from the registration of tender or proposal submissions and from the minutes of opening of ten¬ders and proposals.

•	Minutes of tender and proposal opening, with recording of prices, tender and proposal evaluation reports.

•	List and summary of clarifications asked during pre-qualification, tender/proposal submission and evaluation (per tender and per proposal).

•	Records of formal rejection of tenders or proposals and the grounds thereof,

•	Records of procurement proceedings involving other than open competitive tendering, which did not result in a procurement contract and a statement on the likely reasons.

•	Document by which it was decided to proceed with direct contracting and the reason for this.

•	Document whereby it was decided to proceed to limited tendering and to grant a margin of prefer¬ence and the grounds for this.

•	Record of any complaints received from candidates and the responses sent.

(a)	in response to a natural disaster;

(b)	in the case of national security, if so justified by the BPP;

(c)	when equipment is proprietary in character and is obtainable only from one supplier;

(g)	when, after the goods originally envisaged for the project have been procured through ICB, an additional quantity of the same goods is urgently needed to meet the requirements of the project, and when the BPP can be satisfied that there is no advantage to obtaining these items through NCB or ICB; and

(h)	when the civil works to be undertaken are a natural extension of an earlier or ongoing job, for which the corresponding contract had been awarded following NCB or ICB satisfactory to the BPP, and when it can be shown to the satisfaction of the BPP that the engagement of the same contractor will be more economical than normal bidding, and will ensure compati¬bility of results in terms of quality of work.

[Section 42.]

63.	Direct Labour Account

Direct Labour Account means the procurement of civil works by a Procuring Entity using its own personnel, equipment and resources under its control for the execution of the works in question. This method may be employed in exceptional circumstances—

(a)	when the size, nature and location of the works are such that qualified contractors are unlikely to bid;

(b)	when the quantities of work cannot be defined in advance;

(c)	when ongoing works are interrupted due to breach of contract or contractor failure and need to be continued to avoid serious damage;

(d)	when the procurement would be carried out by the engineering services; or

(e)	when there are emergencies requiring immediate attention.

64.

In all cases of procurements to be carried out on a Direct Labour Account, the Procuring Entity in-volved shall ensure to the satisfaction of the BPP that—

(a)	personnel deployed to execute such civil works possess the requisite technical certification, professional experience, and managerial ability;

(b)	the equipment and resources to be deployed towards the execution or the procurement are such as are technically appropriate, numerically sufficient to assure the execution of the pro-curement;

(c)	The combination of (a) and (b) above shall in every case assure that the procurement is exe-cuted expeditiously, efficiently, and at reasonable costs.

65.	Emergency Procedures

Following occurrence of natural disasters such as droughts, floods, pandemics, civil disturbances, insurrections, war or such times that government declares that an emergency situation has arisen, Pro-curing Entities may for causes directly related to the alleviation or remediation of the aforementioned circumstances carry out direct contracting of goods, works and related services in accordance with the emergency procurement guidelines formulated by the BPP. In such circumstance, every Procuring En¬tity shall apply principles of sound procurement, economy, efficiency, transparency and accountability.

[Section 43.]

66.

At the end of the emergency situation, Procuring Entities that have applied emergency procurements shall prepare a report to BPP for its approval on the procurements so carried out. Subsequent procure-ments shall apply the regulations without exception.

67.	Use of Procurement Agents and Management Contractors

Where a Procuring Entity lacks the necessary organisation, resources, and experience, it may employ (or be required by BPP to employ) as its agent, a firm specialising in handling procurement. The agent shall strictly follow all the procurement procedures outlined in the contract on behalf of the Procuring En-tity, including the use of BPP Standard Bid Documents, review procedures and documentation.

68.	Inspection Agents

Management Contractors may be employed in a similar manner for a fee to contract for miscellane-ous works involving reconstruction, repairs, rehabilitation, and new constructions in emergency situa¬tions, or where large numbers of small contracts are involved. BPP’s Guidelines for the Use of Consult¬ants shall be used to acquire the services of the Procurement Agent or a Management Contractor on a competitive basis.

69.	Procurement under BOT and Similar Private Sector Arrangements

If a Procuring Entity participating in financing the cost of a project procured under a BOO, BOT, BOOT or similar type of contract, either of the following procurement procedures shall be used, as set forth in detail in the Financing Agreement with the private entrepreneur—

(a)	The entrepreneur under the BOO, BOT, BOOT or similar type of contract shall be selected under ICB or RT procedures acceptable to BPP, which may include several stages in order to arrive at the optimal combination of evaluation criteria, such as the cost and magnitude of the financing offered, the performance specifications of the facilities offered, the cost charged to the user or purchaser, other income generated for the Procuring Entity or purchaser by the facility, and the period of the facility’s depreciation. The said entrepreneur selected in this manner shall then be free to procure the goods, works and services required for the facility from eligible sources, using its own procedures. In this case, the Financing Agreement shall specify the type of expenditures incurred by the said entrepreneur towards which the financ-ing of the Procuring Entity will apply; or

(b)	If the said entrepreneur has not been selected in the manner set forth in sub-paragraph (a) above, the goods, works or services required for the facility and to be financed by the Procur-ing Entity shall be procured in accordance with open ICB or RT procedures.

70. Participation in the above arrangements shall proceed in accordance with BPP Guidelines.

II.	PROCEDURES FOR BID PREPARATION, SUBMISSION, OPENING, EVALUATION

AND AWARD OF CONTRACT

In the event of pre-qualifications, bid documents shall only be issued to prequalified Bidders. Unless otherwise agreed by the BPP, only Standard Bid and Contract documents issued by the BPP shall be used.

[Section 23 (2), (4) and (5).]

72. After the advertisement/commencement of a bid proceeding, Procuring Entities may not communi-cate with prospective Bidders in any manner other than as provided for under the Act or these Regula-tions.

74.	Pre-bid meetings

Any additional information, clarification, correction of errors or modifications of the bid document provided to any prospective Bidders shall be simultaneously sent to each purchaser of the original bid document. Such information, clarification, correction of errors or modifications shall be provided or made in time sufficient before the bid submission deadline to enable Bidders to take appropriate action.

75.

If necessary, the Procuring Entity may extend the submission deadline. Procuring Entities shall pro-vide reasonable access to project sites for visits by prospective Bidders.

76.	Bid modification or withdrawal

A Bidder may modify or withdraw its bid prior to the submission deadline in accordance with the provisions in the bid solicitation.

[Section 29 (4).]

77.	Validity of Bids

Bids shall remain valid for the period specified in the bid solicitation. Such period must be sufficient to enable a Procuring Entity to complete the evaluation and comparison of bids and to obtain all neces-sary approvals, including the no-objection of the BPP such that a contract award may be made within the validity period.

[Section 29 (1).]

78.	Extension of Validity of Bids

If an extension of bid validity becomes necessary due to unforeseen difficulties in the bid evaluation and award process, the Procuring Entity shall subject to the approval of the BPP, request the Bidder to extend the validity of its bid for such period as would be the minimum required to complete the evalua-tion, obtain the necessary approvals and award the contract.

[Section 29 (2) and (3).]

79.

In the case of fixed price contracts, requests for second and subsequent extensions will be permissi¬ble only if the request for extension provides for an appropriate adjustment mechanism of the quoted price to reflect changes in the cost of inputs for the contract over the period of the extension.

80. Whenever an extension of the bid validity period is requested, a Bidder shall not be asked or be permitted to change the quoted (base) price or other conditions of its bid. A Bidder shall have the right to refuse to grant such an extension without forfeiting its bid security, but a Bidder willing to extend the validity of its bid shall be required to provide a suitable extension of its bid security.

81.	Bid Security.

Procuring Entities may require Bidders to provide bid security to secure the validity of the bid within the period specified in the bid documents. The bid security shall be in the amount indicated in the bid documents, as specified by the BPP.

[Section 26 (1), (2) and (3).]

82. The format of the bid security shall be in accordance with the form included in the bid documents and Bidders may enquire from the Procuring Entity in advance if a particular issuing entity of a security is acceptable. If an issuing entity is foreign but the security is otherwise in conformity with the re-quirements in the bid document, the Procuring Entity shall not reject the security.

83. To ensure confidentiality of the bid price, bid securities should be set in amounts for all Bidders, in relation to the size of the contract, provided the amount is no more than two per cent of the bid price.

84. The bid security shall remain valid for a period of four weeks beyond the validity period of the bids, in order to provide reasonable time for the Procuring Entity to act if the security is to be called or till the performance security of the successful Bidder is obtained at contract award. The Procuring Entity shall return the bid securities to the unsuccessful Bidders once it has signed the contract with the suc¬cessful Bidder and obtained its performance security.

85.	Validity and Return of the Bid Security

The Procuring Entity will call the bid security—

(a)	when a Bidder withdraws or modifies its bid after bid submission;

(b)	if a Bidder fails to sign the contract or comply with any other condition of contract signature; and

[Sections 20 (b) and 21.]

89.	Opening Date of the Bids

The date, hour and place for the receipt of bids and for the, bid opening shall be announced in the invitation to tender. The time for bid opening shall be the same as for the deadline for the receipt of bids or, if bids are received in a location different from the place of bid opening, promptly thereafter, allowing just sufficient time to take the bids to the place announced for, bid opening.

[Section 30 (a) (b), (c) and (d).]

90.	Public Opening

Bids shall be opened in public and Bidders or their representatives shall be allowed to be present and verify that the bids have not been tampered with. Bids received after this time shall be returned unopened. The name of the Bidders and total amount of each bid and of any alternative bids if they have been re¬quested or permitted shall be read aloud and recorded in the Minutes of Bid Opening. Bidders or their rep¬resentatives present shall sign the Register for Bid Opening. In addition, all bids, particularly the summary and mutually agreed vital pages are to be counter-signed by competing Bidders or their representatives and the Secretary of the Tenders Board of the Procuring Entity.

After the closure of the bid opening session, the Procuring Entity shall ensure the safe-keeping of the bid documents.

EXAMINATION AND COMPARISON OF BILLS

91.	Confidentiality of Procedures

No information relating to the examination, clarification and evaluation of bids and recommendations concerning awards shall be communicated to any person not officially concerned with these procedures until the award of a contract to the successful Bidder is announced.

92.	Use of Standard Evaluation Form

The Procuring Entity shall use, or ensure the use of, the BPP Standard Bid Evaluation Report for the Evaluation of Goods and Works to detail the specific reasons on which the determination for the re-commendation for the award of contract is made. If the procurement is subject to prior review by BPP, the Procuring Entity shall send this Report to BPP with the Procuring Entity’s contract award recommendation for BPP’s comments and “no-objection” before the award of contract to the successful Bidder is an¬nounced. The Report to BPP on the evaluation and comparison of bids shall be accompanied by the three lowest evaluated cost bids. If the procurement is subject to post review, the evaluation report and award recommendation as approved by the designated authority of the Procuring Entity.

93.	Evaluation Procedure

The Procuring Entity shall carry out the bid evaluation in two phases—

(a)	a Preliminary examination, and

(b)	detailed evaluation and comparison of bids, in accordance with the evaluation criteria stipu-lated in the bid document, in order to select the lowest responsive cost bid. 

94.	Preliminary examination

The Procuring Entity shall carry the preliminary examination to verify if the bids are substantially responsive to the bid document i.e. whether the bid—

(a)	has been properly signed and changes initialled;

(b)	is accompanied by a valid bid security, if required;

(c)	meets the laid down eligibility requirements;

(d)	is complete;

(e)       quote prices for all items in the lot or package as stipulated in the bid document;

(f)        contains computational errors; and (g)       is generally in order.

[Section 31 (1) (a) to (d).]

95. If a bid does not substantially conform to the specifications, or contains inadmissible reservations or is not otherwise substantially responsive to the bid document, it shall not be considered further and shall be mentioned as “rejected” in the Evaluation Report. However, a bid should not be rejected on minor procedural grounds, which can be rectified through the clarification process.

96.	Clarification or Alteration of Bids during Evaluation

If a Procuring Entity deems it necessary to seek clarifications from a Bidder after bid opening, the Bidder shall not be permitted or requested to alter their bids, or to change the substance or price of the bids.

[Section 31 (2).]

97.	Arithmetical Errors

The bid price read out at bid opening shall be adjusted for any arithmetical errors, and adjustments shall be made for any quantifiable nonmaterial deviations or reservations. Price adjustment provisions applying to the period of implementation of the contract shall not be taken into account in the evalua-tion. The Procuring Entity shall notify the Bidders of arithmetical errors made. If the Bidder does not agree with this notification, its bid shall be rejected.

[Section 31 (4) and (5).]

98.	Currency Conversion

When bid prices are expressed in foreign currency or several currencies, the price of the bids shall be converted into naira at the medium exchange rate of the Central Bank of Nigeria prevailing at the date stated in the bid document.

[Section 32 (6).]

99.	Transportation and Insurance

For the supply of imported goods, the evaluation and comparison of bids shall be on the basis of CIP or CIF price. For goods manufactured in Nigeria, Ex Works prices are evaluated and compared. If bids are on the basis of CIP (Place of Destination), the cost of inland transportation and insurance to the place of destination shall be added to the price of domestically produced goods.

[Section 32 (5).]

100.	Works and Turnkey Contracts

Under works and turnkey contracts, contractors shall be responsible for all duties, taxes and other lev¬ies. Bidders shall take these factors into account in preparing their bids. The evaluation and comparison of such bids shall be on this basis. Bid evaluation for works shall be strictly in monetary terms. If time is a critical factor, the value of early completion to the Procuring Entity may be taken into account ac¬cording to criteria presented in the bid document, but only if the conditions of contract also provide for commensurate penalties for noncompliance.

101.	Deviations.

The Procuring Entity shall notify Bidders of major, deviations and the resulting rejection of their bids. Deviations may be clarified by Bidders but not withdrawn.

[Section 31 (5).]

102.	Major Deviations

Major deviations for Goods are—

(a)	incompatibility with the technical specifications;

(b)	unacceptable commercial terms; and

(c)	proposed performance criteria, which do not meet those specified in the bid documents.

103.

Major deviations for works are—

(a)	unacceptable subcontracting contrary to the terms in the bid document;

(b)	unacceptable time-phasing in construction;

(c)	unacceptable alternative design if alternative design is permitted or proposing an alternative design when none is permitted and the bid does not respond to the requested design;

(d)	proposing a bid subject to price adjustment when the bid documents call for fixed price; and

(e)	in the case of pre-qualification, a bid from a Bidder who was not pre-qualified.

104.

Minor Deviations include—

(a)	slightly different delivery times;

(b)	slightly different payment terms;

(c)	minor attachments on equipment clarifications have been omitted from the bid;

(d)       minor differences in the performance criteria but not affecting the efficiency of an equipment or a utility;

(e)	any deviation that does not have a major impact on the cost of the bid.

105.	Alternative Bids

If the bid document asks for alternative bids or designs, the Bidders shall first quote the price for the base method and specifications indicated in the bid document and secondly indicate the price for the deviation or alternative solution. Only the alternative bid of the substantially responsive lowest evalu¬ated bid shall be considered for contract award.

106.	Domestic Preference

In the case of ICB, when comparing bids from foreign contractors or suppliers with national Bid¬ders, Procuring Entities may grant a margin of preference to domestic contractors, and suppliers for goods manufactured in Nigeria. The BPP will from time to time set the margins of preference to be granted. Bid documents may provide a domestic preference of fifteen of the delivered price for goods and seven and a half per cent for works. The procedure for evaluating margins of preference is ex¬plained in Annex 2. Domestic preference is only applicable if provided for in the bid document.

[Section 34.]

107.	Post qualification

At the time of contract award, in the event of pre-qualification, the Procuring Entity shall verify that the information provided in the pre-qualification application of the selected Bidders is still valid. Simi-larly, such post qualification will be applied with reference to the information provided by selected Bidders in a bid procedure without pre-qualification. In both cases, the Procuring Entity may deny the award to a Bidder who is judged no longer to have the capability or resources to perform the contract successfully and award the contract to the next lowest evaluated responsive Bidder.

108.	Rejection of Bids

Before the acceptance of a bid, the Procuring Entity may reject the bids, or cancel the procurement proceedings, without incurring any liability towards the Bidders.

[Section 28.]

109.	Reduction in scope and size to lower price

Alternatively, the Procuring Entity may consider a reduction in the scope and size of the contract, which may reduce the contract price. Following no objection from BPP, the Procuring Entity may then negotiate with the lowest evaluated Bidders to try to obtain a satisfactory contract on the basis of the revised terms and conditions.

110.	Rejection of all bids

The rejection of all Bidders requires the prior approval of BPP.

111.	Only one bid received

If following competitive bidding only one bid has been received and the bid is of good quality, meets the requirements of the bid document, is technically and financially responsive compared to mar¬ket prices, and otherwise in order, the bid can be accepted and, following evaluation, awarded to the sole Bidder.

112.	Award of Contract

The Procuring Entity shall proceed with the award of contract within the period of the bid validity, with the Bidder who meets the appropriate standards of technical capability and financial resources and whose bid has been determined to be substantially responsive to the bid documents and to offer the technically acceptable lowest evaluated cost. Such Bidder shall not be required, as a condition of award, to undertake responsibilities or work not stipulated in the specifications or to modify its bid as origi¬nally submitted.

[Sections 16 (17) and 33 (1).]

113.	Notification of award and contract signature

Where the contract is within the approving authority of the Procuring Entity, the Tender Board shall promptly notify the successful Bidder that it has been awarded the contract and invite it to execute the contract agreement, within the time period of the validity of the bids. The terms and conditions of the contract shall not materially differ from those which were included in the bid document and on the ba¬sis of which the bids were invited.

[Section 33 (3).]

114. In the case of ICB contracts, if there are no or only minor changes in the draft contract, the Procur¬ing Entity and the selected Bidder may finalise the contract by facsimile or electronic mail.

115. The Procuring Entity shall furnish to BPP a copy of the signed contract. If the procurement is sub¬ject to Prior Review by BPP, notification and award are subject to BPP’s prior approval. If the approv¬ing authority is Federal Executive Council based on BPP’s no objection, the Procuring Entity, the Pro¬curing Entity’s notification is only to inform the Bidder and it shall be formally notified when the final approval has been obtained. In any event, notification shall be given within the bid validity period.

116.	BPP certification of contract award

If the procurement is subject to prior review and BPP determines that the proposed award is not consistent with the terms of the bid document or is otherwise inconsistent with approved procurement procedures, it will promptly inform the Procuring Entity stating the reasons for its decision, and the bid shall not receive BPP’s certification for contract award.

117.	Performance Security precondition of contract award.

Security for the guarantee of performance by the Bidders shall be provided by the selected Bidders prior to contract signature. The amount of the security will not be less than five per cent or more than ten per cent of the contract value. However, the bid and contract documents shall require that if through change orders or for other reasons the value of the contract price exceeds the amount of the original contract price by a certain percentage (determined by the BPP), the security wilt be increased by a pro-portional amount (also determined by the BPP), The performance security shall be discharged after completion of the contract and expiration of the warranty period, if there is no default.

[Section 6.]

(j)        Delivery time or Schedule of completion; and

(k)	Necessary appendices, including forms for pro forma Bid bonds, Performance Guarantee and

Advance Payment Guarantee.

121.	Purchase of SBDs

If a fee is charged for the bid documents, it shall be reasonable and reflect only the cost of their printing and delivery to prospective Bidders.

[Section 27 (6).]

122.	Language

Bid documents for ICB shall be prepared only in the English language.

[Section 27 (3).]

123.	Clarity of Bid Documents

Bid documents and specifications shall be worded in such a manner so as to permit and encourage competitive bids, and shall set forth, as clearly and precisely as possible, the work to be accomplished, the goods, works and related services to be supplied, the place of delivery or installation, warranty and maintenance requirements, and any other pertinent terms and conditions such as the provision of do-mestic preference, if any.

124.

The bid documents, where appropriate, shall define the tests, standards and methods that will be utilised to judge conformity with the original equipment specifications, quality of works and delivery time. Drawings shall be consistent with the text of the technical specifications and, where appropriate, an order of preference between the two shall be specified.

125.	Essential Bid Information

All prospective Bidders shall be provided the same information, and shall be assured of equal op-portunities to obtain additional information on a timely basis. The documents shall clearly spell out—

(a)	all factors, including price, which will be taken into account in evaluating and comparing bids;

(b)	how the evaluation criteria will be quantified or otherwise evaluated (methods, terms and conditions of bid evaluation); and

(c)	if alternative bids, based on alternative designs, materials, completion schedules, payment terms, are permitted. In this case, the bid documents shall clearly state the conditions for their acceptability and the method of their evaluation, and require that goods, equipment and works meeting generally accepted business standards shall be of equal or higher equivalence.

126.	Specifications

Technical specifications and standards quoted in bid documents shall promote the broadest possible competition, while assuring the critical performance or other requirements for the goods, works and related services under procurement. As far as possible, the Procuring Entity shall specify generally ac-cepted standards such as those issued by National and International Standards Organisations with which the equipment or materials or workmanship shall comply.

127.	Specifications for Equipment and Use of Brand Names

Specifications shall be based on relevant characteristics, performances, capabilities, and qualities, and shall not prescribe brand names, catalogue numbers, or products of a specific manufacturer. If it is 

necessary to quote a brand name or catalogue number of a particular manufacturer to clarify an other-wise incomplete specification, the words “or equivalent” shall be added after such reference, except in very special cases when specific spare parts are required where a degree of standardisation is necessary to maintain certain essential features. In such cases, and where appropriate, the specifications shall permit acceptance of alternative goods which have similar characteristics and provide performance and quality at least equal to those specified. In all cases where brand names are deemed justified to be pro¬cured, prior approval of the BPP must be obtained.

128.	Validity of Bids

Bidders shall be required to submit bids valid for the period specified in the bid documents. Such period must be sufficient to enable a Procuring Entity complete the evaluation and comparison of bids, obtain all necessary approvals including the no-objection of the BPP and contract signature.

[Section 29 (1).]

129.

In any case, bid validity should not be for less than sixty days or more than one hundred and eighty days in the first instance.

130.	Currency of Bids

Prices for bids under NCB shall be quoted in naira.

131.

Prices for bids under ICB shall be expressed in widely used international currencies, as stated in the bid document. However, the portion of the bid price representing local costs shall be expressed in naira.

[Section 16 (27).]

132.

In the case of ICB, the bid solicitation document shall state the date for conversion to naira, which should be the date of bid submission/opening. The source for the conversion rate shall be the medium selling rate of the Central Bank of Nigeria. Contract payments sequel to a contract award shall be made in the currency or currencies in which the price is expressed in the successful bid.

133.	Pricing for international bids

For goods, the Procuring Entity shall invite bids under ICB on the basis of CIF (port of destination) or CIP (place of destination) for all goods offered from and manufactured abroad, including those pre-viously imported, and Ex Works, Ex-factory or off-the-shelf for goods manufactured in Nigeria. Bid¬ders may arrange for ocean and other transportation and related insurance from any eligible source in accordance with national eligibility requirements.

Where installation, commissioning or other similar services are required to be performed by the Bidders, as in the case of “supply and installation” contracts, the Bidders shall be required to quote ad-ditionally for these services.

134.

For works, ICB contracts shall be priced to include all duties, taxes and other levies.

135.	Pricing for Civil Works

Bidders for civil works contracts shall be required to quote unit prices or lump sum prices for the performance of the works, and such prices shall include all duties, taxes, and other levies for all pro-curement methods.

136.	Turnkey Contracts

In the case of Turnkey Contracts, the Bidders shall be required to quote the price of the installed plant at site, including all costs for supply of equipment, marine and local transportation and insurance, installation, and commissioning, as well as associated works and all other services included in the scope of contract such as design, maintenance, operation. Unless otherwise specified in the bid documents, the turnkey price shall include all duties, taxes, and other levies.

137.	Price

Bid documents shall state either that—

(i)        bid prices will be fixed; or

(ii)	that price adjustments will be made to reflect any changes in major cost components of the contract, such as labour, equipment, materials, and fuel.

138.	Adjustment Transportation and Insurance.

The bid documents shall state precisely the types and terms of insurance to be provided by the Bidders and shall indicate the kinds of risks to be insured against, the liabilities to be covered, and the duration of the insurance.

139.

For goods, the indemnity payable under transportation insurance shall be at least one hundred and ten per cent of the contract amount in the currency of the contract, to enable prompt replacement of lost or damaged goods.

140.

For works, a Contractor’s All Risk form of policy shall be specified. The type and extent of insur¬ance to be taken out is to be fully covered in the Contract.

141.	Alternative Bids

If alternative bids are allowed, the Bid Documents shall state clearly how such bids shall be submit-ted, prices shall be offered and how they shall be evaluated.

Main Aspects of the Contract Documents

142.	Conditions of Contract

The contract documents shall clearly define the scope of work to be performed, the goods to be sup-plied, the rights and obligations of the Procuring Entity, the Supplier or the Contractor, and the functions and authority of the Engineer, Architect or Construction Manager, if one is employed by the Procuring En¬tity in the supervision and administration of the contract, including payments and advances to be made, if any. In addition to the General Conditions of Contract, Special Conditions shall specify the types of goods and works to be procured and the location of the project site where they should be delivered. The conditions of contract shall provide a balanced allocation of risks and liabilities.

143.	Performance security

Bid documents for goods and works shall require a performance security in the form of a guarantee from a bank or a performance bond from an insurance company acceptable to the Procuring Entity, in accordance with the form included in the bid documents, and in an amount sufficient to protect the Pro-curing Entity against unsatisfactory quality of the goods, non-performance of the goods contract or the equipment installed, or non-completion of the works.

[Section 36.] 

144.

For Works, a portion of the security shall extend beyond the date of completion to cover the defects liability or maintenance period up to final acceptance by the Procuring Entity.

145.

In contracts for Goods, guarantees to protect the Procuring Entity against non-performance of the contract are required only when this is normal commercial practice under the market conditions for the goods in question.

146.

In supply and installation contracts, the performance security extends until acceptance of installed plant and is usually replaced by a warranty for the warranty period.

147.	Terms and Methods of Payment

Payment terms shall be in accordance with the national law and the commercial practices applicable to the specific goods and works to be supplied, and in accordance with the contract. Payments under the contract shall be made in the currency stipulated in the Contract.

[Section 37 (1) to (4).]

148. Payments for Works are made on the basis of progress made and shall be certified by the supervis¬ing authority.

149. Contracts for the supply of goods shall provide for the payment on the delivery and inspection, if so required, of the contracted goods except for contracts involving installation and commissioning, in which case a portion of the payment may be made after the supplier has complied with all its obliga¬tions under the contract.

150.	Mobilisation Fees

Contracts for works may provide for mobilisation fees and advances to the contractor. If so agreed, the contract documents shall—

specify any advances that may be made for supply of equipment and machinery, mobilisation expenditures, or shipment of materials on site in percentages of the contract price,

require that such advance payments shall be covered by an unconditional and irrevocable bank guarantee issued by a bank acceptable to the Procuring Entity or an insurance bond is¬sued by an Institution acceptable to the Procuring Entity, and

specify the modalities and the terms and conditions under which the guarantee will be recov¬ered and released.

[Section 35 (1) and (2).]

151. Advance payments made upon signature of the contract for mobilization and expenses should be reasonable and not exceed fifteen per cent of the contract price for domestic contractors and, ten per cent for foreign contractors. 

152.	Change Orders

During the execution of a contract, changes may occur in the quantity of work done requiring amendments to the contract agreement between the Procuring Entity and the contractor. Such amend-ments are executed by a change order or variation order, provisions for which are made in the Special Conditions of Contract, and are justified in the reports on the contract execution. The Procuring Entity shall seek BPP’s no-objection prior to the proposed amendment, if the contract is above the prior re¬view threshold or the tenders board when the contract is below the prior review threshold.

153.	Retention Fees

If retention fee is required by the Procuring Entity it should not exceed ten per cent of the contract price.

154.	Use of both a performance security and retention money

If the contract provides for both a performance security and retention fee, the total amount of both performance security and retention money should not exceed ten per cent of the contract sum.

155.	Interest on delayed payments

Procuring Entities should endeavour to make payments promptly and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract. Any payment due for more than sixty days following submission and verification of an invoice shall be deemed a delayed payment. The contract document shall state the period of sixty days for delayed payments and specify the rate at which interest (being penalties for late payments) will be paid.

[Section 37 (1) and (4).]

156.	Indemnification Requirements

Contracts shall clearly state that the proceeds of any claim arising from performance guarantees, ad-vance payment guarantees and any insurance policies entered into by the contractor under the terms of the contract, shall be payable to the Procuring Entity.

157.	Liquidated Damages and Bonus Clauses

Contracts shall provide for liquidated damages or similar clauses in an appropriate amount to cover the cost of delays in the delivery of goods or failure to meet performance requirements, or non-completion of the works, which result in loss of revenues or other benefits to the Procuring Entity.

158.	Force Majeure

The Conditions of Contract shall stipulate that failure on the part of the parties to perform their obli-gations under the contract will not be considered a default if such failure is due to force majeure as de-fined in the contract.

159.	Applicable Law and Settlement of Disputes

The Conditions of Contract shall contain provisions dealing with the applicable law and the forum for the settlement of disputes and for NCB, the national law of Nigeria shall prevail.

PART VI

Disposal of Public Property

(Procurement Act Sections 55 and 56)

160. (1)	Disposal of public assets shall be carried out in accordance with the Act, these Regulations and the Procurement Manual. For the purpose of this Act, public property is defined as resources in the form of tangible and non-tangible assets (ranging from serviceable to unserviceable)—

(d)	acquired on financial instruments (including shares, stocks, bonds, etc); and

(e)	acquired by good will and any other gifts of the Federal Government.

161.

(1)	A procuring entity shall maintain a record of its disposal proceedings and contract management for a period of ten years from the date of a decision to terminate a disposal activity or the date of com-pletion of a disposal activity, whichever comes first.

(2)	Where a contract is on-going or is challenged, the records shall be kept for one additional year after the completion of the contract or the settlement of the dispute, whichever comes earlier.

(3)	The records of a procuring entity specified in this Regulation shall be open to inspection by the Bureau during working hours.

162. (1)	The Accounting Officer shall ensure that the assets of a procuring entity are reviewed on an an-nual basis, to identify those which are obsolete and should be subject to disposal.

(2)	Assets to be disposed of shall be grouped in contracts or lots in a manner which attracts maxi-mum possible competition.

(3)	Where an asset is to be disposed of through a public auction, a procuring entity shall maximise the number of assets to be disposed of at a time in order to reduce the administration and transaction costs.

(4)	A procuring entity may pool assets for purposes of common disposal.

(5)	A procuring entity may appoint a Committee to identify assets to be disposed of on a periodic basis.

(6)	The disposal of assets whether or not listed in the Assets register for a procuring entity shall be planned and integrated into the income and expenditure budget projection of the procuring entity.

(7)	Before slating any public property for disposal, the Accounting Officer (whether acting in his own authority or at the direction of any superior or other authority) in charge of any public property set for disposal shall authorise the preparation of a valuation report for such property by an independent Evaluator, or such professional with the appropriate competence to carry out the valuation.

163. (1)	A user department or a procuring entity shall initiate the disposal process for assets under its management.

(2)	Initiation of disposal requirement may follow the recommendation of the Committee appointed by the Accounting Officer.

(3)	A disposal requirement shall include a clear indication of the assets to be disposed of and the approval to commence disposal proceedings for the specified assets.

(4)	Approval to commence disposal proceedings shall be approved by Tenders Board or the Ac-counting Officer.

(5)	Documentation related to the disposal requirement shall state the appropriate reference number from the asset register.

164. (1)	A procuring entity shall select one of the following disposal methods—

(a)	public auction;

(b)	public bidding;

(c)	sale to public officers;

(d)	trade-in;

(e)	transfer to another procuring entity;

(f)	destruction of assets.

(2)	A procuring entity shall take into account the following factors in selecting a disposal method—

(a)	the potential market value of the asset;

(b)	the volume of the asset, whether one-off or bulk;

(c)	the number and location of potential	bidders;

(d)	the location of the asset;

(e)	restrictions on export or end-users;

(f)	national security and public	interest	issues;

(g)	health and safety issues;

(h)	legal or human rights issues;

(i)	environmental considerations;

(j)     the trade-in value of the asset; and

(k)        the possibility of transferring the asset to another procuring entity.

165. A public auction may be used where—

(a)	there are no conditions of end-user or export restrictions attached to the sale; or

(b)	there is a large number of potential bidders or assets to be disposed of in one location and where an on site auction is arranged to avoid transport costs.

166. Public bidding may be used—

(a)	for high-value or unusual assets;

168. Disposal by Sale to a public officer may be used where—

(a)	where there is no likely benefit or financial advantage to a procuring entity, in using any other disposal method;

(b)	where the assets for disposal are a small number of low value items which are unlikely to attract public interest;

(c)	where the personal use of disposal assets would directly benefit the performance of a public officer in the execution of his or her duties within a procuring entity; or

(d)	in remote locations, where any other method of disposal would be difficult.

(3)	Disposal by sale to public officials shall be contracted to an independent agent.

(4)	Assets for sale to public officers shall be for personal use but not business or commercial use.

(6)	A public officer shall not be permitted to participate, in any disposal process as a bidder, except under the sale to public officers method.

169. (1)	Trade-in may be used where the trade-in of surplus assets to offset the purchase price of new items provides a convenient, economic and efficient way of upgrading equipment.

(2)	Notwithstanding subregulation (1), trade-in shall not be used where it prevents the operation of open and fair competition or where it reduces the value for money in a procurement process.

(3)	Trade-in shall not be used where factors other than price have to be taken into account in the disposal process.

170. Destruction of an asset shall be the least favoured method of disposal, but may be used—

(a)	on grounds of national security or public interest, health and safety, legal or human rights issues or environment considerations; or

(b)	where the asset has no residual value and it cannot be transferred to any other procuring en¬tity or converted or classified into another form with any value.

171. (1)	Transfer to any other procuring entity may be used where the other procuring entity shall make further use of the asset.

(2)	The cost of the asset shall be agreed between the two procuring entities.

(3)	Transfer may be at no cost, if it is uneconomic to charge for the asset.

FIRST SCHEDULE

Review and Approval of Procurement Decisions

1.	Review of Procurement Decisions

For all procurement subject to prior review in accordance with thresholds [specified below...] [an¬nounced separately in BPP Procurement Notes], BPP shall fulfil the review function. For this purpose, BPP

shall review the procurement arrangements proposed by the Procuring Entity, including contract packaging, applicable procedures, and the planning of the procurement process, for its conformity with the regulations and the Procurement Law. The Procuring Entity shall promptly inform BPP of any delay, or other changes in the implementation of the procurement plan and agree with BPP on corrective measures.

2.	Internal Procurement Review at the Procuring Entity

For all procurements below the prior review threshold, the Tenders Board of the Procuring Entity shall be the Approving Authority.

3.	The Procurement Unit (PU) of a Procuring Entity prepares all procurement documents, including pro-curement plans, in collaboration with the project and budget units, and prepares requests for approvals by the Approving Authority.

4.	The Procurement Planning Committee (PCC), which is composed of representatives of various de¬partments in a Procuring Entity, reviews procurement plans to ensure that they meet the needs and budget of the Procuring Entity and bids are on schedule with the needs assessment.

5.	Above the Prior Review Thresholds. With respect to all contracts above the amount indicated [below]

[in the BPP Procurement Note, issue #1	] the following will apply.

6.	In cases of prior review contracts where pre-qualification is used, the Procuring Entity shall, before pre-qualification submissions are invited, furnish BPP with the draft documents to be used, including the text of the invitation to prequalify, the pre-qualification questionnaire, and the evaluation methodology, together with a description of the advertising procedures to be followed, and shall introduce such modifications in said procedure and documents, as BPP shall direct.

7.	Subsequently, the Procuring Entity shall evaluate the submissions of the applicants in accordance with the standard evaluation form for pre-qualification; furnish to BPP for its comments the report evaluating the applications it received, the list of the recommended prequalified bidders, together with a statement of their qualifications and of the reasons for the exclusion of any applicant for pre-qualification. The Procuring En¬tity shall furnish this information to BPP before the applicants are notified of the Procuring Entity’s decision, and the Procuring Entity shall make such additions to, deletions from or modifications in the said list as BPP shall direct.

8.	Before bids are invited, either for contracts with or without pre-qualification, the Procuring Entity shall furnish to BPP for its comments, draft bid documents, including the invitation to bid; instructions to Bidders, which also include the basis of bid evaluation and contract award; and the conditions of contract and specifi-cations for supply of goods, or installation of equipment, or the civil works, as the case may be, together with a description of the advertising procedures to be followed for bidding when pre-qualification has not been used, and shall make such modifications in said documents as BPP shall reasonably request. Any further modification shall require BPP’s approval before it is issued to the prospective Bidders.

9.	For the evaluation of bids, the Procuring Entity shall use BPP’s Standard Bid Evaluation Report.

10.	After bids have been received and evaluated, the Procuring Entity shall, before a final decision on the award is made, furnish to BPP in sufficient time for its review, a detailed report (prepared, if BPP shall so request, by experts acceptable to BPP), on the evaluation and comparison of die bids received, together with the recommendations for award, the draft contract submitted by the lowest evaluated Bidders, and such other information as BPP shall reasonably request. The Report to BPP on the evaluation and comparison of bids shall be accompanied by the three lowest evaluated cost bids.

11.	When BPP determines that the intended award would be inconsistent with the bid document and the approved procurement procedures, it shall promptly inform the Procuring Entity and state the reasons for such determination. Otherwise, BPP shall provide its non-objection to the draft contract and authorise the Procuring Entity to proceed with the award and the signature of the contract. The Procuring Entity shall promptly confirm the award to the selected Bidders.

12.	If the approving authority is at a higher level than the Accounting Officer or Director General of a Pro¬curing Entity, the Tenders Board will after no-objection by the BPP, submit the proposed award to the desig¬nated approving authority and if approval is obtained so inform the Bidders. If approval is not given, the Tenders Board shall, discuss with the BPP what next steps to take. This procedure may lead to a cancellation of the procurement procedure. Because cancellations of procurement are very costly to the State and to the Bidders as well, and may undermine the trust between the public and private sectors, cancellation of the procurement procedure shall only be considered in cases where there is absolute certainty about the critical flaws in the procurement process.

13.	If the Procuring Entity requires an extension of bid validity to complete the process of evaluation, obtain necessary approvals and clearances and to make the award, it should seek BPP’s prior approval for the exten-sion of the bid validity period.

14.	If the Procuring Entity receives protests or complaints from bidders about the evaluation, the Procuring Entity shall send a copy of the Procuring Entity’s response to BPP for information.

15.	The terms and conditions of a contract shall not, without BPP’s prior approval, materially differ from those on which bids were issued or pre-qualification of contractors was carried out.

16.	One certified copy of the contract shall be furnished to BPP promptly after its signing.

17.	The description and amount of the contract, together with the name and address of the successful bid, shall be subject to public disclosure by the Procuring Entity and BPP, when the contract is signed and duly recorded by the Procuring Entity.

18.	Below the Prior Review thresholds, In all cases below the prior review thresholds of the BPP, the Pro-curement Unit shall prepare the procurement documents for submission to the Accounting Officer or the Tenders Board for approval.

19.	Post Procurement Review. The BPP shall order a bi-annual post review by independent consultants of at least twenty per cent of all the contracts in a Procuring Entity that are not subject to prior review, repre¬senting a representative sample of small medium and large contracts, to verify if procurement procedures were carried out in accordance with the regulations. The results of the Independent Procurement Reviews shall be shared with the Auditor-General and the Accountant General.

20.	Amendments, Modifications or Extensions. The Procuring Entity shall inform the BPP of the follow¬ing during contract administration, giving the reasons:

If an amendment to the contract, or change order, or extension would increase the original amount of the contract price by more than fifteen per cent BPP has the right to approve or reject such changes, and in the latter case, to propose alternative less costly modifications or recommend a reduction in the scope and size of the contract.

SECOND SCHEDULE

Domestic Preferences

Procurement Law

1.	Principles of Domestic Preference

A Procuring Entity may, and subject to the conditions below, grant a margin of preference in the evaluation of bids for goods and works launched under ICB. Such preferences may be granted—

(a) up to fifteen per cent for bids from domestic suppliers for goods domestically produced;

(b) up to seven and a half per cent for bids for works by domestic contractors.

[Section 36.]

2.	In such cases, advertising and the bid documents shall clearly indicate the level of the preference to be

granted, the information required to establish the eligibility of a bid for such preference (paragraphs	). The

bid document shall describe the evaluation procedure described below.

Preference for Goods

1.	Where a margin of preference is granted for goods manufactured in Nigeria responsive bids shall be clas-sified in one of the following three groups—

Group A: Bids from eligible domestic suppliers exclusively offering goods manufactured in Nigeria, if the eligible bidder establishes to the satisfaction of the Procuring Entity and BPP that—

(1)	labour, raw material and components from within the country of the Procuring Entity will account for thirty percent or more of the EXW (ex factory or off-the-shelf) price of the product offered; and

(2)	the production facility, in which those goods will be manufactured or assembled, has been engaged in manufacturing/assembling such goods at least since the time of bid submission.

Group B: All other bids offering goods manufactured in Nigeria.

Group C: Bids offering goods manufactured outside Nigeria that have already been or will be directly imported.

2.	The Procuring Entity will first review the bids to confirm the appropriateness of, and to modify as neces¬sary, the bid group classification to which Bidders assigned their bids in preparing their Bid Forms and Price Schedules.

3.	The prices quoted for goods in Group A and B shall include all duties and taxes paid or payable on the basic materials or components purchased in the domestic market or imported, but shall exclude the sales and similar taxes on the finished product.

4.	The prices quoted for goods in Group C shall be on CIP basis (place of destination) which is plus cost of inland transportation and insurance to the place of destination, but exclusive of customs duties and other im-port taxes already paid or to be paid.

5.	The evaluation of bids is carried out in the following steps—

(a)	In the first step, all bids in each group are compared to determine the lowest responsive bid in each group. Such lowest evaluated bids are then compared with each other, and if, as a result of this comparison, a bid from Group A or B is the lowest, it will be selected for award (i.e. no preference is needed.)

(b)	If as a result of the comparison under (a), the lowest evaluated bid is a bid from Group C, fifteen percent of the evaluated CIP bid price of this bid from Group C is added to the price of this bid (for comparison only) and the resulting price is then further compared with the lowest evaluated bid from Group A (which includes a minimum of thirty percent of value added lo¬cally). The lowest evaluated bid from this last comparison is then selected for award.

6.	In the case of turnkey contracts for the supply of a number of distinct items of equipment as well as ma¬jor installation and/or construction services, no margin of preference shall apply.

Preference for Domestic Contractors

1. For the purpose of the application of preference for domestic contractors, such contractors must first provide the evidence that the contractor, either as an individual or as a group, qualifies with the following provisions—

(a)	it is incorporated or otherwise organised in Nigeria;

(b)	its principal place of business is located in Nigeria;

(c)	at least fifty-one of the equity is held by nationals of Nigeria and its assets are not controlled by a foreign firm or firms;

(d)	its chief officers are nationals of Nigeria; and

(e)	at least fifty per cent of the persons who will perform services under the contract, whether employed directly or by a subcontractor, are nationals of Nigeria.

2.	Where a preference is granted for domestic contractors for works to be awarded on the basis of ICB, re-sponsive bids shall be classified in one of the following two groups—

Group A : bids from eligible domestic contractors, which have established to the satisfaction of the Pro¬curing Entity and BPP to be eligible for domestic preference.

Group B: bids from other (foreign) contractors.

3.	For the purpose of evaluation and comparison of bids, after having compared and adjusted all bids where necessary, an amount equal to seven and a half per cent, of the bid amount of the lowest evaluated bid of Group B will be added to that bid. If the bid from Group B is still the lowest evaluated responsive bid, this bid from Group B will be selected for award. If as a result of adding the seven and a half percent of the bid price of the lowest evaluated bid in Group B to that bid, the lowest evaluated responsive bid of Group A be¬comes the lowest, that bid from Group A will be selected for award.

4.	In the case of turnkey contracts for the supply of a number of distinct items of equipment as well as ma¬jor installation and/or construction no margin of preference shall apply.

THIRD SCHEDULE

Information to Bidders

Procurement Bill

Information for Bidders

This Annex provides information to potential Bidders interested in participating in public procurement.

[Sections 5, 6 and 17.]

Procuring Entity’s Role

The Procuring Entity is responsible for the procurement. It invites, receives, and evaluates Bids, and awards the contract. The Standard Bid Document and the terms and conditions of the standard contract between the Procuring Entity and the Supplier or Contractor define the rights and obligations of each contracting party.

The Procuring Entity reviews the procurement procedures, documents, Bid evaluations, award recom-mendations and the contract to ensure that the process is carried out in accordance with agreed proce¬dures, and administers the contract during execution.

Role of the Bureau of Public Procurement (BPP)

The BPP sets thresholds for the prior review of public procurement launched by Procuring Entities, and for contracts subject to “prior review” the BPP reviews the documents for their correctness and issues “Certificates of no-objection for contract award” and for large contracts “Certificates of no-objection for payments”.

If at any time in the procurement process the BPP concludes that the agreed procedures were not fol¬lowed in any material respect, or if the certification was done on the basis of incomplete, inaccurate or misleading information, the BPP may declare mis-procurement.

The BPP has the power to blacklist/debar any supplier, contractor, or service provider that contravenes the Procurement Act or the regulations made pursuant to this Act, and to maintain a list of firms and persons that have been blacklisted/debarred from participating in public procurement, and to publish this list in the Procurement Journal and or any media it deems fit.

If the BPP determines the engagement in corrupt or fraudulent practices by representatives of the Pro¬curing Entity or of the Bidders, the BPP may impose or cause to be imposed the applicable sanctions in the Procurement Act.

The BPP publishes the details of major contracts in the Procurement Journal and on its website.

The BPP publishes Standard Bidding Documents (SBDs) for various types of procurement. The regula¬tions require that the procuring Entities use these documents, with minimum changes as necessary to deal with project-specific aspects. The Procuring Entity also issues standard pre-qualification docu¬ments.

Information on Bidding. Invitation on bids may be obtained from the BPP Procurement Journal, the websites of the Procuring Entities and advertisements in leading national newspapers for national com¬petitive bidding and other procurement methods and widely used international newspapers for interna¬tional competitive bidding. This is also the case for prequalification.

Bidders’ Role

Once a Bidder receives the pre-qualification or Bid solicitation document, the Bidder should study the documents carefully to decide if it can meet the technical, commercial and contractual conditions, and if so, proceed to prepare its Bid. Bidders should then critically review the documents to see if there are ambiguities, omissions, internal contradictions, or any feature of specifications or other conditions which are unclear or appear discriminatory or restrictive; if so, it should seek clarification from the Pro¬curing Entity, in writing, within the time period specified in the Bid documents.

The criteria and methodology for the selection of the successful Bidders are outlined in the Bid solicitation documents, generally under Instructions to Bidders and in the section on Specifications. If these are not clear, clarification should be sought from the Procuring Entity. If a Bidder feels that any of the provisions in the bid document are inconsistent with the regulations, it should also raise this with the Procuring En¬tity.

It is the responsibility of Bidders to ensure the timely submission of fully responsive and compliant Bids, including all the supporting documents requested in the Bid solicitation document. Noncompliance with critical (technical and commercial) requirements will result in rejection of the Bid. If a Bidder wishes to propose deviations to a non-critical requirement, or propose an alternative solution, the Bidder should first quote the price for the fully compliant Bid and then separately indicate the adjustment in price that can be offered if the deviation or alternative solution is accepted. Once Bids are received and publicly opened, Bidders will not be required or permitted to change the price or substance of a Bid.

Confidentiality

As stated in paragraphs 91 of the regulations, the process of Bid evaluation shall be confidential until the award is notified to the successful Bidder. This is essential for the Procuring Entity reviewers to avoid corruption or breaching confidentiality, or even the perception of it if during evaluation, a Bidder wishes to bring additional information to the notice of the Procuring Entity, it should do so in writing in accordance with the Bid Document.

Complaints

The Procuring Entity is responsible for the selection and award procedure and Bidders should address themselves to the Procuring Entity for any queries, issues and possible complaints in the case of a com¬plaint regarding the procurement process for a specific bid, such complaint should first be introduced in writing to the Procuring Entity, in accordance with regulations 16 to 19. Information on contract award

Information on contract award will be published in the Procurement Journal and on the websites of the Procuring Entities concerned and the website of the BPP. If, after notification of award, a Bidder wishes to ascertain the grounds on which its Bid was not selected, it should address its request to the Procuring Entity. If a discussion is arranged, only the Bidder’s Bid can be discussed and not the Bids of competitors.

FOURTH SCHEDULE

Procurement Filing

1. The experience is that lack of an efficient filing system causes long and costly delays in the search for documents at critical moments when procurement issues arise (or when procurement post reviews need to be done, complaints arise. Independent Post Reviews are needed by BPP or procurement on maintaining an adequate procurement filing system in Procuring Entities. Below are some main elements of records of pro-curement proceedings.

•	Description of the goods, works or consulting services requested, usually in the invitation to bid (for goods and works) or the request for proposals for consulting services).

•	Document prescribing the selection of the bid method or consultant selection method and the rea¬son for this.

•	Lists of Bidders who submitted bids or proposals, with names and addresses, usually obtained from the registration of bid or proposal submissions and from the minutes of opening of bids and propos¬als.

•	Minutes of bid and proposal opening, with recording of prices.

•	Bid and proposal evaluation reports.

•	List and summary of clarifications asked during pre-qualification, bid/proposal submission and evaluation (per bid and per proposal).

•	Records of formal rejection of bids or proposals and the grounds thereof.

•	Records of procurement proceedings involving other than open competitive bidding, which did not result in a procurement contract and a statement on the likely reasons.

•	Document by which it was decided to proceed with direct contracting and the reason for this.
