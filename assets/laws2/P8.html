which shall be determined under and be subject to the provisions of this Act.

[No. 30 of 1996.]

2.	Persons on whom tax is to be imposed

(1)	Tax of an amount to be determined from the Table set out in the Sixth Schedule (in this Act re-ferred to as 'income tax”) shall be payable for each year of assessment on the total income of—

(i)	persons employed in the Nigerian Army, the Nigerian Navy, the Nigerian Air Force, the Nigerian Police Force other than in a civilian capacity;

(ii)	officers of the Nigerian Foreign Service;

(iii)	every resident of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja; and

(iv)	a person resident outside Nigeria who derives income or profit from Nigeria.

[Sixth Schedule.]

Individuals

(2)	In the case of an individual, other than an itinerant worker and persons covered under subsection (1) (b) of this section, tax for any year of assessment may be imposed only by the State in which

the individual is deemed to be resident for that year under the provisions of the First Schedule to this Act and in the case of persons referred to in subsection (1) (b) of this section, tax shall be imposed by the Federal Board of Inland Revenue.

[First Schedule.]

Itinerant workers

(3)	In the case of an itinerant worker, tax may be imposed for any year by any State in which the itinerant worker is found during the year:

Provided that—

(a)	in an assessment for any year upon an itinerant worker credit shall be given against the tax payable, but not exceeding the amount thereof, for any income tax already paid by him to any other tax authority for the same year; and

(b)	collection of so much of any tax imposed in a territory on an itinerant worker for a year of assessment as remains unpaid on the itinerant worker leaving that territory during that year shall remain in abeyance during his absence from that territory, and if he returns to that terri-tory having during his absence paid tax in some other territory for that year, credit shall be given against any unpaid tax in the first-mentioned territory, but not exceeding that unpaid amount, for the tax paid in that other territory.

(4)	In the case of a village or other indigenous communities, tax may be imposed for any year only by the law of the territory in which that community is to be found and the tax may be charged on—

(5)	In the case of income of a family recognised under any law or custom in Nigeria as families in-come, in which the several interests of individual members of the family are indeterminate or uncertain, tax may be imposed only by the territory in which the member of that family who customarily receives that income in the first instance in Nigeria usually resides.

Trustees

(6)	In the case of income arising to a trustee of any settlements or trusts, or estates or to an executor of any estate of a deceased person, tax may only be imposed by the territory of which the tax authority is the relevant tax authority in relation to such settlement, trust or estate and to the extent provided in the Second Schedule to this Act.

[Second Schedule.]

(7)	Nothing in this section shall be construed as imposing liability to tax on the personal emoluments of any person serving as other rank and accordingly any other enactment or law imposing tax on the income of individuals shall not apply:

(1)	Where, in respect of any business carried on by a person it appears to the relevant tax authority that for any year of assessment, the business produces either no assessable income or an assessable in-come which in the opinion of the relevant tax authority is less than might be expected to arise from that business or, as the case may be, the true amount of the assessable income of that person from the busi-ness cannot be readily ascertained, the relevant tax authority may for that year of assessment, in respect of that business, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Act—

(a)	if the whole of the operations of the business are carried on in Nigeria, assess and charge the person carrying on the business on such fair and reasonable percentage of the turnover of the business, as the relevant tax authority may determine;

(b)	his share in the income of the partnership, computed in accordance with the provisions of this Act after the deduction of charges to which paragraph (a) of this subsection applies in respect of all the partners but before the deduction of any other expenses of the partnership referable to a partner which would have been private or domestic expenditure within the meaning of section 21 of this Act if incurred directly by that partner.

(2)	When the income computed under paragraph (a) of this subsection results in a loss, the partner’s share therein shall be deducted from his gains or profits ascertained under the provisions of subsection (1) (b) of this section and he shall be deemed to have incurred a loss in the trade or business of partnership to the extent, if any, by which the deductible share exceeds those gains or profits.

(3)	For the purpose of subsection (1) of this section, the share of a partner in the computed income of a partnership shall be such proportion of that computed income as would accrue to him under the provisions of the partnership agreement if that computed income were wholly apportionable between the partners within the terms of the agreement, or where the computed income results in a loss, such proportion of that loss as would be chargeable to him if that loss falls to be allocated between the partners in the terms of the agreement.

(4)	The amount of the gains or profits or loss of a partner, ascertained under the foregoing provisions of this section, of any period, shall be deemed for all purposes of this Act to be his ascertained income or loss of that period from a trade, business, profession or vocation carried on by him during that period, and the provisions of Part III of this Act, other than section 21 (g) of this Act, shall not apply to that partner with respect to the income or loss.

(5)	The determination of the income or loss from a partnership or a partner therein shall be made by the relevant tax authority in relation to that partnership, and where any partner is taxable for a year of assessment in the territory of some other authority, the relevant tax authority shall supply to that other authority particulars of that determination.

(6)	An appeal against an assessment by any individual in so far as it relates to any partnership income or loss, shall lie only to the body of Appeal Commissioners or court specified for income tax purpose in a law of the territory of which the tax authority is the relevant authority in relation to that partnership.

(7)	For the purposes of paragraph 6 of the First Schedule to this Act, the income of a partner from a partnership in Nigeria shall be deemed to be derived from the territory of the relevant tax authority in relation to that partnership.

[First Schedule.]

(8)	The partnership, employee or agent in charge of the principal office or place of business of a partnership in Nigeria shall without notice or demand thereof register or cause to be registered with the relevant tax authority, a certified copy of the partnership deed or, where no written deed is in existence, particulars of any written or oral agreement under which the partnership is currently established and where any such particulars have been so registered, notice of any subsequent change therein agreed between the partners shall be similarly registered with that tax authority within thirty days of the agreement.

(9)	Where the particulars of any partnership have been registered under the provisions of subsection (8) of this section, the computation under this section of the gains or profits of a partner therein may be made by the relevant tax authority on the basis of those particulars as they apply at any relevant time and in the event of failure by a partnership to comply with any demand made under the foregoing subsection, notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (3) of this section, tax may be assessed and charged by the relevant tax authority as though the whole gains or profits of such partnership accrued to any individual partner therein or were divisible between any partner therein as may appear just and reasonable to the tax authority.

9.	Agricultural, etc., profit

The gain or profit of an individual from any land used by him for agricultural purposes or from live-stock shall, unless the relevant tax authority is satisfied to the contrary, be deemed to be the gain or profit which would be realised by him if the land were cultivated or used or the livestock were dealt with, as the case may be, in the manner and up to the average standard of cultivation, use or practice relating to the use of the land or the dealing with livestock prevailing in the neighbourhood.

10.	Employment

(1)	The gain or profit from an employment shall be deemed to be derived from Nigeria if—

(a)	the duties of the employment are wholly or partly performed in Nigeria, unless—

(i)	the duties are performed on behalf of an employer who is in a country other than Ni-geria; and

(ii)	the employee is not in Nigeria for a period or periods amounting to one-hundred and eighty-three days or more in any twelve month period commencing in a calendar year and ending either within that same year or the following year; and

(iii)	the remuneration of the employee is liable to tax in that other country;

(b)	the employer is in Nigeria, unless the duties of the employment are wholly performed, and

the remuneration paid, in a country other than Nigeria except during a temporary visit to or leave in Nigeria.

(2)	Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1) (b) of this section, the gains or profits from an employment by a Government in Nigeria shall be deemed to be derived from Nigeria wherever the re-muneration is paid if the employee performs the duties of that employment in a country other than Nigeria which country under an agreement or diplomatic usage exempts the employee from tax on those gains or profits.

(3)	The gain or profit from any employment exercised in Nigeria shall be deemed to be derived from Nigeria whether the gains or profits from the employment are received in Nigeria or not.

(4)	The gains or profits from any employment, the duties of which are wholly or mainly performed in Nigeria, shall be deemed to be derived from Nigeria during any period of leave of the employee from the employment, and any period of his temporary absence on duty from Nigeria.

(5)	Subject to the foregoing provisions of this section, the gain or profit from any employment, the duties of which are mainly performed outside Nigeria, shall be deemed to be derived from Nigeria to the extent that those duties are performed in Nigeria.

(6)	Notwithstanding any provision of this section, the gains or profits of an individual from any employment as a seafarer, other than any such employment in the Nigerian Navy or the Nigerian Ports Authority, shall be deemed to be derived from Nigeria only during any period in which the individual is serving under articles which he had signed in Nigeria or is performing stand-by duty on board a ship preparatory to his signing articles in Nigeria.

11.	Tax credit allowable against tax payable on income derived from outside Nigeria

Notwithstanding the provisions of section 3 (1) of this Act, where a resident derives income from a source outside Nigeria and the income is brought into Nigeria through Government approved channels, he shall be allowed a tax credit against the tax payable by him but the tax credit shall not exceed the proportion of his total tax for the year of assessment which that income derived from outside and brought into Nigeria bears to his aggregate income chargeable to tax in Nigeria.

12.	Nigerian dividends

(1)	The income from a dividend distributed by a Nigerian company shall be deemed to be derived from Nigeria, and shall be the gross amount of that dividend before deduction of any tax which the company is required to deduct on payment thereof under the provisions of any law in force in Nigeria at the relevant time imposing taxation on the profits of companies.

(2)	Any amount of the undistributed profit of a Nigerian company which is treated as distributed under the provisions of any law in force in Nigeria imposing tax on the profits of companies shall, for the purpose of this Act, be deemed to be income from a dividend accruing to any person who is a shareholder in the company in proportion to his share in the ordinary capital thereof at the relevant time, and the income from the dividend to be taken for assessment in his hands shall be his due proportion thereof increased by such amount as may be specified by the relevant tax authority in respect of tax deemed to be deducted at source.

(3)	The income from a dividend distributed by a Nigerian company shall be deemed to arise on the day on which payment of that dividend becomes due.

[Second Schedule.]

17.	Artificial transactions

(1)	Where a tax authority is of the opinion that any disposition is not in fact given effect to, or that any transaction which reduces or would reduce the amount of any tax payable is artificial or fictitious, the tax authority may disregard the disposition or direct that such adjustments shall be made as respects the  

income of an individual, an executor or a trustee, as the tax authority considers appropriate so as to counteract the reduction of liability to tax effected, or reduction which would otherwise be effected by the transaction.

37.	Charge of income tax

Subject to the provisions of this Act, the income tax that may be payable on the chargeable income of an individual ascertained in accordance with the provisions of this Act shall, in respect of each year of assessment, be assessed at the rate or rates specified in the Sixth Schedule to this Act so however that where after all deductions allowable under this Act the individual has no chargeable income or where the tax payable on the chargeable income of that individual is less than a half per cent of the total income of that individual, the individual shall be charged to tax at the rate of a half per cent of his total income.

[Sixth Schedule.]

(2)	Where arrangements have effect by virtue of this section, any obligation as to secrecy in this Act or in any law of a territory subject to or incorporating the provisions of this Act shall not prevent the disclosure to an authorised officer of the government with which the arrangements are made of such information as is required to be disclosed under the arrangements.

[Seventh Schedule.]

39.	Method of calculating relief to be allowed for double taxation

(1)	The provisions of this section shall have effect where, under arrangements having effect under section 38 of this Act, foreign tax payable in respect of an income in the country with whom the arrangements are made is to be allowed as a credit against tax payable in respect of that income in Nigeria, and in this section, 'foreign tax' means any tax payable in that country which under the arrangements is to be so allowed.

(2)	The amount of the tax chargeable in respect of the income which is liable to both tax and foreign tax shall be reduced by the amount of the credit admissible under the terms of the arrangement:

Provided that credit shall not be allowed against tax for any year of assessment unless the person entitled to the income is resident in Nigeria in that year.

(3)	The credit shall not exceed the amount which would be produced by computing, in accordance with the provisions of this Act, the amount of the income which is liable to both tax and foreign tax,  

and then charging it to tax at a rate ascertained by dividing the tax chargeable (before the deduction of any relief granted by this Part of this Act) on the total income of the individual entitled to the income by the amount of his total income.

(4)	Without prejudice to the provisions of subsection (3) of this section, the total credit to be allowed to an individual for any year of assessment for foreign tax under arrangements having effect under section 38 of this Act, shall not exceed the total tax payable by him for that year of assessment.

(5)	In computing the amount of the income—

(a)	no deduction shall be allowed in respect of foreign tax (whether in respect of the same or any other income);

(b)	where the tax chargeable depends on the amount received in Nigeria, that amount shall be increased by the appropriate amount of the foreign tax in respect of the income; and

(c)	where the income includes a dividend, and under the arrangements foreign tax not chargeable directly or by deduction in respect of the dividend is to be taken into account in considering whether any, and if so what, credit is to be given against tax in respect of the dividend, the amount of the income shall be increased by the amount of the foreign tax not so chargeable which falls to be taken into account in computing the amount of the credit.

(6)	Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (5) of this section, a deduction shall be allowed of any amount by which the foreign tax in respect of the income exceeds any credit given under the ar-rangements.

(7)	Subsection (5) (a) and (b) of this section shall apply to the computation of total income for the purposes of determining the rate mentioned in subsection (3) of this section, and shall apply thereto in relation to all income in respect of which credit falls to be given for foreign tax under arrangements for the time being in force under section 38 of this Act.

(8)	Credit shall not be allowed under the arrangements against tax chargeable in respect of the income of an individual for a year of assessment if he elects that credit shall not be allowed in the case of his income for that year.

(9)	A claim for an allowance by way of credit shall be made not later than two years after the end of the year of assessment, and in the event of dispute as to the amount allowable, the claim shall be subject to objection and appeal in like manner as an assessment.

(10)	Where the amount of a credit given under the arrangements is rendered excessive or insufficient by reason of any adjustment of the amount of any tax payable either in Nigeria or elsewhere, nothing in this Act or in any law of a territory, limiting the time for the making of assessments or claims for relief, shall apply to any assessment or claim to which the adjustment gives rise, being an assessment or claim made not later than two years from the time when all such assessments, adjustments and other determinations have been made, whether in Nigeria or elsewhere, as are material in determining whether any, and if so what, credit falls to be given.

PART VI

PART I

1.	Subject to Part II of this Schedule and notwithstanding Part III of this Schedule, the income of a settlement or trust shall for all the purposes of this Act be deemed to be the income of the settlor or person creating the trust, as the case may be, if—

(b)	that settlor or person makes use, directly or indirectly, by borrowing or otherwise, of any part of the income arising under the settlement or trust; or

(c)	the settlement or trust is revocable in circumstances whereby that settlor or person, or the spouse thereof, resumes control over any part of the income or assets comprised therein:

Provided that a settlement or trust shall not be regarded as revocable solely by reason of the fact that an income or asset comprised therein may revert to that settlor or person, or the spouse thereof, in the event of a beneficiary predeceasing that settlor or person, or of the happening of an uncertain event upon which the settlement or trust is limited.

2.	(1) For the purposes of this Part and Part III of this Schedule, the income of a settlement or trust, other than a settlement or trust to which the provisions of paragraph 4 of this Schedule apply, or of the estate of a deceased individual shall be so much of that income as is derived from a source in Nigeria and any of the income brought into or received in Nigeria.

(2) The amount of the income (in this Schedule referred to as the 'computed income”) of each period of twelve months ending on 31 December in each year shall be ascertained as though the provisions of Parts I and II of this Act applied thereto and—

(a)	there shall be deducted—

(i)	any expenses of the trustee or executor relative to the settlement, trust or estate which is authorised by the terms of the deed of settlement or trust or of the will, as the case may be;

(ii)	any annuity of fixed annual amount paid out of the income of the settlement, trust or estate in accordance with the provisions of the deed or will; and

(b)	if the income includes any gain or profit from a trade, business, profession or vocation, or a rent or premium, there shall be added or deducted, as the case may require, any sum which would have been added or deducted for the next following year of assessment under the provisions of Part IV of this Act if the income from those sources had been the assessable income of an individual for that year ascertained under the provisions of section 36 of this Act.

3.	The computed income of a year of a settlement, trust or estate shall be apportioned for the assessment in the following manner—

(a) where—

(i)	the terms of the deed of settlement or trust or of a will provide that the whole income of the settlement, trust or estate after deduction of any authorised expense or annuity of fixed amount is to be divided in specific proportions among the beneficiaries entitled thereto, from time to time; or

(ii)	by operation of law, on an intestacy, the income of an estate is to be divided in the manner referred to in sub-paragraph (a) (i) of this paragraph,

the income of each beneficiary of any year from the settlement, trust or estate shall be his similarly apportioned share of the computed income;

(3)	Where an individual incurs qualifying building expenditure or qualifying mining expenditure on the construction of a building, structure or works, he shall be entitled to two or more interests therein, and one of those interests is an interest which is reversionary on all the others, that interest shall be the relevant interest for the purposes of this Schedule.

5.	Sale of buildings

Where capital expenditure has been incurred on the construction of a building, structure or works and thereafter the relevant interest therein is sold, the individual who buys that interest shall be deemed, for all the purposes of this Schedule except the granting of initial allowances, to have incurred, on the date when the purchase price became payable, capital expenditure on the construction thereof equal to the price paid by him for the interest or to the original costs of construction whichever is the less:

Provided that where the relevant interest is sold—

(a)	before the building, structure or works has been used, the foregoing provisions of this para-graph shall have effect with respect to the sale with the omission of the words 'except the granting of initial allowances' and the original cost of construction shall be taken to be the amount of the purchase price on such sale;

(b)	more than once before the building, structure or works is used, the provisions of paragraph (a) of this proviso shall have effect only in relation to the last of those sales.

6.	Qualifying industrial budding expenditure

(b)	'industrial budding or structure' means a building or structure in regular use—

     (i)  as a mill, factory, mechanical workshop, or other similar building, or as a structure used in connection with any such buildings;

[Table I.]

(2)	Where capital expenditure is incurred on the purchase of an asset and either the purchaser is a person over whom the seller has control, or some other person has control over both the purchaser and the seller, then, the amount of an initial allowance to be made in respect of the expenditure shall be such an amount as the relevant tax authority may determine to be just and reasonable having regard to all circumstances relating to the asset and.control:

(1) Subject to the provisions of this Schedule, where in his basis period for a year of assessment the owner of an asset has incurred in respect thereof qualifying expenditure wholly, exclusively, necessarily and reasonably for the purposes of a trade or business carried on by him, whether or not an initial allowance may be made to him in respect of that qualifying expenditure, there shall be made to that individual for each year of assessment in his basis period for which that asset was used for the purposes of that trade or business an allowance (hereinafter called 'an annual allowance”) at the rate specified in respect thereof in Table II of this Schedule of the expenditure after the deduction of initial allowance where applicable:

Provided that an amount of N10 shall be retained in the accounts for tax purposes until the asset is disposed of.

[Table II.]

(2)	In the case of an asset in respect of which an allowance has been granted before the commencement of this sub-paragraph, an allowance shall be made in respect of the asset for the number of years of assessment which, if added to the number of years of assessment for which allowance has already been made, equals the number of years of assessment for which allowance is to be made under the provision of sub- paragraph (1) of this paragraph:

Provided that if an allowance has been made for a number of years which is equal to or more than the number of years specified under sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph, a single allowance shall be made for an amount which is N10 less than the residue of the qualifying expenditure for the year of assessment in which this sub-paragraph takes effect.

9.	Asset to be in use at end of basis period

An initial allowance or an annual allowance in respect of qualifying expenditure incurred in respect of an asset shall only be made to an individual for a year of assessment if at the end of his basis period for that year he was the owner of that asset and it was in use for the purposes of a trade or business carried on by him.

10.	Balancing allowances

Subject to the provisions of this Schedule, where in his basis period for a year of assessment the owner of an asset, who has incurred in respect thereof qualifying expenditure wholly and exclusively for the purposes of a trade or business carried on by him, disposes of that asset, an allowance (hereinafter called 'a balancing allowance”) shall be made to that individual for that year of the excess of the residue of that expenditure, at the date the asset is disposed of, over the value of that asset at that date:

11.	Balancing charges

Subject to the provisions of this Schedule, where in his basis period for a year of assessment the owner of an asset, who has incurred in respect thereof qualifying expenditure wholly and exclusively for the purposes of a trade or business carried on by him, disposes of that asset, a charge (hereinafter called 'a balancing charge”) shall be made on that individual for that year of the excess of the value of that asset, at the date of its disposal, over the residue of that expenditure at the date:

Provided that a balancing charge shall only be made in respect of the asset if immediately prior to its disposal it was in use by the owner in the trade or business for the purposes of which the qualifying expenditure was incurred and shall not exceed the total of any allowances made under the provisions of this Schedule in respect of the asset and, in cases falling under paragraph 19 of this Schedule, of any allowance or deduction made under any income tax law in Nigeria in respect of the capital cost of the asset.

12.	Residue

(1) The residue of qualifying expenditure, in respect of an asset, at any date, shall be taken to be the total qualifying expenditure incurred on or before that date, by the owner thereof at that date, in respect of that asset, less the total of an initial or annual allowance made to the owner, in respect of that asset, before that date.

(2)	For the purposes of this paragraph, an initial allowance or annual allowance shall be deemed to be made at the end of the basis period for the year of assessment for which any such allowance is made.

(a)	a building, structure or works of a permanent nature is disposed of if—

(i)	the relevant interest therein is sold; or

(ii)	that interest, being an interest depending on the duration of a concession comes to an end on the coming to an end of that concession; or

(iii)	that interest, being a leasehold interest, comes to an end otherwise than on the individual entitled thereto acquiring the interest which is reversionary thereon; or

(iv)	the building, structure or works of a permanent nature is demolished or destroyed or without being demolished or destroyed, ceases altogether to be used for the purposes of a trade or business carried on by the owner thereof;

(b)	plant, machinery or fixture is disposed of if it is sold, discarded or ceases altogether to be used for the purposes of a trade or business carried on by the owner thereof;

(c)	an asset in respect of which qualifying mining expenditure is incurred is disposed of if it is sold or ceases to be used for the purposes of the trade or business of the individual incurring the expenditure either on that individual ceasing to carry on the trade or business or on that individual receiving insurance or compensation monies therefor.

14.	Value of an asset

(1)	The value of an asset at the date of its disposal shall be the net proceeds of the sale thereof or of the relevant interest therein, or if it was disposed of without being sold, the amount which, in the opinion of the relevant tax authority, the asset or the relevant interest therein, as the case may be, would have fetched if sold in the open market at that date, less the amount of any expenses which the owner might reasonably be expected to incur if the asset were so sold.

(2)	For the purpose of this paragraph, if an asset is disposed of in such circumstances that insurance or compensation monies are received by the owner thereof, the asset or the relevant interest therein, as the case may be, shall be treated as having been sold and as though the net proceeds of the insurance or compensation monies were the net proceeds of the sale thereof.

(3)	So much of sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph as relates to the circumstances for determining the value of an asset by reference to the disposal of the asset other than by way of sale shall have effect—

(a)	in relation to an asset or the relevant interest therein disposed of, not being by way of bargain made at arm’s length; or

(b)	where the sale is between persons who are related to each other or between persons both of whom are controlled by some other person or one of whom has control over the other.

15.	Apportionment

(1)	A reference in this Schedule to the disposal, sale or purchase of an asset includes a reference to the disposal, sale or purchase of that asset, as the case may be, together with any other asset, whether or not qualifying expenditure has been incurred on the last-mentioned asset, and, where an asset is disposed of, sold, or purchased together with another asset, so much of the value of the assets as, on a just apportionment, is properly attributable to the first-mentioned asset shall, for the purposes of this Schedule, be deemed to be the value of or the price paid for that asset, as the case may be.

(2)	For the purposes of sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph, all the assets which are purchased or disposed of in pursuance of one bargain shall be deemed to be purchased or disposed of together, notwithstanding that separate prices are or purport to be agreed for each of those assets or that there are or purport to be separate purchases or disposals of those assets.

(3)	The provisions of sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph shall apply, with any necessary modifications, to the sale or purchase of the relevant interest in an asset together with any other asset or relevant interest in any other asset.

16.	Reference to asset to include part of an asset

A reference in this Schedule to an asset shall be construed whenever necessary as including a reference to a part of an asset (including an undivided part of that asset in the case of joint interest therein) and when so construed any necessary apportionment shall be made as may, in the opinion of the relevant tax authority, be just and reasonable.

17.	Extension of meaning of 'in use'

(1)	For the purposes of this Schedule, an asset shall be deemed to be in use during a period of temporary disuse.

(2)	For the purposes of paragraphs 7, 8 and 9 of this Schedule—

(a)	an asset in respect of which qualifying expenditure has been incurred by the owner thereof for the purposes of a trade or business carried on by him shall be deemed to be in use, for the purposes of that trade or business, between the dates hereinafter mentioned where the relevant tax authority is of the opinion that the first use to which the asset will be put by the individual incurring the expenditure will be for the purposes of that trade or business;

(b)	those dates shall be taken to be the dates on which the expenditure was incurred and the date on which the asset is in fact first put to use:

Provided that where an allowance has been given in consequence of this sub-paragraph and the first use to which the asset is put is not for the purposes of the trade or business, all such additional assessments shall be made as may be necessary to counteract the benefit obtained from the giving of the allowance.

18.	Exclusion of certain expenditure

Where an individual has incurred expenditure which is allowed to be deducted, in computing the gains or profits of his trade or business under section 20 of this Act, the expenditure shall not be treated as qualifying expenditure.

19.	Application to lessors

(1) Where the owner of an asset other than a building—

(a)	has incurred capital expenditure in respect thereof for the purposes of leasing that asset for use wholly and exclusively for the purposes of a trade or business carried on or about to be carried on by a person;

(b)	leases the asset to such person; and

(c)	during the whole or part of the term of the lease, the asset is used wholly and exclusively by such person in such trade or business,

the provisions of this Schedule shall apply, with such necessary modifications as the relevant tax authority may direct, as though such expenditure were incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of a trade or business carried on by the owner from the date when such expenditure was incurred and as though the owner were using the asset for the purposes of such last-mentioned trade or business in the way in which and for the period or periods during which the asset is in fact used in the first-mentioned trade or business. 

(2)	The provisions of sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph shall apply in the case of a building leased by its owner to any other person as though such leasing were a trade or business carried on by the owner and, if he incurred the capital expenditure in respect of that building after 31 March, 1955, irrespective of the use thereof intended by the owner at the time he incurred such expenditure.

(3)	For the purposes of this paragraph, in relation to the trade or business which an owner is to be treated as carrying on, his basis period for any year of assessment shall be taken to be the year immediately preceding that year of assessment.

(1)	The following provisions of this paragraph shall apply where either or both of the following conditions apply with respect to an asset—

(a)	the owner of the asset has incurred in respect thereof qualifying expenditure partly for the purpose of a trade or business carried on by him and partly for other purposes;

(b)	the asset in respect of which qualifying expenditure has been incurred by the owner thereof is used partly for the purposes of a trade or business carried on by the owner and partly for other purposes.

(2)	An allowance and a charge which would be made if both expenditures were incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the trade or business and the asset was used wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the trade or business, shall be computed in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule.

21.	Disposal without change of ownership

Where an asset in respect of which qualifying expenditure has been incurred by its owner has been disposed of in such circumstances that the owner remains the owner thereof, then for the purposes of determining whether and, if so, in what amount, an annual or balancing allowance or balancing charge shall be made to or on the owner in respect of his use of that asset after the date of such disposal, qualifying expenditure incurred by the owner in respect of the asset prior to the date of the disposal shall be left out of account:

Provided that the owner shall be deemed to have bought the asset immediately after the disposal for a price equal to the residue of the qualifying expenditure at the date of the disposal, increased by the amount of any balancing charge or decreased by the amount of any balancing allowance made as a result of the disposal.

22.	Application to professions and vocations

In relation to qualifying plant expenditure, the provisions of this Schedule shall apply as if references to a trade or business included references to a profession or vocation, the profits of which are assessable under this Act, and in relation to qualifying building expenditure, those provisions shall apply as if references to a trade or business included references to a profession, the profits of which are assessable under this Act.

23.	Partnerships

(1) The provisions of this paragraph shall have effect for the purposes of this Schedule, in relation to a trade or business and the person or persons hereinafter mentioned carrying on the trade or business, throughout the period (hereinafter called 'the relevant period”) being—

(a)	a period during which the trade or business is carried on by persons in partnership and at least one of those persons, engaged in carrying on the trade or business as a partner in a partnership at any time, is so engaged immediately after that time, whether as a partner in the same partnership or as a partner in a different partnership carrying on the trade or business; or

(b)	 the aggregate of any of the following periods which are successive—

(i) a period, ending immediately prior to a person becoming a partner in a partnership carrying on the trade or business, during which the person was carrying on the trade or business on his own account;

(ii)	a period ascertained under provision (a) of this sub-paragraph;

(iii)	a period during which a person is carrying on the trade or business on his own account, where that person was a partner in a partnership carrying on the trade or business immediately before that period.

(2)	The trade or business shall throughout the relevant period be deemed to be carried on by one and the same person (hereinafter called the 'deemed person”) and an allowance or a charge which would then fall to be made to or on the deemed person, under the provisions of this Schedule if the deemed person were an individual, shall be computed as though the deemed person had done all things which were done for the purposes of the trade or business by the person or persons actually carrying on that trade or business during the relevant period.

(3)	For the purpose of this paragraph, a basis period for a year of assessment shall be such period as the relevant tax authority shall determine by reference to the provisions of the definition of 'basis period' in paragraph 2 of this Schedule and to the provisions of sub-paragraph (2) of this paragraph:

Provided that, where at any time during the relevant period a person ceases to be engaged in carrying on the trade or business as a partner in a partnership or commences to be so engaged, the deemed person shall, for the purpose of determining basis periods under the provisions of this sub-paragraph and for that purpose only, be treated as having ceased to carry on the trade or business at that time and as having recommenced to carry on that trade or business immediately thereafter.

(4)	The amount of the computed allowance or charge in respect of an asset shall be allocated to the person, or apportioned amongst the persons, actually carrying on the trade or business, in the same manner as a capital loss, in the case of an allowance, or a capital gain, in the case of a charge, in respect of that asset would fall on or accrue to that person or those persons, if that loss or gain arose in the course of carrying on the trade or business and as a result of an event occurring—

(a)	in the case of an initial or annual allowance, at the end of the basis period by reference to which the allowance has been computed; and

(b)	in the case of a balancing allowance or charge, at the date of the disposal of the asset.

(5)	An amount so allocated to or apportioned to an individual in respect of a computed allowance or charge shall be treated as an allowance or charge for the purposes of the provisions of this Schedule relating to deductions from and additions to the remainder of assessable income and shall be made to or on him for the year of assessment for which the amount of the allowance or charge has been so computed:

Provided that, where an allowance or a charge falls to be recomputed, as a result of the application of the proviso to sub-paragraph (3) of this paragraph, all such additional assessments or repayments of tax shall be made as may be necessary to give effect to the provisions of this paragraph.

(6)	For the purposes of the provisions of this paragraph, an asset is not disposed of within the meaning of paragraph 13 of this Schedule if the asset is used for the purpose of the trade or business during the relevant period and at least one of the persons actually engaged in carrying on the trade or business has an interest in the asset, or in the relevant interest therein, during the relevant period.

(7)	In the application of this paragraph with any of the provisions of the other paragraphs of this Schedule those provisions shall be applied with any modifications which the relevant tax authority may consider necessary in order to give effect to the principles and provisions of this paragraph, and the relevant tax authority may, from time to time, prescribe rules embodying those modifications.

24.	Meaning of 'allowances made"

A reference in this Schedule to an allowance made includes a reference to an allowance which would be made but for an insufficiency of assessable income against which to make it.

25.	Claims for allowances

No allowance shall be made to an individual for a year of assessment under the provisions of this Schedule unless claimed by him for that year or where the relevant tax authority is of the opinion that it would be reasonable and just to do so.

26.	Election in double taxation cases

(1)	Where an individual makes a claim to an initial or annual allowance under this Schedule in connection with a trade or business, if the tax in respect of the profits of the trade or business is the subject of an arrangement, having effect by virtue of section 38 of this Act, between Nigeria and any other territory, for relief from double taxation, he may elect, at the time of making the claim or within such reasonable time thereafter as the relevant tax authority may allow, that allowance shall be calculated at a lesser rate than that provided for in paragraph 7 or 8 of this Schedule and in making the election he shall specify the amount of the lesser rate.

(2)	Where an election has been made under this paragraph, the amount of the lesser rate shall be taken to be the appropriate rate in relation to that allowance for all the purposes of this Schedule.

27.	Manner of making allowances and charges

(1)	The amount of a charge to be made on an individual under the provisions of this Schedule shall be made on him by making an addition to his assessable income for the year of assessment for which the charge falls to be made under the provisions of this Schedule:

Provided that where the charge falls to be made on an individual for a year of assessment, whenever necessary by reason of the assessment on that individual having become final and conclusive for that year or for other sufficient reason, the relevant tax authority may make an additional assessment on the individual in respect of the amount of the charge.

(2)	Subject to the provisions of this paragraph, the amount of an allowance to be made to an individual under the provisions of this Schedule shall be made to him by making a deduction from the remainder of his assessable income for the year of assessment for which the allowance falls to be made under the provisions of this Schedule.

(3)	For the purposes of this paragraph the remainder of the assessable income of an individual for a year of assessment shall be ascertained by first giving full effect to the provisions of sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph and to the provisions of section 36 of this Act relating to the deduction of the amount of a loss.

(4)	Where full effect cannot be given to a deduction to be made under sub-paragraph (2) of this paragraph for a year of assessment owing to there being no remainder of assessable income for that year, or owing to the remainder for that year being less than the deduction, the deduction or part of the deduction to which effect has not been given, as the case may be, shall, for the purpose of ascertaining total income (of the individual entitled to the deduction) under section 36 of this Act for the following year, be deemed to be a deduction for that year, in accordance with the provisions of sub-paragraph (2) of this paragraph, and so on for succeeding years.

(5)	Where an individual is entitled to a deduction under sub-paragraph (4) of this paragraph, or to a deduction in respect of a balancing allowance, in respect of an asset used in a trade or business carried on by him, for a year of assessment in which that trade or business permanently ceases to be carried on by him and full effect cannot be given to the deduction for that year owing—

(a)	to there being no remainder of assessable income for that year; or

(b)	to the remainder of his assessable income for that year being less than the deduction,

that deduction or the part to which effect has not been given, as the case may be, may, on a claim being made by the individual, be given by way of a deduction from the remainder of his assessable income for the preceding year of assessment, and so on for other preceding years, so, however, that no such deduction shall be given by virtue of this sub-paragraph for any year earlier than the fifth year before the first-mentioned year of assessment:

Provided that where a relief is given under this sub-paragraph in respect of the deduction, the provisions of sub-paragraph (4) of this paragraph shall cease to have effect in respect of that deduction for any year of assessment subsequent to the year of assessment in which such trade or business ceases.

(6)	Where a deduction falls to be given under the provisions of sub-paragraph (5) of this paragraph for any preceding year of assessment, whenever necessary, by reason of any assessment for a year having become final and conclusive, or for other sufficient reason, the relevant tax authority may, with respect to the year, make such repayment or set-off of the tax, or of any part of such tax, paid or charged for the year, as may be appropriate, in lieu of making the deduction.

(7)	In giving effect to the provisions of sub-paragraph (2) of this paragraph, the amount of capital allowance to be deducted from assessable profits in any year of assessment shall not exceed sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of such assessable profits of an individual, but any individual in the agro-allied industry or which is engaged in the trade or business of manufacturing shall not be affected by the restriction under this sub-paragraph.

(8)	For the purposes of this paragraph 'an individual in the agro-allied industry' is a person who—

(a)	establishes or manages a plantation for the production of rubber oil palm, cocoa, coffee, tea and similar crops;
