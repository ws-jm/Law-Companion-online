ANNEX II

Criteria for Listing Banned or Severely Restricted Chemicals in Annex III

In reviewing the notifications forwarded by the Secretariat pursuant to paragraph (5) of Article 5, the Chemical Review Committee shall—

(a) confirm that the final regulatory action has been taken in order to protect human health or the environment;

(b)	establish that the final regulatory action has been taken as a consequence of a risk evaluation. This evaluation shall be based on a review of scientific data in the context of the conditions prevailing in the Party in question. For this purpose, the documentation provided shall demonstrate that—

(i)	data have been generated according to scientifically recognized methods;

(ii)	data reviews have been performed and documented according to generally recognised scientific principles and procedures; and

(iii)	the final regulatory action was based on a risk evaluation involving prevailing conditions within the Party taking the action.

(c)	consider whether the final regulatory action provides a sufficiently broad basis to merit listing of the chemical in Annex III, by taking into account—

(i)	whether the final regulatory action led, or would be expected to lead, to a significant decrease in the quantity of the chemical used or the number of its uses;

(ii)	whether the final regulatory action led to an actual reduction of risk or to a significant reduction of risk for human health or the Party that submitted the notification;

(iii)	whether the considerations that led to the final regulatory action being taken are applicable only in a limited geographical area or in other limited circumstances; and

(iv)	whether there is evidence of ongoing international trade in the chemical.
