FIFTH SCHEDULE

[Regulation 12.]

Quality Control and Monitoring of Production Condition

General monitoring

Arrangements for checking and monitoring shall be made by the Federal Department of Fisheries 'Fish Inspection and Quality Assurance Branch' so as to establish whether the requirements laid down in this Fish Inspection and Quality Assurance Regulation’s policy are complied with. Such arrangements shall include in particular—

(1)	Check on the fishing vessels during their stay in the port.

(2)	A check on the conditions of landing and first sale.

(3)	An inspection at regular intervals of establishments to check, in particular—

(a)	whether the conditions for approval and registration are still fulfilled;

(b)	whether the fishery products are handled correctly;

(c)	the cleanliness of the premises, facilities and instruments and staff hygiene;

(d)	 whether identification marks are put correctly.

(4)	An inspection of the wholesale and auction markets.

(5)	A check on storage and transport conditions.

(6)	A check on fish or fishery products whether they are fit for human consumption.

Special Checks

Sensory assessment

Each batch of fishery products shall be submitted for inspection by fish inspectors of Federal Department of Fisheries 'Fish Inspection and Quality Assurance Branch' at the time of landing or before first sale to check whether they are for human consumption. This inspection comparison sensory assassinate carried out by sampling.

If the sensory examination reveals any doubt as to the freshness of the fishery products, use may be made of laboratory checks.

Laboratory checks

A. Chemical checks

(1) Samples shall be taken and subjected to laboratory analysis for the control of the following parameters—

(a)	TVB-N (Total Volatile Basic Nitrogen) and TMA N (Timothylamine Nitrogen);

(b)	Histamine.

Nine samples shall be taken from each batch. These shall fulfil the following requirements—

(i)	the mean value shall not exceed 100 ppm;

(ii)	two samples may have a value of more than 100 ppm but less than 200 ppm;

(iii)	no sample may have a value exceeding 200 ppm.

(2)	Contaminants present in aquatic environment

Without prejudice to other legislation concerning water protection and management, fishery products shall not contain in their edible parts contaminants present as the square environment such as heavy metals and organ chlorinated substances at such a level that the calculated dietary intake exceeds the acceptable daily or weekly intake for humans.

A monitoring system shall be established by the Federal Department of Fisheries to check the level of contaminations of fishery products.

(3)	The methods of analysis to be used to check the chemical parameters as well as sampling plan, and the acceptance levels for the chemical parameters are to be approved.

B. Microbiological analysis

Without prejudice to other legislation, the microbiological criteria, including samples, plans and methods of analysis, are to be laid down and approved when there is a need to protect public health.

SIXTH SCHEDULE

[Regulation 9.]

Packaging and identification marks

Without prejudice to other legislation relating to fishery product packaging, these conditions shall also apply in addition.

1.	Packaging shall be carried out under satisfactory conditions of hygiene, to proclude contamination of the fishery products.

2.	Packaging materials and products liable to enter into contact with fishery products shall comply with all the rules of hygiene, and in particular—

(a)	they shall not be such as to impair the organolepic characteristics of the fishery products;

(b)	they shall not be capable of transmitting to the fishery products substances harmful to human health;

(c)	they shall be strong enough to protect the fishery products adequately.

3.	With the exception of certain special containers inside of impervious, smooth and corrosion resistant material which are easy to clean and disinfect, which may be re-used after cleaning and disinfecting, packaging materials may not be re-used. Packaging materials used for fresh products held under ice shall provide adequate drainage for melt water.

4.	Unused packaging materials shall be stored in premises away from the production area and be protected from dust and contamination.

5.	It must be possible to trace for inspection purposes the establishment of dispatch of consignments of fishery products by means of both labelling and accompanying documents. For that purpose, the following information shall appear on the packaging and in accompanying documents in English language—

(a) the full address indicating the location of the establishment (street name and number, city, state and country);

(b)	identification of the establishment by its official registration number with the Federal Department of Fisheries;

(c)	the net weight in kilogramme of product in the package or bag;

(d)	description of the fish, e.g. Large, Medium, Small or Mixed, and the species name (e.g. Small Croaker).

6.	Fish shall be stored and packaged or boxed for sale according to species and size. The size ranges for large, medium or small for any species shall be in accordance with that approved by the Federal Department of Fisheries.

SEVENTH SCHEDULE

[Regulations 7 and 8.]

Storage and transport

1.	Fishery products shall, during storage and transport, be kept at the temperature laid down in these Regulations and in particular—

(a)	fresh or thawed products and cooked and chilled Crustacean and molluscan shellfish products shall be kept at the temperature of melting ice;

(b)	frozen fishery products shall be kept at an even temperature of 30°C or less in all parts of the products allowing for the possibility of brief upward fluctuations of not more than 3°C during transport.

2.	Vehicles used for the transport of fishery products shall be constructed and equipped in such a way that—

(a)	the temperatures laid down in these Regulations can be maintained throughout the period of transport;

(b)	if ice is used to chill the products, adequate drainage shall be provided in order to ensure that water from melted ice does not stay in contact with the products;

(c)	the inside surfaces do not adversely affect the fishery products;

(d)	 they shall be smooth and easy to clean and disinfect.

3.	Means of transport used for fishery products shall not be used for transporting other products likely to impair or contaminate fishery products.

4.	Fishery products are not to be transported in a vehicle or container which is not clean or which should have been disinfected

5.	Fishery products are to be transported in vehicles with covered and insulated body. Frozen products travelling over a distance of more than 30 kilometres should be transported in refrigerated vehicles.
