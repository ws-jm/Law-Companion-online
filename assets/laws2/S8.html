(5)	In this Act and in section 102 of this Act, 'loan capital" means any debenture stock, other stock or funded debt by whatever name known or any capital raised by any corporation, company or body of persons formed or established in Nigeria, which is borrowed, or has the character of borrowed money, whether it is in the form of stock or in any other form, but does not include any overdraft at the bank or other loan raised for a merely temporary purpose for a period not exceeding twelve months.

103.	Reduction of duty on loan capital issued for the purpose of the conversion or consolidation of existing capital

(1)	Where it is shown to the satisfaction of the Corporate Affairs Commission that the loan capital issued by any corporation, company or body of persons, in respect of which a statement is required to be issued under section 102 of this Act, has been wholly or in part applied for the conversion or con-solidation of then existing loan capital, that corporation, company or body of persons, as the case may be, shall be entitled to repayment in respect of the duty charged on the statement so delivered at the rate of twenty kobo for every #200 of the capital to which the statement relates which is so shown to have been applied for the purpose of the conversion or consolidation of the then existing loan capital; but this section shall not apply to any duty payable in respect of a mortgage or marketable security which has been paid on any trust deed or other document securing the loan capital which has been issued.

(2)	If it is represented to the Corporate Affairs Commission by such corporation, company or body of persons that loan capital about to be issued by them is to be applied, in whole or in part, for the pur-pose of the conversion or consolidation of existing loan capital, the Corporate Affairs Commission may postpone the time or the delivery of the statement and the payment of duty under section 102 of this Act until the capital has been issued or until such other time as the Corporate Affairs Commission may think fit for the purpose of enabling the payment and repayment of the duty to take place as far as prac-ticable as one transaction.

(3)	The repayment shall be made by the Accountant-General upon receipt from the Corporate Af-fairs Commission of such particulars as the Minister may generally or in any particular case require to be given.

104.	Relief from capital and transfer duty in case of reconstructions or amalgamation of companies

(1)	If in connection with a scheme for the reconstruction of any company or companies or the amalgamation of any companies it is shown to the satisfaction of a commissioner that there exist the following conditions, that is to say—

(a)	that a company with limited liability is to be registered, or that since the commencement of this Act a company has been incorporated by letters patent, Act or Law, or the nominal share capital of a company has been increased;

(b)	that the company (in this section referred to as 'the transferee company”) is to be registered or has been incorporated or has increased its capital with a view to the acquisition either of the undertaking of, or of not less than ninety per cent of the issued capital of, any particular existing company;

(c)	that the consideration for the acquisition (except such part thereof as consists in the transfer to or discharge by the transferee company of liabilities of the existing company) consists as to not less than ninety per cent thereof—

(i)	where an undertaking is to be acquired, in the issue of shares in the transferee com-pany to the existing company or to holders of shares in the existing company; or

(ii)	where shares are to be acquired, in the issue of shares in the transferee company to the holders of shares in the existing company in exchange for the shares held by them in the existing company,

then, subject to the provisions of this section, the provisions of subsections (2) and (3) of this section shall have effect with respect to the relief from capital and transfer duty as a result of the reconstruction or amalgamation of the company or companies, as the case may be.

[L.N. 131 of 1954 and L.N. 112 of 1964.]

(2)	The nominal share capital of the transferee company, or the amount by which the capital of the transferee company has been increased, as the case may be, shall, for the purpose of computing the duty chargeable in respect of that capital, be treated as being reduced by either—

(a)	an amount equal to the amount of the share capital of the existing company or, in the case of the acquisition of a part of an undertaking, equal to such proportion of the said share capital as the value of that part of the undertaking bears to the whole value of the undertaking; or

(b)	the amount to be credited as paid up on the shares to be issued as such consideration as aforesaid and on the shares (if any) to be issued to creditors of the existing company in con-sideration of the release of debts (whether secured or unsecured) due or accruing due to them from the existing company or of the assignment of such debts to the transferee company,

whichever amount is the less.

(3)	Duty under the heading 'CONVEYANCE OR TRANSFER SALE' in the Schedule to this Act shall not be chargeable on any instruments made for the purposes of or in connection with the transfer of the undertaking or shares or on any instrument made for the purposes of or in connection with the assignment to the transferee company of any debts, secured or unsecured, of the existing company, nor shall any such duty be chargeable under section 62 of this Act on a copy of any Act or Law or on any instrument vesting, or relating to the vesting of, the undertaking or shares in the transferee company:

Provided that—

(a)	no such instrument shall be deemed to be duly stamped unless either it is stamped with the duty to which it would but for this section be liable or it has, in accordance with the provisions of section 16 of this Act, been certified by the commissioner either that it is not chargeable with any duty or that it is duly stamped; and

(b)	in the case of an instrument made for the purposes of or in connection with a transfer to a company within the meaning of the Companies and Allied Matters Act, the provisions of this subsection shall not apply unless the instrument is either—

(i)	executed within a period of twelve months from the date of the registration of the transferee company or the date of the resolution for the increase of the nominal share capital of the transferee company, as the case may be; or

(ii)	made for the purposes of effecting a conveyance or transfer in pursuance of an agreement which has been filed, or particulars of which have been filed with the Cor-porate Affairs Commission within the said period of twelve months; and

[Cap. C20.]

(c)	the foregoing provision with respect to the release and assignment of debts of the existing company shall not, except in the case of debts due to banks or to trade creditors, apply to debts which were incurred less than two years before the proper time for making a claim for exemption under this section.

(4)	For the purposes of a claim for exemption under subsection (3) of this section, a company which has, in connection with a scheme of reconstruction or amalgamation, issued any unissued share capital shall be treated as if it had increased its nominal share capital.

(5)	A company shall not be deemed to be a particular existing company within the meaning of this section unless it is provided by the memorandum of association of, or the letters patent, Act or Law incorporating the transferee company that one of the objects for which the company is established is the acquisition of the undertaking of, or shares in, the existing company or unless it appears from the reso-lution, Act or Law or other authority for the increase of the. capital of the transferee company that the increase is authorised for the purpose of acquiring the undertaking of, or share in, the existing company.

(6)	In a case where the undertakings of or shares in two or more companies are to be acquired, the amount of the reduction to be allowed under this section, in respect of the duty chargeable in respect of the nominal share capital or the increase of the capital of a company, shall be computed separately in relation to each of those companies.

(7)	Where a claim is made for exemption under this section, the commissioner may require the de-livery to him of a statutory declaration in such form as he may direct, made in Nigeria by a legal practi-tioner, and of such further evidence (if any) as the commissioner may reasonably require.

(8)	If-

(a)	where any claim for exemption from duty under this section has been allowed, it is subse

quently found that any declaration or other evidence furnished in support of the claim was untrue in any material particular, or that the conditions specified in subsection (1) of this sec-tion are not fulfilled in the reconstruction or amalgamation as actually carried out; or

(b)	where shares in the transferee company have been issued to the existing company in consid-eration of the acquisition, the existing company within a period of two years from the date, as the case may be, of the registration or incorporation, or of the authority for the increase of the capital, of the transferee company ceases, otherwise than in consequence of reconstruction, amalgamation or liquidation, to be the beneficial owner of the shares so issued to it; or

(c)	where any such exemption has been allowed in connection with the acquisition by the trans-feree company of shares in another company, the transferee company within a period of two years from the date of its registration or incorporation or of the authority for the increase of its capital, as the case may be, ceases, otherwise than in consequence of reconstruction, amalgamation or liquidation, to be the beneficial owner of the shares so acquired,

the exemption shall be deemed not to have been allowed, and an amount equal to the duty remitted shall become payable forthwith, and shall be recoverable from the transferee company as a debt due to the Government of the Federation, together with interest thereon at the rate of five per cent per annum in the case of duty remitted under subsection (2) of this section from the date of the registration or in-corporation of the transferee company or the increase of its capital, as the case may be, and in the case of duty remitted under subsection (3) of this section of the said subsection from the date on which it would have become chargeable if this section had not been passed.

(9)	If in the case of any scheme of reconstruction or amalgamation, a commissioner is satisfied that at the proper time for making a claim for exemption from duty under subsections (2) and (3) of this section there were in existence all the necessary conditions for such exemption other than the condition that not less than ninety per cent of the issued share capital of the existing company would be acquired by the transferee company, the commissioner may, if it is proved to his satisfaction that not less than ninety per cent of the issued capital of the existing company has under the scheme been acquired within a period of six months from the earlier of the two following dates, that is to say—

(a)	the last day of the period of one month after the first allotment of shares made for the pur-poses of the acquisition; or

(6)	the date on which an invitation was issued to the shareholders of the existing company to accept shares in the transferee company,

and on production of the instruments on which the duty paid has been paid, direct repayment to be made of such an amount of duty as would have been remitted if the said conditions had been originally fulfilled.

(a)	references to the undertaking of an existing company include references to a part of the un-dertaking of an existing company; and

(b)	the expression 'shares' includes stock.

105.	Relief from transfer duty in case of transfer of property as between associated companies

Provided that no such instrument shall be deemed to be duly stamped unless either it is stamped with the duty to which it would but for this section be liable, or it has in accordance with the provisions of section 15 been certified by a commissioner either that it is not chargeable with any duty or that it is duly stamped.

[No. 28 of 1941.]

(2)	This section applies to any instrument as respects which it is shown to the satisfaction of the commissioner that the instrument was not executed in pursuance of or in connection with an arrange-ment whereunder—

(a)	the consideration for the transfer or conveyance was to be provided directly or indirectly by a person other than a company which at the time of the execution of the instrument was asso-ciated with either the transferor or the transferee; or

(b)	the beneficial interest in the property was previously conveyed or transferred directly or indi-rectly by such person as aforesaid.

(3)	For the purpose of this section, a company shall be deemed to be associated with another com-pany if, but not unless, both are companies with limited liability, and either—

(a)	one of them is the beneficial owner of not less than ninety per cent of the issued share capital of the other; or

(b)	not less than ninety per cent of the issued share capital of each of them is in the beneficial ownership of a third company with limited liability.
