CHAPTER T14

TRADE UNIONS ACT

An Act to make Provisions with respect to the formation, registration and organization of trade unions, and the Federation of Trade Unions.

[No. 31 of 1973, L.N. 62 of 1973, No. 1 of 1991, No. 4 of 1996 and No. 17 of 2005.]

[Date of commencement: 1st November, 1973]

PART I

Trade Unions

Registration of trade combinations as Trade Unions

I.	Meaning of 'trade union' in this Act

(1)	In this Act—

'trade union' means any combination of workers or employers, whether temporary or permanent, the purpose of which is to regulate the terms and conditions of employment of workers, whether the combination in question would or would not, apart from this Act, be an unlawful combination by reason of any of its purposes being in restraint of trade, and whether its purposes do or do not include the provision of benefits for its members.

(2)	The fact that a combination of workers or employers has purposes or powers other than the pur-pose of regulating the terms and conditions of employment of workers shall not prevent it from being registered under this Act; and accordingly, subject to the provisions of this Act as to the application of 

funds for political purposes, a trade union may apply its funds for any lawful purpose for the time being authorised by its rules, including in particular, if so authorised, that of providing benefits for its members.

(3)	A trade union within the meaning of this Act shall not be treated as having been formed by rea-son only of—

(a)	any agreement between an employer and persons employed by him as to the terms and con-ditions of that employment; or

(b)	any agreement for the instruction of any person in a profession, trade or handicraft; or

(c)	any agreement between partners as to their own business or any trading agreement between employers; or

(d)	any agreement imposing restrictions in connection with the sale of the goodwill of a business.

2.	Unregistered trade union prohibited from functioning

(1)	A trade union shall not perform any act in furtherance of the purposes for which it has been formed unless it has been registered under this Act:

Provided that nothing in this subsection shall prevent a trade union from taking any steps (includ-ing the collection of subscriptions or dues) which may be necessary for the purpose of getting the union registered.

(2)	Where a trade union registered under this Act ceases to be so registered, it shall not thereafter perform any act in furtherance of its purposes:

Provided that nothing in this subsection shall prevent a trade union from taking any steps which may be necessary for the purpose of dissolving the union.

(3)	If any act which is prohibited by subsection (1) or (2) of this section, is performed by a trade union, then—

(a)	the union and every official thereof; and

(b)	any member thereof who, not being an official thereof, took any active part in the performance of that act,

shall be guilty of an offence against this Act.

3.	Application for registration of trade union

(1)	An application for the registration of a trade union shall be made to the Registrar in the prescribed form and shall be signed—

(a)	in the case of a trade union of workers, by at least fifty members of the union; and

(b)	in the case of a trade union of employers, by at least two members of the union.

(2)	No combination of workers or employers shall be registered as a trade union save with the ap-proval of the Minister on his being satisfied that it is expedient to register the union either by regrouping existing trade unions, registering a new trade union or otherwise howsoever, but no trade union shall be registered to represent workers or employers in a place where there already exists a trade union.

[No. 22 of 1978.]

(3)	No staff recognised as a projection of management within the management structure of any or-ganisation shall be a member of or hold office in a trade union (whether or not the members of that trade union are workers of a rank junior, equal or higher than his own) if such membership or of the holding of such office in the trade union will lead to a conflict of his loyalties to either the union or to the management.

(4)	For the purposes of subsection (3) of this section, a person may be recognised as a projection of management within a management structure if his status, authority, powers, duties and accountability which are reflected in his conditions of service are such as normally inhere in a person exercising executive authority (whether or not delegated) within the organisation concerned.

[No. 86 of 1979.]

(5)	Every application made pursuant to subsection (1) above shall state the name under which it is proposed that the trade union to which it relates shall be registered and the address of the office which, if the union is registered, is to be the registered office.

(6)	Every such application shall be accompanied by two copies of the rules of the union, and by a list showing—

(a)	 the name, address, age and occupation of each of the persons by whom the application is signed; and

(b)	the official title, name, address, age, and occupation of each official of the union.

[No. 22 of 1978.]

4.	Matters to be provided for in registered rules

(1)	Every trade union shall have registered rules, which shall contain provisions with respect to the various matters mentioned in the First Schedule of this Act.

[First Schedule.]

(2)	Accordingly, the Registrar—

(a)	shall not register a trade union unless it has rules which contain such provisions as aforesaid; and

(b)	if he registers a trade union, shall at the time register its rules.

5.	Procedure on receipt of application for registration

(1)	Where an application for the registration of a trade union is received by the Registrar, the fol-lowing provisions of this section shall apply:

Provided that if the application appears to the Registrar to be defective in any respect, he shall notify the applicant accordingly and shall take no further action in relation thereto until the application has been amended to his satisfaction or a fresh application is made in place thereof.

(2)	The Registrar shall cause a notice of the application to be published in the Federal Gazette, stat-ing that objections to the registration of the trade union in question may be submitted to him in writing during the period of three months beginning with the date of the Gazette in which the notice is published.

(3)	Within three months after the end of the said period of three months the Registrar shall consider any objections submitted to him during that period and, if satisfied—

(a)	that no proper objection has been raised;

(b)	that none of the purposes of the trade union is unlawful; and

(c)	that the requirements of this Act and of the Regulations with respect to the registration of trade unions have been complied with,

shall, subject to subsection (2) of this section, and to section 6 of this Act, register the trade union and its rules.

(4)	The Registrar shall not register the trade union if it appears to him that any existing trade union is sufficiently representative of the interests of the class of persons whose interest the union is intended to represent.

(5)	If the Registrar refuses to register the union—

(a)	he shall forthwith send to the applicants a notice in the prescribed form to that effect, stating the grounds of refusal and specifying the date from which the time for appealing against the refusal is to run, and shall publish a notice to the like effect in the Federal Gazette; and

(b)	any official or member of the union may, within the period of thirty days beginning with the date so specified, appeal to the Minister against the refusal.

[No. 26 of 1996.]

(6)	The Registrar on registering a trade union shall issue a certificate of registration which, unless it is proved that the registration of the union has been cancelled, shall (except in any proceedings for the cancellation of the registration of the union on the ground that its registration was obtained by fraud or as the result of a mistake) be conclusive evidence that the requirements of this Act and Regulations with respect to the registration of trade unions have been complied with, and that the trade union is authorised to be registered and is a trade union for the purposes of this Act.

[No. 1 of 1999.]

(7)	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Act, the Registrar, shall on the coming into effect of this section of this Act, register the trade unions specified in Part A and Part C of the Third Schedule to this Act; and on such registration the said trade unions shall have all the powers and duties of a trade union registered under this Act.

[No. 1 of 1999 and Third Schedule.]

6.	Restrictions as regards names of trade unions

(1)	A trade union shall not be registered under a name identical with that of any existing trade union or so nearly resembling the name of any existing trade union as to be likely to deceive the members or the public.

(2)	A trade union shall not be registered under a name containing any words which, in the opinion of the Registrar, are deceptive or objectionable in that they contain a reference (direct or indirect) to any personage, practice or institution, or are otherwise unsuitable as name for a trade union.

(3)	If the Registrar refuses to register a trade union on the ground that the name under which it de-sires to be registered is, by virtue of subsection (2) of this section, not one under which it should be registered, any official or member of the union may require the matter to be referred to the Minister; and the decision of the Minister on such a reference shall be final.

(4)	Where on a reference under subsection (3) of this section, the Minister decides that a particular trade union may be registered under a certain name, the union may be registered under that name not-withstanding subsection (2) of this section.

(5)	The foregoing provisions of this section shall, with the necessary modifications, apply in relation to—

(a)	any proposed alteration of the name of the trade union; and

(b)	any proposal to form a new trade union by the amalgamation of two or more existing trade unions,

as they apply in relation to the original registration of a trade union.

7.	Cancellation of registration

(1)	Subject to the provisions of this section and of section 10 (2) of this Act, the Registrar shall cancel the registration of a trade union if it is proved to his satisfaction—

(a)	that the registration of the union was obtained by fraud or as the result of a mistake; or

(b)	that any of the purposes of the union is unlawful; or 

(c)	that after receipt of a warning in writing from the Registrar, the union has deliberately con-travened or continued to contravene any provision of this Act or the Regulations; or

(d)	the principal purpose for which the union is in practice being carried on is a purpose other than that of regulating the terms and conditions of employment of workers; or

(e)	the union though still in existence, has ceased to function; or

(f)	the union has ceased to exist.

(2)	Where the Registrar proposes to cancel the registration of a trade union under subsection (1) of this section, he shall send to the trade union at its registered office a notice in the prescribed form—

(a)	stating that he proposes to cancel the registration of the union, and specifying briefly the ground or grounds on which he proposes to do so;

(b)	specifying a date not less than two months after the date of the notice and stating that unless before that date he is satisfied that the registration ought not to be cancelled, he will proceed to cancel the registration on the expiration of the period of thirty days beginning with that date unless an appeal against the proposed cancellation is brought within that period.

(3)	Where¬-

(a)      the Registrar has sent a notice under subsection (2) of this section to a trade union; and

(b)	the trade union is still in existence on the date specified in the notice; and

(c)	the Registrar has not withdrawn the notice before that date,

any official or member of the trade union may, within the period of thirty days beginning with that date appeal to the appropriate court against the proposed cancellation.

[No. 26 of 1996 and No. 1 of 1999.]

(4)	The Registrar shall not cancel the registration of a trade union under this section before the ex-piration of the period of thirty days beginning with the date specified in the notice under subsection (2) of this section; and if an appeal against the proposed cancellation is brought during that period, he shall not cancel the registration unless the appeal is abandoned or the proposed cancellation is confirmed on the final determination of the appeal.

(5)	A trade union whose registration is cancelled under this section shall, as from the date of the cancellation, cease to enjoy the privileges conferred by this Act on trade unions; but any liability incurred by the union before that date shall not be affected by the cancellation and may be enforced against the union on or after that date as if the cancellation had not taken place.

(6)	On cancelling the registration of a trade union under this section, the Registrar shall send to the address at which, immediately before the cancellation, the registered office of the union was situated, a notice in the prescribed form stating the date on which the registration was cancelled and the grounds for the cancellation, and shall also cause a notice to the like effect to be published in the Federal Gazette; and the original certificate of registration of the union shall be delivered to the Registrar not more than thirty days after the date of the cancellation.

(7)	If a certificate which is required by subsection (6) of this section to be delivered to the Registrar is not delivered to the Registrar within the time prescribed by that subsection, every person who, on the date of the cancellation, was an official or member of the union shall be guilty of an offence against this Act.

(8)	The foregoing provisions of this section shall, with the necessary modifications, apply in relation to the registration of the Federation of Trade Unions as they apply in relation to trade unions.

[No. 17 of 2005.]

(9)	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this section, the Minister may, due to overriding public interest, revoke the certificate of registration of any trade union specified in Part A of the Third Schedule to this Act.

[No. 26 of 1996 and Third Schedule.]

8.	Proceedings on appeal against refusal or cancellation of registration

On an appeal under section 5 (5) or 7 (3) of this Act the appropriate court in question may make such order as it thinks proper; and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing provision, in any proceedings on such an appeal—

(a)	the court shall have all the powers vested by this Act in the Registrar, and may make any order which might or ought to have been made by the Registrar; and

(b)	the costs of and incident thereto, including the costs of and incident to any proceedings before the Registrar, shall be in the discretion of the court.

[No. 26 of 1996 and No. 1 of 1999.]

9.	Compulsory dissolution of trade union in certain circumstances

(1)	Where—

(a)	an application for the registration of a trade union is finally refused; or

(b)	the registration of a trade union is cancelled under section 7 of this Act,

the trade union in question shall be dissolved in accordance with its rules within the period of the three months beginning with the date of the final refusal or cancellation, as the case may be.

(2)	For the purposes of this section, an application for the registration of trade union shall be taken to be finally refused—

(a)	if no appeal from the Registrar’s refusal is brought under section 5 (5) of this Act within the period of thirty days mentioned in the said section 5 (5), at the end of that period; or

(b)	if such an appeal is brought within the said period and on the final determination thereof the Registrar’s refusal is confirmed, on the date of that final determination; or

(c)	if the matter has been referred to the Minister under section 6 (3) of this Act and the decision of the Minister confirms the refusal, on the date of that decision.

(3)	If a trade union which is required to be dissolved by subsection (1) of this section, within a par-ticular period is not dissolved within that period, the union and every official thereof shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine of N10 for each day on which the union remains undissolved after the end of that period.

10.	Voluntary dissolution of trade union

(1)	Where a trade union is voluntarily dissolved in accordance with its rules, there shall be delivered to the Registrar not more than thirty days after the date on which the union ceases to exist—

(a)	a notice in the prescribed form signed by a person who immediately before the dissolution was an official of the union stating that the union has been dissolved; and

(b)	the original certificate of registration of the union.

(2)	Where a notice under this section is received by the Registrar, section 7 of this Act shall not ap-ply, and the Registrar, when satisfied that the trade union to which the notice relates has been duly dis-solved, shall cancel the registration thereof, and shall notify the person by whom the notice was signed that the registration of the union has been cancelled.

(3)	If either the notice or the certificate of registration mentioned in subsection (1) of this section is not delivered to the Registrar as required by that subsection, every person who immediately before the dissolution of the trade union in question was an official thereof shall be guilty of an offence against this Act.

(8)	Nothing in this section shall be construed as affecting the validity of anything done by an official of a trade union before the date of the commencement of this Act or as rendering unlawful anything done by any such official before that date.

(2)	If any of the funds of a trade union are applied to the furtherance of political objective in con-travention of subsection (1) of this section the trade union and every official thereof shall be guilty of an offence under this Act.
