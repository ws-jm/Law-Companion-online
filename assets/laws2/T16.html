(2)	The provisions of this Act shall apply to every separate country within the Commonwealth, on the basis of reciprocity.

(4)	An order made under subsection (3) of this section shall recite and embody the specific terms of the Transfer Agreement or may apply the provisions of this Act to the country subject to such conditions, exceptions and qualifications as may be specified in the Order.

(5)	While an order made under subsection (3) of this section is in force in respect of any country, this Act shall apply to that country subject to the provisions of the order and to the terms of the Transfer Agreement as recited in the text of such order.

(6)	The power to vary an order made under subsection (3) of this section shall include power, where the terms of the relevant Transfer Agreement has been varied, to amend the order to recite or embody those terms; and if the Transfer Agreement to which such an order relates is determined or otherwise ceases to have effect, the President shall forthwith revoke the order.

2.	Modification of existing legislation

In any matter to which this Act relates, the relevant provisions of any other law in force in Nigeria, including—

PART II

Transfer of convicted offenders

3.	General principles

Any person convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment in one country (hereinafter referred to as 'the sentencing country”) for an offence may be transferred in accordance with the provisions of this Act to another country (hereinafter in this Act referred to as 'the administering country”) in order that he may serve the remainder of that sentence in the administering country.

4.	Transfer of a convicted offender

(1)	A convicted offender to whom this Act applies shall be informed by the sentencing country of the substances of the provisions of this Act.

(2)	A convicted offender may only be transferred following a request either by the sentencing coun-try or the administering country; but the convicted person may also apply for his own transfer and in doing so he may channel his application to either the sentencing or the administering country.

(3)	Where a convicted offender applies for his transfer, the country which receives that application shall, as soon as practicable, so inform the other country.

5.	Conditions for transfer

(1)	A convicted offender may be transferred to the administering country under this Act only on the fulfilment of the following conditions, that is to say—

(a)	if the convicted offender—

(i)	is a citizen or national of the administering country;

(ii)	has, with the administering country, such close ties of the kind that may be recognised by the administering country as sufficient to warrant a transfer under this Act;

(b)	if the judgment is final under the laws of the sentencing country;

(c)	if at the time of receipt of the request for transfer the convicted offender still has to serve not less than six months of the sentence or if the sentence is indeterminate;

(d)	if the transfer is consented to by the convicted offender or, where in view of his age or his physical or mental condition one of the two countries considers it necessary that a person en-titled to act on behalf of the convicted offender consents to the transfer; and

(e)	if the sentencing and administering countries mutually agree to the transfer.

(2)	In an exceptional case, both the sentencing and the administering countries may agree to a transfer notwithstanding that the time remaining to be served by the convicted offender is less than that specified under subsection (1) (c) of this section.

(3)	For the purposes of subsection (1) (a) (i) of this section and subject to section 28 of the Consti-tution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999, a person is a citizen of Nigeria if he falls within any of the conditions stipulated under sections 25 to 27 of the said Constitution.

[Cap. C23.]

6.	Obligation to furnish information

(1)	In order to assist the administering country to take a decision on a request for a transfer under this Act, the sentencing country shall send to the administering country information and documents specified in subsection (2) of this section, unless either party has reached a decision not to consent to the transfer.
