CHAPTER T9

[No. 23 of 1975.]

[Date of commencement: 21st May, 1976]

(b)	has, where applicable, wilfully failed to comply with the procedure specified in the Trade Disputes Act in relation to the reporting and settlement of trade disputes,

he may by order published in the Federal Gazette proscribe the trade union or association (in this Act referred to as 'the proscribed organisation”) and the proscribed organisation shall, as from the date of the order, cease to exist.

[Cap. T8.]

(2)	Where a proscribed organisation is a trade union, the union shall, not later than fourteen days from the date of the order under subsection (1) of this section, surrender its certificate of registration to the Registrar of Trade Unions who shall forthwith cancel such registration.

(3)	As from the commencement of an order under subsection (1) of this section, all properties (whether movable or immovable) of the proscribed organisation, whether held in the name of the organisation, or held by any person for or in trust for the organisation shall be forfeited to the Federal Government and shall vest in that Government free of encumberances without any further assurance apart from this subsection.

(4)	Any person who holds any property referred to in subsection (3) of this section shall, within fourteen days of the making of an order under subsection (1) of this section, or where the property comes into his possession after the making of the order, within fourteen days after the property comes into his possession, deliver such property to the Secretary to the Federal Government or notify him in writing of the place where the property may be recovered and, in the latter case, shall take all other steps as the Secretary to the Federal Government may require in the recovery of such property.

(5)	Any person who contravenes or fails to comply with any of the provisions of subsection (4) of this section shall be guilty of an offence and shall on conviction be liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years.

2.	Penalties for acts calculated to disrupt the economy

(a) who is or has been engaged in acts calculated to disrupt the economy or acts calculated to obstruct or disrupt the smooth running of any essential service; or

(b) has, where applicable, wilfully failed to comply with the procedure specified in the Trade Disputes Act in relation to the reporting and settlement of trade disputes,

shall be guilty of an offence under this Act.

[Cap. T8.]

(2)	Any person found guilty of an offence under subsection (1) of this section shall on conviction—

(a)     where such person is an employer or official thereof or an official of any association of em-ployers, be liable to a fine of N10,000;

and in addition to the foregoing penalties, any such person shall not, at any time after conviction for an offence under this section, continue to be or become a member, or as the case may be, continue to be or become an official of any trade union (including any faction thereof) any of the members of which such association or trade union are employed in essential services.

(3)	For the purposes of this Act, a person shall be taken as performing or assuming a leadership role in a trade union or faction thereof if it is proved that, at the material time or during the material period, he had performed functions or assumed duties which are normally within the competence of an official of a trade union or purported so to do.

(4)	In this section, unless the context otherwise requires, references—

(a)	to employer, include references to any director, manager, secretary or other similar official thereof or any person purporting to act in any such capacity; and

Where a trade union or association has been proscribed under section 1 of this Act—
