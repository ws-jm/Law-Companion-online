[First Schedule.]

2.	Primary standards

(1)	The Minister shall by an order cause to be provided, maintained or replaced standards of the metre and kilogramme which shall be the primary standards by reference to which, in Nigeria, all other standards of those units and of any other unit of measurement derived wholly or partly from any of those units shall be maintained.

(2)	The Minister shall within two years of the commencement of this Act and thereafter at intervals of not more than ten years or as may appear to him expedient, cause the value of each of the primary standards to be verified against the corresponding standards of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in France.

(3)	Until other provision is made by an order under subsection (1) of this section, the Nigeria primary standards shall be—

(i)	in the case of the metre, the bar described in Part I of the Second Schedule to this Act; and 

(ii) in the case of the kilogramme, the cylinder described in Part II of the said Second Schedule.

[Second Schedule.]

No person shall be appointed superintendent of weights and measures or deputy superintendent of weights and measures unless he has passed a qualifying examination set by the Board of Trade in England or an examination deemed to be equivalent thereto.

2.	Qualification for appointment of inspectors

No person shall be appointed inspector of weights and measures unless he has passed the Testamur Examination of the Institute of Weights and Measures Administration or an examination deemed to be equivalent thereto.

3.	Register of stamps, etc.

A register of all stamps, brands, seals and certificates of verification forms issued to inspectors shall be kept by the superintendent of weights and measures. All such stamps, brands, seals and documents issued to an inspector shall be kept by him under lock and key when not actually being used; and upon his ceasing to hold office an inspector shall surrender the same to the superintendent.

4.	Duty of inspector to check stock

An inspector shall at least once in every month check the stock of stamps, brands, seals and docu-ments in his possession and shall report immediately any deficiency or loss to the superintendent of weights and measures.

5.	Monthly report of fees and inspections

An inspector shall report to the superintendent every month the fees collected and inspections carried out on such forms as may be from time to time approved by the superintendent of weights and measures.

6.	Quarterly examination of standards, etc.

An inspector shall at least once in every three months, make a careful examination of the standards and instruments in his custody and shall report immediately to the superintendent of weights and meas-ures any deficiency or damage.

7.	Half-yearly tests of working standards

An inspector shall once every six months, or more often as the superintendent may direct, test or cause to have tested, all working standards under his control. Working standards shall be adjusted to agree with working standards more recently tested, or Nigerian trade standards, as the case may be.

8.	Duty of inspector before stamping, etc.

Before stamping any weight, measure or instrument or issuing any certificate of verification in respect thereof an inspector shall—

(a)	examine the same and ascertain that it complies with the appropriate conditions for acceptance for verification under these Regulations;

(b)	verify the same in a manner prescribed by these Regulations and ascertain that it is correct within the limits of error specified.

9.	Certificate to be delivered upon payment of fees

An inspector shall not deliver a certificate of verification m respect of any weight, measure or in-strument to the owner or user thereof except upon payment of the appropriate fee as specified in the Fifth Schedule to the Weights and Measures Act. Where the owner or user has made a request in writing for the inspector to attend his premises, the person requesting may be required to pay, in addition to statutory fees the reasonable travelling expenses of the inspector and the cost of conveying the standards and equipment consequent upon such attendance.

[Fifth Schedule.] 

10.	Charge of fees on inspector declining to stamp or issue a certificate

Where an inspector declines to stamp or issue a certificate of verification in respect of any weight, measure or instrument on the grounds that it does not comply with the requirements of these Regulations or is not within the specified limits of error, he shall charge the appropriate fee, except that the fee may be waived in cases where the inspector’s decision to refuse to issue a certificate of verification was reached as a result of visual examination only.

11.	Form of stamp

For the purpose of stamping any weight, measure or instrument an inspector shall use only a stamp issued to him by the superintendent of weights and measures.

12.	Obliteration of stamps and cancellation of certificates

An inspector shall obliterate the stamp and cancel the certificate of verification in respect of any weight, measure or instrument when the weight, measure or instrument is found—

(a)	upon test to have an error outside the limits specified in these Regulations;

(b)	to have been altered or tampered with in such a way that it no longer complies with the re-quirements of these Regulations;

(c)	to have been repaired or adjusted so that it becomes necessary to ascertain that the indications of the instrument remain correct throughout its range;

Provided that where, in the opinion of the inspector, the incorrectness or non-compliance is not such as to justify the immediate obliteration of the stamp and cancellation of the certificate of verification, he may leave with the trader a written notice calling upon him to have the weight, measure or instrument corrected within a stated period not exceeding four calendar months; the inspector shall obliterate the stamp and cancel the certificate of verification if the correction has not been made within such period.

13.	Kind of punch for obliteration

For the purpose of obliterating the stamp under regulation 12, the inspector shall use a punch of six- pointed star design. No other method of obliteration shall be used nor shall it be lawful for any other person than an inspector acting in pursuance of these Regulations to obliterate a stamp.

14.	Reference of weights, etc., not covered by regulations to superintendent

Where a weight, measure or instrument embodies a feature or principle of construction not covered by these Regulations or embodies some feature likely to render it unsuitable for trade use, the inspector shall refer the matter to the superintendent of weights and measures for a decision as to whether or not it is acceptable for verification.

15.	Non-stamping of certain weights

No inspector shall stamp or certificate any weight, measure or instrument which is not sufficiently strong to withstand ordinary use in trade.

16.	Prohibition of stamping, etc., weights and measures of unspecified denomination

(1)	No weight or measure shall be stamped or certificated by an inspector unless it is of one of the denominations specified in the Third Schedule to the Act.

[Third Schedule.]

(2)	Where the denomination or capacity of a weight, measure or instrument is not marked in full, it shall be marked only by one of the abbreviations set out in Table I to these Regulations.

17.	Inspector not to stamp or certificate incomplete instrument

An inspector shall not stamp or certificate any weight, measure or instrument unless it is complete in itself. No weight, measure or instrument shall bear a manufacturer’s or maker’s mark which might be mistaken for an inspector’s stamp.

18.	Examination of weights, measures and instruments

An inspector shall first examine weights, measures and instruments in the condition in which they are being used, with a view to seeing they are not unjust. When satisfied, the inspector shall test weights, measures and instruments in a clean condition, and if necessary, he may call on the owner or user to clean them.

19.	Limitation of the authority of inspector under section 8 of the Act

(1)	Where an inspector is authorised under section 8 of the Act by the superintendent of weights and measures to adjust weights, measures and instruments, such authority shall be confined to—

(a)	the adjustment of simple weights and measures;

(b)	the adjustment of counterpoise weights and sliding poises belonging to compound lever ma-chines;

(c)	the balancing of weighing instruments; and

(d)	the setting or recalibration of the measure adjustment on measuring instruments.

(2)	Any authorisation granted by the superintendent under the said section 8 shall be issued to indi-vidual inspectors by name and shall not permit adjusting to be undertaken by their assistants.

20.	Waiver of requirements of Regulations

Where it appears to an inspector in any special circumstances that it is impracticable or unreasonable for the owner or user of any weight, measure or instrument, to comply literally with any requirement of these Regulations, he shall consult the superintendent with a view to referring the matter to the Director-General, Ministry of Trade, who may if he thinks fit dispense with the observance of such requirements upon such conditions as he thinks fit in the special circumstances referred to him.

21.	Exemption from Regulations

These Regulations shall not apply to the following, that is to say—

(a)	in so far as they relate to material, weights, measures and instruments used in the manufacture of explosives; and

(b)	instruments or installations incorporating load cells or other electrical devices for the meas-urement of weight. Such instruments and installations shall be stamped and certificated by inspectors only on the instructions of the superintendent who shall in each case decide after due consultation with the manufacturers and users of the instrument or installation what tests and allowances shall be applied.

22.	Power of inspector to stamp and issue certificates contrary to Regulations

(1) An inspector may at any time during the period of two years immediately following the date of the commencement of these Regulations, stamp, or issue a certificate of verification in respect of, any weight, measure or instrument notwithstanding that such weight, measure or instrument does not comply with the requirements of these Regulations:

Provided that such weight, measure or instrument—

(a) complies with the requirements of the law in force immediately before the date of the com-mencement of these Regulations; and 

(b)	is not likely to facilitate the perpetration of fraud; and

(c)	is correct within the appropriate limits of error specified in these Regulations.

(2)	No certificate issued under paragraph (1) of this regulation shall be valid for more than twelve months from the date it was issued nor shall such certificate be extended under any circumstances by virtue of section 9 of the Act.

PART II Weights

23.	Examination of weights and conditions for acceptance for verification

(1)	All weights accepted for verification shall be made in one piece entirely of some solid metal other than lead except where lead is inserted for the purpose of adjustment. Weights made of soft metals or soft alloys, e.g. tin or solder, shall not be accepted. Avoirdupois weights shall not be made of aluminium or other metals of low density. Weights shall have smooth surfaces and be free from flaws or blowholes.

(2)	Every weight shall have its denomination clearly and permanently marked on the upper surface unless the small size of the weight renders marking impracticable.

WEIGHTS AND MEASURES (PRIMARY STANDARDS) ORDER

[Section 47.]

[Date of commencement: 1st December, 1965]

1.	Citation, extent and commencement

(1)	This Order may be cited as the Weights and Measures (Primary Standards) Order and shall apply throughout the Federation.

[L.N. 120 of 1965.]

(2)	This Order shall come into force on 1 December 1965, and accordingly the existing standards which, but for the fact that this Order comes into force on 1 December 1965, would under the Act become the Nigerian primary imperial standards on that date, shall cease to be standards for Nigeria on that date.

2.	The Nigerian primary standards

(1) The Nigerian primary standards of weights and measures are hereby declared to be—

(a)	in the case of the metre, the nickel steel bar described in Part I of the Schedule of this Order;

(b)	in the case of the kilogramme, the stainless steel cylinder described in Part II of the Schedule of this Order;

(c)	in the case of the pound, the stainless steel mass described in Part III of the Schedule of this Order;

(d)	in the case of the yard, the nickel steel bar described in Part IV of the Schedule of this Order.

[Schedule.] 

(2) The said Nigerian primary standards of the metre, kilogramme, pound and yard shall be under the custody of the Director-General of the Ministry of Trade and Tourism.

SCHEDULE

The Nigerian primary standards

PART I

The Nigerian primary standard of the metre

A bar of nickel steel of 'H”-section about 103 centimetres in length and 24 millimetres square in overall section marked 'SIP GENEVE No. 12202 20°C NI 58%.” The upper surface of the web of the 'H' is chromed and highly polished and is engraved with a main scale of fine transverse lines 1 centimetre apart numbered '0' to ' 100”, the spaces between these lines being further divided by shorter transverse lines 1 millimetre apart. This scale is cut by two longitudinal fine lines parallel to the axis of the bar. The length of the Nigerian Primary Standard Metre shall be measured between those two fine transverse lines of the main scale which are marked '0' and ' 100”, the plane of measurement to be co-incidental with the upper surface of the web of the 'H' and the line of measurement to be halfway between the two fine longitudinal lines and parallel thereto. Measurement shall be made at a temperature of 20° Celsius, the bar being supported on rollers approximately 1 centimetre in diameter at the points indicated by the arrows on one flank of the bar.

PART II

The Nigerian primary standard of the kilogramme

A solid cylinder of non-magnetic stainless steel approximately 5.5 centimetres in diameter and 5.5 centimetres in height marked 'FNI 1kg.”.

PART III

The Nigerian primary standard of the pound

A solid mass of non-magnetic stainless steel of cylindrical shape with a knob marked '1 lb. FN2' the cylindrical part being approximately 4 centimetres in diameter and 4 centimetres in height.

PART TV

The Nigerian primary standard of the yard

A bar of nickel steel of 'H”-section about 42 inches long and about 1 inch square in overall section marked 'Hilger and Watts Ltd. London No. 224/63/244. Standard at 68°F”. The upper surface of one of the uprights of the 'H' is engraved with a coarse scale of forty-one transverse lines about 1 inch apart and numbered consecutively '0' to '40' and the space between each of these transverse lines is divided into twenty equal parts by shorter transverse lines. The upper surface of the web of the 'H' is chromed and highly polished and is engraved with a main scale of fine transverse lines corresponding to the coarse scale and this main scale is cut by two longitudinal fine lines parallel to the axis of the bar. The length of the Nigerian Primary Standard Yard shall be measured between those two fine transverse lines of the main scale which correspond respectively to the lines marked '0' and '36' on the coarse scale, the plane of measurement to be coincidental with the upper surface of the web of the 'H' and the line of measurement to be half way between the two fine longitudinal lines and parallel thereto. Measurement shall be made at a temperature of 20° Celsius, the bar being supported on rollers approximately 1 centimetre in diameter at the points indicated by the arrows engraved on one of the flanks of the bar.

WEIGHTS AND MEASURES (DEFINITION OF UNITS) ORDER

[Date of commencement: 1st December, 1965]

1.	Short title and extent

This Order may be cited as the Weights and Measures (Definition of Units) Order 1965 and shall apply throughout the Federation.

2.	Definition of units

The metre, litre, kilogramme, ampere, ohm, volt and watt shall for the purposes of measurement falling to be made in Nigeria have the meanings respectively assigned to them in the Schedule hereto, being the meanings appearing to the Minister to reproduce in English the international definitions of those units in force at the date of the making of this Order.

SCHEDULE

Definition of Units of Measurement

Measurement of length

METRE

The metre is the length equal to 1 650 763.73 wavelengths in vacuum of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the level 2p 10 and 5d 5 of the Krypton 86 atom.

(General conference of Weights and Measures held in Paris in 1960).

Measurement of capacity

LITRE

The litre is the volume occupied by a mass of 1 kilogramme of pure water at its maximum density and under standard atmospheric pressure.

(General Conference of Weights and Measures held in Paris in 1901).

Measurement of mass

KILOGRAMME

The kilogramme is the unit of mass represented by the mass of the international prototype kilogramme. (General Conference of Weights and Measures held in Paris in 1901).

Measurement of electricity

AMPERE

The ampere is the constant current which, if maintained in two straight parallel conductors of infinite length and of negligible circular section and placed 1 metre apart in vacuum will produce between the con-ductors a force equal to 2 x 10'7 M.K.S. units of force per metre of length.

(General Conference of Weights and Measures held in Paris in 1948).

OHM

The ohm is the electrical resistance between two points of a conductor when a constant difference of potential of 1 volt applied between the two points produces in the conductor a current of 1 ampere, the conductor not being the seat of any electromotive force.

(General Conference of Weights and Measures held in Paris in 1948).

VOLT

The volt is the difference of electrical potential between two points of conducting wire carrying a constant current of 1 ampere when the power dissipated between these two points is equal to 1 watt.

(General Conference of Weights and Measures held in Paris in 1948).

WATT

The watt is the power which gives rise to the production of energy at 1 joule per second.

(General Conference of Weights and Measures held in Paris in 1948).

NOTE.—The reference in relation to each definition to a General Conference of Weights and Measures is a reference to the General Conference of Weights and Measures (convened by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures) at which that definition was recognised.
